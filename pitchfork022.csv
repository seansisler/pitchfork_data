"Everyone Is Crying Out to Me, Beware",Alina Simone,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf813d197565213b1eb/1:1/w_160/3a566ac8.jpg,2008-07-23 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11996-everyone-is-crying-out-to-me-beware/,54º40' or Fight!,"Yanka Dyagileva was a Russian poet and punk/folk hero whose work circulated throughout the country's counterculture underground. They were sometimes shoddy recordings making the rounds on often equally shoddy cassettes (the clandestine duplication/distribution process has been called ""magnitizdat,"" the audio equivalent of samizdat) whose modest packaging couldn't disguise the revolutionary sounds therein. Yanka's first album was titled Ne Polozheno, or ""Not Allowed"", which makes an emphatic point. She remained reasonably public, earning comparisons to Patti Smith, until 1991, when she went out for a walk one spring day, never to return. When her body was later recovered from a river the death was ruled a suicide (she was known to suffer from depression). She was just 24, and had left behind a legacy of just 29 original songs. At least Yanka lived to see the fall of the Soviet Union, and if her premature death ended a career rich with potential, what she did record clearly continues to resonate. For proof one need look no further than Ukrainian born but American raised singer Alina Simone, whose recent Everyone is Crying Out to Me, Beware pays tribute to the late Russian singer. In some sense the release also works as conduit. Yanka's music never got wide distribution, and, sung entirely in Russian, the meaning of her songs (if not the emotions) won't necessarily reach non-Russian speakers. Alina Simone does stick to Russian when singing Yanka, but at the same time she's made it easier for curious outsiders to enter Yanka's world. At the very least, Yanka's spare, rough-hewn songs are fleshed out with the evocative addition of trumpet, strings, slide guitar, and other favorable chamber embellishments. Since the songs are sung in Russian, what's left to go by is a) Simone's haunted channeling of Yanka's anguish and b) the song titles, which occasionally provide some useful mood-setting context. ""My Sadness is Luminous"", for example, perfectly encapsulates the part hopeful, part heartbroken track, which runs less than two minutes and features strings, quiet drums, and minimal acoustic guitar, plus Simone's wistful, sometimes whispered vocals. One might similarly project a yearning for escape onto a song titled ""Flocks are Flying"", especially as performed here. ""Special Reason"" and ""Sold"" (from Yanka's 1989 album of the same name, Prodano!) do indeed recall prime Patti Smith, and could have easily been amplified into something a little less austere than the renditions here. If the universality of raw emotion transcends any language barrier, at least Simone does provide one translation, for the song ""Beware"", which could pass for one of PJ Harvey's 4-track demos. It's chilling enough in Russian, but the printed lyrics paint a more explicit portrait of a particularly troubled soul surely shaped by an oppressive life spent in Soviet Siberia: ""I will have to swap the ritual
That I am sick and tired of
For a deadly missile
The squeaky chair at the table
For a child's scream around the corner
The wreath of tangles roses
For a depressive psychosis
The psychedelic paradise
For three bolts for the shack Everyone is crying out to me, Beware"" Simone herself has a leg up on most of her listeners, since she understands the literal significance of the lyrics, but it's to her credit that sung in Russian or not, she manages to convey their meanings quite clearly all the same.","Ukrainian-born, Brooklyn-based singer Alina Simone pays tribute to the late Russian folk-punk poet Yanka Dyagileva, with haunting results.

Cherry,Shit and Shine,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbfdc0084474cd0c29a9/1:1/w_160/83ac4771.jpeg,2008-07-23 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11999-cherry/,Riot Season,"Shit and Shine are a collective out of England and Texas, though it's hard to say from Cherry where any one member contributes, or even where the sound manipulation stops and the band begins. The record's vocals are often sampled from unknown sources, and only by the fifth track can you hear anything that sounds like a member of the band-- though it should be mentioned, even here it's a distorted, unintelligible howling that sounds like a demon's confession. The concert on the DVD included with the CD edition shows a communal live show, four or five drummers on the same beat, four people crowded around one table filled with keyboards and programmers. Most of these songs loop brief snippets of sound, only for the band to let it run for a minute before laying a queasier texture on top. The record's diversity and cut-and-paste nature make Cherry sound like a forgotten tape collection, dusty and suffering water damage, getting ripped, gutted, and made into a skulking cassette-tape mummy. We hear what sounds like chanting children trapped in a reverb cavern segueing into drums that sound stolen from Gary Glitter with a vintage radio voiceover that may as well be reciting a Hubert Selby novel. ""Honestly Don't"" takes bargain-basement metal riffery from the early 1980s and loops and stretches it until it ceases to make sense, while you could tell me ""Charm and Counter Charm"" was ""Erotic City"" played backwards and I'd probably believe you; its vulgar drum machine hiccups are turned into gobbling video game villains, and the whole track becomes impish and sinister. Some tracks are subtly subversive, like the repetitive watery guitar tones and stiff, ominous drumming that dominate ""Flower Petal Sword"" or ""Prize Winning"", while strange vocal effects like the cooing alien noise of the latter handily provide listeners with the creeps. Diverse as the album is, there's still some straight-up scare-your-parents noise, be it the ugly distorted barks of ""If You Knew Susie"", the yawning sludge of the title track, or the popping fireworks-like squeals that turn to screams from the static-laden in-between-station zones of the radio dial. While closing tracks ""High Brooms"" and ""The Rabbit Song"" are allowed the space to breath and drift to more natural conclusions, many tracks on Cherry end abruptly, given either just enough time or a little less to develop. The transitions are sudden and split the difference between thrilling and clumsy, as if they were edited while blindfolded. These abrupt jump-cut edits don't always serve the individual track, but they give the record as a whole its own energy and peculiar logic. The execution isn't perfect on every track, certainly, but Cherry is a great example of a record becoming more than the sum of its parts. Instead of treating the palette of noise-rock as nothing but different shades of confrontational or disorienting, they look at it as having limitless boundaries-- and Shit and Shine actually have the ideas to take advantage of it.","Trans-Atlantic collective combines psychedelia, tribal drumming, and strange vocal effects into a heady noise-rock brew.

Green Rocky Road,Karen Dalton,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc095e6ef95969322d5b/1:1/w_160/8ff89d7b.jpg,2008-07-23 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12009-green-rocky-road/,Delmore,"One of the endlessly repeated and therefore defining stories of Karen Dalton's career is that she hated recording so much that she had to be tricked into laying down the songs on her 1969 debut, It's So Hard to Tell Who's Going to Love You the Best. That may be true, but by now it's legend, portraying the contrary Okie as a true folk artist who rejected the commercial enterprise of making and selling music. It's not that cut and dry, of course: It seems she felt uncomfortable only with studios and practiced performances. In his liner notes for Koch Records' 1997 reissue of her debut, Peter Stampfel recalls that when Dalton was scheduled to sing harmonies on a Holy Modal Rounders album, she spent hours psyching herself up for the task, at one point even ripping out a bathroom sink. Recording-- or, perhaps more specifically, being recorded-- apparently didn't trouble Dalton very much. Since her rediscovery in 2006 via Light in the Attic's reissue of her second and final album, In My Own Time, two recordings from the early 1960s have surfaced: The first, the two-disc Cotton Eyed Joe, is a recording of a live performance at the Attic in Boulder, Colorado, captured by Joe Loop. Released less than a year later, Green Rocky Road is a more intimate set that Dalton recorded herself at home on the same reel-to-reel tapes. Acting as vocalist, accompanist, engineer, and producer, she overdubs guitar over her banjo tracks and even invites guitarist Richard Tucker and Loop to play on it. You can even hear the phone ringing and Dalton talking to her mother. Green Rocky Road is a much different listening experience than Cotton Eyed Joe, which she performed specifically for the small crowd around her, who listen raptly and applaud heartily. If that release is public, then Green Rocky Road is pointedly private. Here Dalton entertains no one but herself. In addition to singing traditional ballads like ""Nottingham Town"" and ""Skillet Good and Greasy"", she runs through pensive versions of ""Ribbon Bow"" and ""Katie Cruel"", which would appear later on her first and second albums respectively. They have all the informality of someone thinking aloud, which suits her signature vocals perfectly. ""Ribbon Bow"" sounds careful and simmering, with Dalton reaching down into her lower register to sound uncharacteristically foreboding-- an approach that adds a bit of malice to the lyrics. Her takes on ""Katie Cruel"" and ""In the Evening"" (which also appears on Cotton Eyed Joe) show just how malleable she considered these songs, open for any possible inflection or interpretation. Dalton's primary accompaniment, as always, is her trusty banjo, which she plays in a clawfinger style to give these songs a distinctive style that fits her free-floating vocals nicely. It rings out brightly on the cowboy song ""Whoopee Ti Yi Yo"" and the lover's lament ""Red Rockin' Chair"", and she adds dissonant notes to make ""Nottingham Town"" sound like a raga. In overdubbing, she seems to consider tempos and time signatures almost as restricting as a real studio. Opener ""Green Rocky Road"" overlays an acoustic guitar over her banjo, but the two instruments don't always mesh, lending the song an unrehearsed emotional push and pull. There's no telling what purpose she intended for these recordings, or if the mere act of setting these songs to tape was the extent of her endeavor. Possibly she might have planned to record over them, or give them away, or store them in some dusty attic box for another generation. Whatever the case, Green Rocky Road stands as a particularly personal statement, a career marker that shows where she was and what songs obsessed her at a particular moment. That we can listen to these songs nearly half a century later is certainly a benefit, but it never feels like her primary concern.","Recorded in the early 1960s, these intimate home recordings find the folk legend acting as vocalist, accompanist, engineer, and producer on this particularly personal statement.

Because Her Beauty Is Raw and Wild,Jonathan Richman,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbffea9e61561daa7387/1:1/w_160/a264b93e.jpg,2008-07-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12001-because-her-beauty-is-raw-and-wild/,VaporVapor,"As another understated Jonathan Richman album arrives, with remarkably little publicity, this Massachusetts native's influence can hardly be overstated. 1976's recently reissued The Modern Lovers is a proto-punk classic, foreshadowing hardcore punk's Minor Threat-led ""straight edge"" movement while inspiring artists from the Sex Pistols and David Bowie through Galaxie 500 and Art Brut. Richman's wide-eyed sincerity, developed further over subsequent solo LPs, also shines out of great indie-pop from the Television Personalities to Jens Lekman. But the last thing most people would expect from the There's Something About Mary guy is an album haunted by death. Because Her Beauty Is Raw and Wild, Richman's first proper LP since 2004's minor masterpiece Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love, sounds like more of the same low-key acoustic-pop that Richman and percussionist Tommy Larkins have made into practically their own genre over the years. There's even Richman's latest ode to a painter-- the ""Egyptian Reggae""-flavored ""No One Was Like Vermeer""-- plus two more foreign-language songs (one French, one Spanish, both so-so). It's just that, for Richman, our human imperfection only heightens our human emotions: whether natural beauty on the title track, or natural odors on ""The Lovers Are Here and They're Full of Sweat"". Richman and Larkins play their live shows without A/C, and the production here is just as warm and intimate, romanticizing the messy, ever-passing moment rather than striving for a digital perfection Richman probably considers drab and sterile. Like unruly hair or B.O., death is a fact of nature that polite society would prefer to cover up or ignore. It's also what gives love such precious urgency, Richman hints on the vibrant ""Time Has Been Going By So Fast"", which glories in impermanence as a feature and not a bug. Still, for all the poignancy of Richman's theme, he can come across as preachy on ""When We Refuse to Suffer"", which condemns anti-depressants as a way of avoiding the feelings that Mother Nature intended. Pain is natural, yeah, but it's asking a bit much for everyone to deal with it Richman's way, just as no recording, not even this one, is completely free of artifice. Does Richman wear sunscreen, or is that bad, too? It would be harder to sympathize with Richman if he weren't in such palpable agony. Reprising the Modern Lovers' ""Old World"", the singer bids a regretful farewell to a past he originally embraced. Finally, a devastating cover of Leonard Cohen's mortality-themed ""Here It Is"" is followed by the album's capstone, ""As My Mother Lay Lying"", which brings to the nursing home the quiet dignity those who pass through it deserve, and suggests a personal tragedy at the heart of a grief-stricken album. Richman's refusal to refuse to suffer makes for an occasionally uneven listen (""Our Party Will Be on the Beach Tonight"" is no party), but there's enough sad beauty in Raw and Wild to offer Richman devotees-- or anyone mourning a loved one-- some measure of solace. Even if it hurts a little.","Another understated album from the influential singer-songwriter arrives with little fanfare. In addition to another ode to a painter and a couple of foreign-language songs, Richman, uncharacteristically, brings his unique perspective to bear on a handful of songs about death.

My Haunted / Your Anchor,Lackthereof,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b653c0084474cd0c258a/1:1/w_160/9643a6cb.gif,2008-07-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11553-my-haunted-your-anchor/,Film Guerrero,"Lackthereof is the solo musical identity of Menomena's Danny Seim, but don't call it a side project: Seim had been producing self-released albums under the alias for years by the time he linked with Brent Knopf and Justin Harris to form Menomena. Seim put out six of them from 1998 to 2002, and in 2004, he released one through a label with the Christian the Christian LP. That was the same year he first performed live under the Lackthereof name as well, recruiting friends such as Viva Voce's Kevin and Anita Robinson to back him up. Seim has recently returned to his old, prolific ways, and his two most recent albums find him taking one last stand in the low minors before jumping to Triple A on Barsuk.* My Haunted*, a vinyl/digital release, is the second Lackthereof album to drop via FilmGuerrero, and true to the form of its predecessors, it has a home-spun, casual air to it. If you're used to Menomena's maximalist, heavily layered and sometimes abstract approach, don't expect this to sound much like it. To begin, the compositional approach is more conventional, with little-to-no involvement of crazy computer programs. The basic palette is acoustic guitar, vocals, and reverb, with Seim frequently layering his voice or slipping in a bit of percussion. ""The Columbia"", a haunting and repetitive crawl through a cavernous reverb chamber, is the album's most impressive track. A stuttering acoustic guitar alternates with Seim's layered pleas to ""float with me to the mouth of the Columbia."" Side one closer ""Both of Us"" is the other standout, with ghostly wordless harmonies and an odd, stream-of-consciousness structure. Other songs are more reserved-- opener ""It's Over"" sounds like a demo, with a vocal line that mirrors the guitar part, while there are several offerings that are little more than good-sounding sketches. The keyboard-heavy ""Century"" especially feels like it needs to blow up into a massive prog conflagration.* Your Anchor*, Seim's Barsuk debut, is much more widely available, and it rises nicely to the challenge of being Lackthereof's first high-profile release. He generates every sound on the album, from vocals to drums, and it feels like a happy medium between My Haunted and Menomena. The songs are fully fleshed, and a few are genuinely great. ""Choir Practice"" is especially awesome, with a hard drum beat and catchy vocal melody. Considering that the weakest part of an album by a multi-instrumentalist is very often the drums, Seim is dealing from a position of strength, and every song makes good on his abilities behind the kit. And he's no novice on the other instruments, either. ""Doomed Elephants"" has a great, hooky bassline; he plays surprisingly good slide guitar on ""Fire Trial""; and ""Ask Permission"" features a great instrumental break with jangling guitars rising over a smooth bed of Rhodes piano. The latter is one of the album's finest tracks, a confirmation that Menomena's ear for texture runs deep in all three members. Seim's vocals have a Stephin Merritt-like croak to them here-- on his closing cover of the National's ""Fake Empire"", he sounds like he's struggling to avoid keeling over from exhaustion. He self-harmonizes fairly well on several tracks, too, and indeed opens the album backing his own lead vocal with a hushed falsetto. If a Menomena album feels like Seim coming over for a visit with his fellow band members, My Haunted is a little more like a postcard sent from far away-- a few thoughts strung together to form a nice but not quite satisfying reminder of a friendship. To strain the simile further, Your Anchor is like a nice, long phone call-- appeasing, but still not the same as seeing someone. Overall, the different release strategies for the two records seem appropriate: The interesting but flawed limited release is reserved for the superfan, while most indie rock fans will likely enjoy the bigger and more widely distributed record. Both, however, further demonstrate Seim's wealth of interesting ideas, showcasing two distinct sides of his creative alter-ego.",,6.0,
Life Processes,"¡Forward, Russia!",by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc06c0084474cd0c29c0/1:1/w_160/066f4f77.jpg,2008-07-22 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12007-life-processes/,Mute,"The catch-all ""post-punk"" is a term wielded like a sword when a scalpel is required. That's partly because post-punk carts around the mismatched baggage of history and revisionism. Take, for example, Life Processes by ¡Forward, Russia!; a curious mélange of studied dance-punk and flailing hardcore, Life strides a couple of well-trodden paths. Whereas FR's first record, 2006's Give Me a Wall, utilized Bloc Party's hi-hat-and-guitar anthems, the enigmatic Processes attempts to lose you in the stereo horizon, adding ham-fisted stabs of distortion pedals and synthesizer swaths. Like Mystery Jets, ¡Forward, Russia! seem fascinated by anxious rock that twists elaborate melodies around their vocalist's fey falsettos. Only where Mystery Jets singer Blaine Harrison wryly borrows from both Bowie and XTC, ¡Forward, Russia!'s Tom Woodhead plumbs a sort of emotional arrogance usually reserved for American hardcore, while evangelizing the artificially heightened emotions of Peter Gabriel. Every part of Life Processes seems meticulously calculated with such antecedents in mind, laid out in every detail and implemented exactly to referential specification. ""We Are Grey Matter"", which transitions from the opener ""Welcome to the Moment (The Rest of Your Life)"", moves rotely up and down in volume and vocal intensity between verse and chorus, with Woodhead's dynamic shifts and shouts all seeming like inevitabilities. Sometimes it works to their advantage. Single ""Breaking Standing"" could have been a Synchronicity-era hit, riding dub-like guitar pulses and sixteenth-note hi-hats and staying out of the trouble that excess distortion could bring them; it's just about the tidiest cut they've ever performed. But then ""Gravity and Heat"" follows and provides a fitting study in opposites: indulgent math-rock bouncing between taut power chords and a high-pitched guitar dissonance. Besides that Woodhead falsetto, it's really nothing you haven't heard before. It's the sort of self-centered angst that engages, and almost wins, a war of attrition on your sense of cultural regurgitation. But if you're careful, you can dodge the emotional bullets and get close enough to see that, behind the lines, they're only firing other peoples' guns. Still, there are tangible progressions from Give Me a Wall to Life Processes. First, the group's maddening tendency to title its compositions chronologically by number (e.g., ""Sixteen"" is the sixteenth song the band wrote). While I'm sure the band thought it might be funny to make listeners struggle to discuss ""Nine"" (which is track 4 on Give Me a Wall) or ""Seventeen"" (track 6), they couldn't realistically carry on with the convention. But more than that, they seem keyed into a greater cause than that of faux politico in the dance club. with tracks like ""Breaking Standing"", ¡Forward, Russia! have gotten the hang of the fuzzy alchemy of composition.","Leeds, UK band's second record, released on Mute, shows them doing the same paint-by-numbers Bloc Party jams they produced on their first record.

A Long Way Around to a Shortcut,Sic Alps,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbdfeb335119a49ecb32/1:1/w_160/27c2716f.jpeg,2008-07-22 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11976-a-long-way-around-to-a-shortcut/,Animal Disguise,"Occasionally psychedelic and unabashedly noisy garage-rockers Sic Alps have grown a lot over just a smattering of singles (and one proper LP, 2006's Pleasures and Treasures), so the reverse-chronological order of this compilation puts their best foot forward. That said, it'll rob listeners of some insight into the band if they don't give the whole thing their attention instead of just jamming the ""Back"" button over and over after ""Strawberry Guillotine"" (though you could hardly be blamed). Like many of their peers, Sic Alps tend to press great material on vinyl and cassette singles in haltingly small runs, but thankfully, most of it is included here. The band's most recent material is their best and strangest. ""Description of the Harbor"" comes from an extended 12"" of the same name originally released last year, and it's a liberal seven-minute interpretation of a Strapping Fieldhands song that alternates between depth-charge distortion, atonal no-wave jamming, and plaintive piano-led vocals that could be coming from a basement church P.A. Yet the entire B-side of that single was filled with nothing but direct, concise, even innocent pop: ""Love Is Strange"" finds austerity in the hangover of ""Description"" via acoustic guitars and woodblocks, ""A Story Over There"", ""The News Today"", ""Message From the Law"", and ""Hey! Sofia"" are simply too immediate to be dismissed as Nuggets-minded retro retreads. ""Strawberry Guillotine"", the title track of another single from last year, is a slow and hiss-soaked proto-metal strut that manages to be damnably infectious.. To further reinforce their unpredictability, ""RATROQ"" from the same release sounds like running the volume knob back and forth with woodwind accompaniment, while ""The Drake"" is another perfectly catchy, impossibly heavy ditty where the accidental harmonics make it sound like the notes are punching black holes out of the space around them. The 2006 Teenage Alps cassette marked something new for the band-- still undoubtedly minimal and noisy, but inching towards being more melodic, or, alternatively, having more of a purpose when being decidedly un-melodic. ""When You Tell It"" is a perfect example, taking otherwise straightforward psychedelic pop and adding a head-swallowing feedback screech where a solo should go, while ""Texas (Is the Right State)"" puts the rubbery bass of vintage stoner-rock more firmly in their grasp. ""C'mon Pup"" meshes a perky, almost Disney-appropriate piano plink over indiscernible waves of distortion. ""Making Plans"" from 2006 is more typical languid bottom-heavy riffery, though even on this early single, the casual approach to recording and the distant, disconnected way the drums were recorded put Sic Alps some distance from your average long-haired slow-headbang rock. They've tried many things over these releases, and they've always come out a little left of the mark in the best way, making for something distinctive. Long Way Around walks backwards through their firmly weird current aesthetic to the still-weird two-man psychedelic sludge-rock where they began. It's an indispensable collection for those without the time or cash to track down these out-of-print singles, and for now, the best starting point for the band.","Gathering vinyl and cassette singles originally issued in tiny runs, Long Way Around shows how much this lo-fi garage-rock outfit has grown in a short period of time.

Fortress Round My Heart,Ida Maria,by: Stephen M.

On her debut album, Fortress Round My Heart, she howls like Janis Joplin, with a bit of soulful vibrato that almost sounds like grandstanding. She rasps like Courtney Love, similarly steeped in cigarettes and alcohol but without the manic aversion to actually making music. Ida Maria effervesces like Katrina Leskanich-- of Katrina & the Waves fame-- which brings to mind one-hit-wonder pronouncements (but what a hit). Chrissie Hynde is another touchstone, not only for her commanding presence but for her assumed sexual authority as well. And then there's that curious Sting reference in the album title, but let's give her the benefit of the doubt and call it a coincidence. Besides, Ida Maria is singing, not actively imitating anyone. Her performance on Fortress conveys a distinct personality that draws on a range of styles and influences but remains completely her own, whether she's confessing to being falling-down drunk or expressing her reservations about god. She conveys existential anger, sloshed self-doubt, religious whimsy, romantic compulsion, and determined vulnerability all with equal persuasiveness, and by all evidence, she has a blast from start to finish. Backed by a road-hardened band, her songs burst with pop-punk fury and fun, none more violently than the brain-smasher opener ""Oh My God"". The song begins with tense guitars and Ida Maria's throaty voice defying you to ""find a cure for my life,"" then turns strident on the chorus as if trying to be heard by the deity himself. She stutters and taunts through ""Morning Light"", stumbles triumphantly through ""Queen of the World"", and masks darker thoughts and boozier desperation with the fizzy bubblegum exuberance of ""Louie"" and ""I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked"". ""Keep Me Warm"" is the only ballad, but she navigates with just as much confidence, making the song all the more heartbreaking by addressing a cup of coffee and a pack of cigarettes Ida Maria has been kicking around her native Scandinavia and most of Europe for a few short years now, sharpening her singing and songwriting through almost constant touring. If there's a complaint to be made about Fortress, it's that the album sounds too sharp and too focused, polishing away some of her rougher edges. ""Drive Away My Heart"" never really revs its engine, but any song that follows ""Oh My God"" could be accused of traveling at too safe a speed. Later, she muses about god on ""Stella"" and ""See Me Through"", which never sound as incisive or as insightful as her own drinking and dating habits. The latter track ends Fortress on the only true bum note, rising and falling dramatically but never really getting across Ida Maria's sense of doubt. Still, overreaching is a forgivable flaw on an otherwise accomplished debut, which usually sounds so confident in its creator's insecurities.","Norwegian singer who broke through late last year with the stirring single ""Oh My God"" releases her debut full-length, in which she conveys existential anger, sloshed self-doubt, religious whimsy, romantic compulsion, and determined vulnerability all with equal persuasiveness.

22 Dreams,Paul Weller,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbfcea9e61561daa737b/1:1/w_160/dd1724e1.jpg,2008-07-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11998-22-dreams/,Yep Roc,"More than 30 years into his career, Paul Weller has made his most varied and surprising album. He's made plenty of good and even great records in the past, with the Jam, the Style Council and on his own, but 22 Dreams is really something unique in his catalog, and it's refreshing to hear him changing the script like this so late in the game. The album's 21 tracks (dream #22 is a story by Simon Armitage, included in the CD booklet) simultaneously introduce a host of new ideas to Weller's music and play like a microcosm of his career and musical life, ranging from crunching rock to piano ballads and truly dream-like psychedelia. It may be his finest solo effort, and easily hangs with its closest contenders, 1997's Heavy Soul and 1993's Wild Wood. There's a real sense on 22 Dreams that Weller had no expectations for it going in, that he simply let it flow, in somewhat the same way a dream can take you from a sandy beach to your parents' kitchen in the space of a heartbeat. And so its generally brief songs detour in ways none of his other albums do, wandering where his omnivorous muse leads them. Dig the way the sensitive soul-man piano ballad ""Invisible"" segues directly to the psychedelic instrumental ""Song for Alice"", a strange, harp-soaked tribute to the late Alice Coltrane that puts Weller's sometime suppressed love of jazz on full display. Those jazz elements come into play again on one of the album's best tracks, ""One Bright Star"", which rides a subdued tango rhythm and billows with clouds of piano. Spanish guitar, wordless and ghostly female vocals, and haunting orchestration complete the mood and provide a spooky playground for Weller's voice, which only gets more soulful with age. Part of that soulfulness has always been there-- he's naturally gifted with husky, powerful pipes-- but he's also learned how to phrase his melodies in such a way that it accentuates the soul element of his work. ""Have You Made Up Your Mind"", for instance, is a pretty basic British trad-rock song, but his vocal pulls it to another level. Weller's wide circle of friends, built largely during the height of the Britpop movement he played godfather to, puts plenty of collaborators at his disposal, including Blur's Graham Coxon (playing drums, no less), Robert Wyatt, Oasis' Noel Gallagher, and Gem Archer, and Ocean Colour Scene's Steve Cradock, a long-time collaborator who's on as co-producer as well. Even god gets a guest credit for the thunder and rain on the pastoral closing instrumental. God even speaks through guest narrator Aziz Ibrahim on ""God"", one of the album's more indulgent digressions, wherein he rebukes a prayerful man, excoriating him for ""only calling when you need me"" and telling him to ""look at you, not at me."" Even when they do fall a little flat, such digressions help to make 22 Dreams such an interesting, replayable album. This stands pretty much alone in Weller's catalog in terms of sheer eclecticism and unpredictable, dream-like flow. I give Weller a lot of credit wanting to change the usual script at this point in his career-- it's amazing to think that there were rumors he was done recording several years ago when he still had this much creativity in him. It's a good thing the rumors weren't true, because 22 Dreams is one of his most enjoyable solo albums.","Simultaneously introducing a host of new ideas and playing like a microcosm of his career and musical life, Weller's latest-- among his finest solo records-- ranges from crunching rock to piano ballads and truly dream-like psychedelia. Noel Gallagher, Robert Wyatt, and Graham Coxon guest.

There Is Loud Laughter Everywhere,Head Like a Kite,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbedc0084474cd0c2986/1:1/w_160/d975e34a.jpg,2008-07-18 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11988-there-is-loud-laughter-everywhere/,Mush,"You think the upcoming ""X-Files"" movie is gonna bring the ""Whoa-- late 1990s!"" roffles? Go ahead and dig up the soundtrack-- while certainly not a definitive work, it's still as good as you're gonna get in terms of charting one of alternative rock's more slippery slopes. Pressed between the impending millennium as well as the critical crush on technologically-aware, genre-defiant records like OK Computer, When I Was Born For The 7th Time, Odelay and, what was supposed to be the granddaddy of 'em all, The Fat of the Land, post-grunge got shook and starting rhinestoning up their flannel with anything that remotely could be considered electronica. This is how you end up with Filter doing a dubby cover of Three Dog Night's ""One"" and Better Than Ezra going trip-hop, to say nothing of Our Lady Peace's Spiritual Machines and Bush's Deconstructed. Despite its presence on uber-modern Mush, Head Like a Kite's second album feels like a total throwback to that very era, albeit far less risible than the aforementioned examples. While Dave Einmo's stage name implies some sort of fancy-free approach to his craft, this is the sort of minutely studied studio pop where the decision to dig in the digital crates for chintzy PSA samples takes as much precedence as writing memorable melodies. And that really illustrates the limitations for what the record can accomplish, since Einmo is primarily a songwriter at heart-- not nearly outré enough for the IDM-heads and just a bit too skewed for regular pop, it hits that enjoyable but often placeless template of music which reminds you of shopping for sharper work clothes than usual. The sinister, bass-driven beat of ""No Ordinary Caveman"" is a nice backdrop for Einmo's slack, Lou Barlow-ish voice and a far better exemplar of what HLAK could accomplish than tech-damaged Cake-walk like ""Listen Young Stunners"" and the vocoder-spiked ""Keano's Couch"" (think Man Man's ""El Azteca"" but twice as long). Even the cynicism feels like a 90s relic-- Einmmo is nowhere near enough of a tunesmith to pull of ""Big FM Radio Hit"", which is actually more like a 4th-gen replication of ""E-Pro"". More appropriate for that title is the Smoosh-assisted ""Daydream Vacation"", which shows Einmo as being perhaps more gifted as a facilitator; as they say in Hollywood, sometimes getting the right people in the room is enough. Still, Einmo hits his targets often enough to keep the pace moving-- ""We Were So Entangled"" is sorta maypole-esque, spinning ribbons but grounded, its tune recalling ""Feel Good Inc."" in a way suggesting that it's stuck somewhere in the back of his mind instead of the tip of his tongue. And even throughout the stylistic left-turns, there might not be giant hooks, but there aren't any barbs either-- whether it zips past your ears or becomes an enjoyable if somewhat impersonal expanse of 40 minutes (equal possibilities), it's never a chore. His previous album, Random Portraits of the Home Movie relied on a concept of sorts, interspersing snippets of Super 8 videos taken with his family, and while There Is Loud Laughter Everywhere is a solid sophomore effort, it could've used a similar touchstone to guide his intentions-- at least something other than the sonic blueprint of ""Natural One"", until he's truly ready to beat Barlow at his own game.","Combining Lou Barlow-like songwriting with samples, Head Like a Kite's second album feels like a throwback to the late 1990s, when post-grunge bands started rhinestoning up their flannel with anything that could remotely be considered electronica.

"A Guide To Love, Loss & Desperation",The Wombats,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe2eb335119a49ecb37/1:1/w_160/3f813de9.jpg,2008-07-18 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11978-a-guide-to-love-loss-desperation/,Roadrunner,"There's something about the heat of the summer months that makes us crave dumbly enjoyable entertainment, and it is in that spirit that this Liverpudlian trio is finally releasing its splashy, deliciously moronic debut stateside. Though the Wombats' first record came out in the UK last year, the art school chums were smart to wait for temperatures to rise in the colonies before unleashing A Guide to Love, Loss & Desperation. After all, even the snootiest art-house snob will spend sizzling July afternoons in meat-locker-cold multiplexes watching the latest explosion-ridden popcorn flicks, and this hooky, snotty collection is the aural equivalent of, say, Transformers or Indiana Jones. It's predictable, formulaic, often funny, and, with song titles like ""Let's Dance to Joy Division"", maddening in its attempt to capture the zeitgeist. But it's also broadly appealing in an uncontroversial way and fun as hell once you've given in to its sneaky charms. Sure, this is an album full of the kind of shouty, lager-drunk pop that Kaiser Chiefs, the Cribs, and Arctic Monkeys have all already graced NME covers for making, but the Wombats distinguish themselves from their fellow countrymen with some impressively supple vocal harmonies and a broad sense of humor. In fact, they might be the first of this most recent post-millennial wave of often indistinguishable Brit dance-pop artists to be enjoyable because they don't seem to take themselves (or their songs) that seriously. A Whiffenpoof-worthy a cappella opener, ""Tales Of Girls, Boys & Marsupials"", on which they use just those six words, stellar harmonies, and lots of jittery handclaps to preview the record's themes, proves their music school pedigree. But the rest of the album is a bit more predictable. The Wombats are at their best on songs like ""Kill The Director"", a simmering pub-dance track about the sad truth behind the clichés in soap operas and chic flicks. The song's name-dropping-- sample lyric: ""If this is a rom-com, kill the director/ Please...This is no Bridget Jones""-- may not serve these boys well when it comes to the longevity of their legacy, but celebrating disposable culture is precisely the point of these joyously disposable hooks. While many of their melodies are infectious, it's true that many of their songs shouldn't be as enjoyable as they are. ""Let's Dance To Joy Division"", for example, is a blatant pitch to get played at those same indie dance nights where Ian Curtis' band is a staple. But despite its hokey premise (and the fact that it contains cringe-worthy lyrics like ""Let the love tear us apart,/ I've found the cure for a broken heart""), its English children's choir (you can practically hear the school uniforms on the singers as they chant the chorus along with frontman Matthew Murphy), over-caffeinated rhythms, and power pop glee are rousing nonetheless. And ""Patricia The Stripper"", with its self-explanatory storyline of a ""coked-up, Botox girl"" who works the pole for a living, mixes rote dance punk cymbals with out-of-place moments of Coldplay falsetto for something akin to a Killers song delivered in an even heavier than usual British burr. Luckily, the band understands their limitations, so most of these tracks maintain interest by keeping their subjects straightforward and simple-- going to the doctor, moving to New York, having schoolyard crushes, dancing-- and never deviating from the breathless pace set by drummer Dan Haggis. And though their passable guitar parts-- all choppy downstrokes and wiry, insistent clangs-- lose their exuberance as the record stretches on, for at least the album’s first six tracks, they are played with such adolescent gusto that it's hard not to be won over. So crank up the A/C and turn up the volume; one suspects that this record, like summer itself, has a limited shelf life.","The 2007 debut from this Liverpool trio-- known for exuberant singles like ""Kill the Director"" and ""Let's Dance to Joy Division""-- gets a stateside release, just in time for summer.

Long Gone and Nearly There,Julie Ocean,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbdeabf31b7dc7155bb6/1:1/w_160/01c53027.jpg,2008-07-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11975-long-gone-and-nearly-there/,Transit of Venus,"Despite its effusiveness, power pop is a highly conservative genre, favoring a minimum of elements: infectious hooks, tight harmonies, driving tempos, and bittersweet brevity. A very few artists, such as the New Pornographers, can successfully tweak that formula without losing the immediacy of the form, while others, like Fight Songs-era Old 97s, distinguish themselves through their lyrics. But most power pop bands do it just well enough to risk becoming anonymous, following the formula so closely that they neglect to include themselves in their songs. D.C.'s Julie Ocean, fortunately, does not fall into that last category. They follow the same tried-and-true equation, but drop some unexpected elements-- Shakespeare quotes, French movie references-- into their songs, which they play loud and fast, turning the requisite power-pop sugar rush into something resembling punk intensity. All 1990s indie heroes should age so well: Julie Ocean-- their name comes from an Undertones song-- are headed by Jim Spellman, who played in Velocity Girl and more recently was tasered on CNN. The band itself is something of a D.C. supergroup, featuring ex-Saturday People guitarist Terry Banks, former Severin drummer Alex Daniels, and Weatherhead's Hunter Bennett on bass. Julie Ocean blows Raspberries to anyone expecting Dischord post-hardcore or some sort of post-rock cheerlessness. After honing their songs on local stages for nearly a year, their debut, Long Gone and Nearly There, hits like a combination punch: quick, jabby, out of nowhere. First out of the gate, ""Ten Lonely Words"" never sits still, streamlining its busy guitar and wistful lyrics into two quick minutes. ""#1 Song"" sounds a little more lived in, launches a volley of oohs, aahs, and whoos over the angsty lyrics and an insistent beat. ""My Revenge"" does, well, the same thing, but it doesn't sound repetitive, thanks to the sharp contrast between the album's brightest harmonies and darkest lyrics. This momentum-- almost businesslike in its concentration-- continues unabated through the jumpy ""At the Appointed Hour"", but stops cold on ""Here Comes Danny"". Sounding like early-90s college pop, it's the weakest track here, but also the longest. They repeat that pulled-punch hook mercilessly and indulge an unnecessarily long guitar solo-- though it seems to want to be the heart of the album, it sounds like a different band. After ""Here Comes Danny"", Long Gone never quite reaches the same heights, although there are some peaks, like the fidgety ""Complications"" and the roughed-up closer ""Looking at Me/Looking at You"". The album clocks in at 25 minutes-- not even that, since they cut off the last guitar chord mid-squeal. That's an abrupt end to a summery genre record whose sure-footed melodies and imaginative economy make it sound urgent and infectious, if not altogether remarkable.","Something of a D.C. supergroup fronted by Jim Spellman of Velocity Girl, Julie Ocean specialize in effusive power pop played with punk intensity.

The Coral Sea,Patti Smith & Kevin Shields,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf713d197565213b1e9/1:1/w_160/e9e85600.jpeg,2008-07-18 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11995-the-coral-sea/,Pask,"At this point, it's almost redundant to note that Patti Smith was a poet before becoming a singer/songwriter. Her ""transformation into a rock icon"" (as Victor Bockris put it in his book Patti Smith: An Unauthorized Biography) came not at a rock show, but at a legendary reading she gave in New York in 1971, years before she started making music. But poetry was not just her first medium-- you could argue that it remained her primary gig even after music made her famous. Because in her best songs, Smith performs her words as much she sings them. Nearly four decades on, Smith is still a compelling reader. Which is why The Coral Sea, a 2xCD set of two live performances of her 1996 book-length poem, is more than just an audiobook. Well, that and the fact that Smith chose Kevin Shields for instrumental accompaniment, which he makes primarily with guitar and effects. Spoken word set to improvised sound almost always involves some monotony and pretension, and Smith and Shields aren't immune. At times The Coral Sea is cringingly melodramatic, but given how often that is the case with spoken word, the duo avoids pitfalls more than one might expect. Smith wrote The Coral Sea in 1996 in tribute to her friend Robert Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS seven years before at age 42. She frames the artist's life as a sailor's voyage, and as Bockris noted, her verse has ""near-biblical formality, old-fashioned usages, and relentless mythologizing [that are] sometimes overrich."" The Coral Sea is an odd combination of unique descriptions (""The sky was black and glistening, as if spread with fresh tar""), new age-ish concepts (""The library of his inner self"") and purple prose (""Tiny arrows burned with the seductive poison of love."") There's not much detail in Smith's metaphors, and her narrative is too general to offer much concrete about Mapplethorpe. In fact, judging by what's included here, the book could be a chore to read. But Smith's performance adds power to words that might feel dead on the page, and clearly conveys the effect Mapplethorpe had on her. It takes a while for that effect to emerge. The first disc, a June 2005 concert at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, starts out lifeless, with little variety in Smith's voice or Shields' metronomic guitar. Halfway through the hour-long performance, things pick up, as Smith yells fervent imperatives over shimmering waves from Shields' amp. The climax rolls into the final track, when Shields smothers Smith much the way the sea swallows the Smith's sailor. The performance on disc two took place more than a year later, but the climax of the first show seems to have stuck. Here, Shields widens his palate, adding church-like organ, shivering vibrato, pastoral drones, and aggressive feedback. Smith opens up too, even singing occasionally, giving her words more color and urgency. A peak comes when she chants a simple mantra-- ""He liked to work/ He liked to feel/ He didn't like to think/ He didn't have to talk""-- over Shields' energetic noise. Later, Shields goes silent, clearing space for some of Smith's best, strangest lines, like ""He distracted himself by playing a game of assessing the value of his organs."" On the final track, the guitarist returns with heavy noise akin to the detonations heard in live versions of MBV's ""You Made Me Realise"". Moments like that make it worth wading through the album's less-exciting sections. The performance was probably more engaging to witness that it is to just hear (reportedly, films of ocean scenery were projected behind the duo), but Smith and Shields bring enough passion to The Coral Sea to make it ultimately transcend its flaws.","The new album from Patti Smith (that's good!) is two discs long (that's bad), and it's a collaboration with My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields (that's good!!) built around live performances of her 1996 book-length poem (that's ba...actually it turns out to be pretty good).

Something For All of Us…,Broken Social Scene Presents: Brendan Canning,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0dc0084474cd0c29d4/1:1/w_160/77f3b45f.jpg,2008-07-18 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12013-something-for-all-of-us/,Virgin,"As the chief songwriter and vocalist for Broken Social Scene, it seemed reasonable to expect Kevin Drew's solo debut, Spirit If..., to sound quite a bit like a BSS record. The first volume of Arts & Craft's Broken Social Scene Presents series, Spirit If... even flaunted its affiliations and similarities. Bassist Brendan Canning's record, Something for All of Us, seemed a surer bet to follow the trend set by the side projects of Andrew Whiteman (Apostle of Hustle) and Jason Collett: elaborating on themes and sounds given secondary status on BSS albums. Instead Something, chock-full of woozy sing-alongs and pulsing ballads, suggests that Canning is just as responsible for BSS's life-affirming guitar pop as Drew. Maybe it shouldn't be a surprise-- Canning, with Drew, was a founding member of BSS. But even playing in a band that sits dead-center in the underground rock sound spectrum, splitting the difference between pop/rock, noise/tunes, jam/punk, Canning seems like the median. After toiling for the mostly forgotten By Divine Right, he had his spotlight-turn on You Forgot It In People's ""Stars and Sons"". Since then, he has seemed content to work quietly as the band's melodic gut, counting out orbital, song-serving basslines. Canning-- curly locks, rimmed glasses, professorly beard-- even looks the part of MOR rock daddy. But you can hear Canning on Something; hear his clockwork eighth-notes on the can't-stand-still post-rock of ""All the Best Wooden Toys Come from Germany""; hear his propulsive under-thrum during bangers like ""Hit the Wall"" and ""Possible Grenade""; hear him even as Something credits Drew and BSS drummer Justin Peroff (as well BSS contributor Lisa Lobsinger, on vocals) as major contributors. Something is a Broken Social Scene Presents release, and the group does do a good job showing off and helping along Canning: from the cover, which cartoonishly features Drew, Peroff, and Whiteman, among others, to the familiar, rippling horn of James Shaw or Drew's buddying up on the choruses, his recognizable pipes mixed graciously low. Drew, a more unique singer and stronger writer than Canning, was also more likely to lapse into bullshit poetry or break out J Mascis as indie bling. Canning doesn't strut or preen nearly as well, but he is patient, good-natured, and seemingly in love with slip'n'slide guitar rave-ups. Something is far from exact in its arrangements and structure; where Galaxie 500 smoothed over many of the distinguishing points of the Velvet Underground, Canning takes his six-string terrycloth and spreads around any number of mid-1990s guitar rockers. ""Churches Under the Stairs"" is the simplest brand of alt-rock-- throbbing bass, lots of tom hits, and two guitars splashing in a kiddie-pool of distortion. Lobsinger's honeyed exhalations turn the rolling piano chords of ""Antique Bull"" into a fulfillingy forgettable Breeders song. ""Chameleon"" morphs a little, sure, but you'll know exactly where it is at all times, a lilting drone followed by martial percussion and tentative trumpets before the tempo picks up and the group chorus-- inevitable from the very first moments-- gets its fingers deep into some of that feel good: ""You/ You can throw your arms up/ You/ You can be at ease/ Stick to things that remind you/ Of where you used to be."" There's little risk-taking, but Canning is more than capable of the high-pitched acoustic balladeering of ""Snowballs and Icicles"" or the red-eared, last dance crawl of ""Been at It So Long"". Something succeeds because Canning knows his strengths, or perhaps because his strengths aren't particularly volatile (see Drew, Kevin), but when he tries to carve out too ripe a melody-- the repeated choruses of ""You bet your life boy"" on the title track grow stale-- he sounds a bit out of his league. There's little defense for the blockheaded funk-rock of ""Love Is New"" which wonders-- for four full minutes-- what Girls Against Boys might've sounded like sober. Mostly, Something lives up to its everyman title by removing the truly heart-pounding moments of a BSS record and replacing them with a sense of community, easy friendship, and a kickass guitar pedal collection.","Chock full of woozy sing-alongs and pulsing ballads, Brendan Canning's debut solo album suggests he's just as responsible for Broken Social Scene's life-affirming guitar pop as Kevin Drew.

"Tout Seul dans la Forêt en Plein Jour, Avez-Vous Peur?",Woelv,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe713d197565213b1c3/1:1/w_160/8976a08d.jpg,2008-07-17 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11983-tout-seul-dans-la-foret-en-plein-jour-avez-vous-peur/,KK,"Geneviève Castrée, the Québecois expat who records cobwebbed drone-folk as Woelv, and Phil Elvrum, the Microphones maestro whom Castrée moved to the States to marry, seem like a match made in heaven. Both are multimedia aficionados who conflate the natural world with lost innocence. Both tread a thin line between childlike wonder and childlike fear. And both make music that moves by feel through phases of power and delicacy. While Elvrum was already known as a musician when he began supplementing his music with lavishly illustrated books, Castrée was a well-regarded comics artist before she began releasing music to supplement her comics. Her works have been published by underground pacesetters like Drawn & Quarterly, and consist of either stylized storybook tableaux with saturated colors, or heavily shadowed dream worlds that suggest techniques of etching and intaglio. On Tout Seul dans la Forêt en Plein Jour, Avez-Vous Peur? (roughly: ""Alone in the forest in the middle of the day, are you scared?""), Castrée translates both of her primary artistic modes to music-- at times, the songs stand out bright and clear; at others, they dissolve into deep contrast. In the first half of ""Drapeau Blanc"", over a few tentatively picked acoustic guitar notes, Castrée's meandering voice suggests a French-speaking, double-tracked Joanna Newsom; the song floats like one limpid line. In the second half, the great blocky shapes of drums and elegiac whistles plunge this line into shadow, breaking its edges on sharp corners. If Castrée's striking voice and the album's wooly atmosphere are Woelv's strengths, then structural imbalance is its weakness. The song lengths are haphazard, ranging from 48 seconds to over 12 minutes, which might be an admirable example of form following function if one didn't often wish the short songs were longer and the long songs were shorter. ""La Fille Qui S'Est Enfermée dans La Salle de Bains"" is a wonderful madrigal, with three Castrées chirping in rococo harmony; would that it were longer than a minute, and that the nighttime field recordings closing out the title track were less than eight. Likewise, the circular guitar figure and vaguely Middle Eastern singing of ""(Réconciliation)"" scarcely have time to work their hypnotic magic before petering out. Nevertheless, any number of terrific moments wash by in the album's uneven flow, many of them evoking some subterranean disturbance: the muffled, distorted percussion that inserts latent menace into ""La Petite Cane Dans la Nappe de Pétrole"", the cymbals that knife their way through the rumbling piano of ""Au Viol!"", and the wowing drone the wends through the hand percussion of ""L'Homme Qui Vient de Marcher Sur une Mine"". These also reinforce the album's sense of a lost child's awe and terror-- in la forêt there are many amazing things to see and do, but there are also loups, padding concealed through the underbrush.","Working with her husband Phil Elvrum of the Microphones, the Québecois expat Geneviéve Castrée has constructed a murky lo-fi space that treads a thin line between childlike wonder and childlike fear, sometimes evoking the shadowy worlds she has created as a well-regarded comics artist.

Sensitive/Lethal,Thurston Moore,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbca5e6ef95969322cc6/1:1/w_160/ba55d837.jpeg,2008-07-17 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11959-sensitivelethal/,No Fun,"American fringe music boasts no figurehead as prominent or as potent as Thurston Moore: The multimedia mogul of independent rock, Moore still leads Sonic Youth after nearly three decades, runs a record label with worldwide distribution, writes poetry, reviews records in Arthur, scribes liner notes, recently co-authored a handsome hardback on the history of no wave, wrote trenchantly about Finnish hardcore last year for The Wire, and managed to narrate a straight-edge documentary for National Geographic. Oh, and if you have a guitar and a pedal around, he'd probably be super fucking stoked to do a little collabo later this afternoon. Indeed, even with big-time moves like a Sonic Youth compilation that's available only in Starbucks and a book with his name on it available in Border's, Moore's outsider foundations remain conscious, pronounced and, ultimately, very respected: During a photo shoot for Sonic Youth's recent Rather Ripped, Skinny T donned a Merzbow shirt. In lieu of liner notes for Sensitive/Lethal-- his noise debut for New York's excellent No Fun Productions imprint-- he penned a poem that closes, ""blessed are the noise musicians for they shall go down in history./ way. way. down."" And, unless you're really paying attention, Moore has probably released music on at least 10 labels you've never heard of, even though he's, like, legitimately famous. Maybe you caught that track he put on a 1997 vinyl-only compilation for Norway's Apartment Records, or maybe you dug Please Just Leave Me (My Paul Desmond), the 1996 one-track blazer for RRR imprint Pure? Moore does a lot, and he often offers small labels he likes-- like No Fun, Little Brother, Table of the Elements or Important, who released two albums of Moore's duo the Bark Haze last year-- his work mostly as limited-run, highly sellable gifts. While Geffen still gets Sonic Youth records and his own Ecstatic Peace got last year's song-oriented Trees Outside the Academy, Moore often hands upstarts something with his name on it mainly, it seems, so they can release more things he likes without his name on it. Of course, quantity and/or beneficence don't equal quality, and Sensitive/Lethal doesn't equal much else. Constituted of three tracks of very-precedented, long-form noise, Sensitive/Lethal is an entirely unfocused trip, a hodgepodge of techniques and sounds gleaned and recombined without much imagination or élan. Moore is painting by the numbers without much of a mind for the intermediate processes or the completed picture. The first track is a dense psychedelic wash that pits a harsh, zig-zagging electric din against a a steadily strummed acoustic. Static bombs, slow oscillations, and blurred high frequencies clip and chew at that core for much of the track's 22 minutes. Hear it better on the extended take of Sonic Youth's ""The Diamond Sea"" or any of a few hundred ""dense textural drone"" records, from Bardo Pond to Thuja. Track two sounds like an industrial or doom-metal version of Steve Reich's ""ultimate process piece,"" ""Pendulum Music (For Microphones, Amplifiers, Speakers, and Performers)"", which Sonic Youth already interpreted for its 1999 album, SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century. The best four minutes of Sensitive/Lethal's 60, the track is worth your time. But track three is a 26-minute guitar-and-pedal marathon, wrapping punishing high tones and broken waves of squall into and around one another. It's epically boring, a marathon for no one. Hear such sounds done better on Prurient's Black Vase or a dozen Yellow Swans records. Many of the best noise records create their own environment, a singular space of sound that runs like an hour of mimesis through a world you'd never imagined. C. Spencer Yeh does this as Burning Star Core, as does Mike Tamburo on 2006's expansive The Ghosts of Marumbey. Sensitive/Lethal-- an unstable structure of second-hand materials-- barely tries. This isn't the first stale experimental record from Moore, and no signs indicate it will be his last. No problem: If selling through the run of Sensitive/Lethal allows No Fun proprietor Carlos Giffoni to continue releasing groundbreakers like last year's tense-and-torturous Consumer Electronics LP Nobody's Ugly or this year's psychedelic coup, Resin by Religious Knives, so be it. Just let the Sonic Youth quasi-completists be the bros who snag it. Don't let it serve as a lens into what the best of noise in 2008 can be. At best, it lifts weakly from those he long ago inspired.","The latest in a long run of below-the-radar experimental solo releases for small labels finds the underground rock figurehead making long-form noise music for Carlos Giffoni's No Fun imprint.

Dirty Versions,We Versus the Shark,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe45e6ef95969322d10/1:1/w_160/e556a287.jpg,2008-07-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11980-dirty-versions/,Hello Sir,"We Versus the Shark never seem to want to do things the easy way. Their songs aren't so much played as they are choked within an inch of their life, twitching with unpredictable time signatures and knotty structures, filled with copious and complicated guitar work that exhausts both band and listener, and with vocals that are varying degrees of desperate. If genre tags are your thing, the band doesn't think spazz-rock is spazzy enough. Yet they've hovered close to moments of poignancy and relative quietude on the edges of their perpetual stampede, enough to imply that they might use their all their readily apparent ability towards more discernibly pop ends. Not this time, however: Dirty Versions was mostly recorded live over two days, and it pushes all those aforementioned proclivities as far as they'll go. It's a portrait of the band as they are, and it's more like a blurry Polaroid than a Sears family photo. ""Hello Blood"" begins at a sprint, with sudden stops and starts punctuated by frantic guitar soloing, but it falls into a brief moment of vocal harmony buoyed by the band stamping down a 4/4 rhythm in an unexpected jolt of melody. From there, it's all loopy guitar lines, distorted, galloping bass, and rhythms that brake for no one. By the time they take a breath with the slow, droning notes of keyboard that open the fifth track ""Dogs"", it seems like it was a race to get there. From there, Dirty Versions offers slightly different flavors of frantic, from the lurching ""I Am a Caffeinated Corpse"" and its burping keyboards to the chunky chords and thick paranoia of ""Gothic Y'all"", to trading licks over the bridge of ""Keep It Wolf"". Final track ""Practical Animals"" is no less dense, but it's a little more math-rock and, more importantly, moodier, as its circular, repetitive riffs become an eight-minute echo chamber of broken machinery and messages cut short, its weary and wistful mood poking through the mélange. While this record is teeming with ideas, there's something to said for executing just one really well, as they do on ""Hello Blood"", where the twitching and sputtering has something to play against. After the entirety of the album's wild ride, it might be that first track that lingers in the memory. The dense flurry might be more exhausting for the album's live-in-the-basement production, but it's mostly the band simply being itself, and pushing what worked before further. Maybe We Versus the Shark try too hard sometimes, but they're trying too hard to challenge themselves and find something that's their own. More bands should flail so valiantly.","Latest from this frenetic spazz-rock outfit from Athens, Ga., finds the band simply being itself and pushing further what worked before.

The Greatest Story Ever Told,David Banner,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0cc0084474cd0c29d1/1:1/w_160/b2c121e8.jpg,2008-07-17 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12012-the-greatest-story-ever-told/,Interscope,"David Banner is a complicated man, a onetime University of Maryland grad student and committed philanthropist whose two biggest hits (""Like a Pimp"" and ""Play"") are among the most proudly ignorant rap singles this decade. He raps with equal fervor about poverty-stricken inner-city struggle and really nasty sex, and he thinks nothing about placing entreaties to God right next to stark gun-clap threats. On Mississippi: The Album, his 2003 solo debut, those contradictions worked as strengths, as evidence that this guy was more than a garden-variety facepunch ranter. But on The Greatest Story Ever Told, Banner's fourth, those same complications turn the album into a complete mess, something that veers away from listenability perilously often. The difference: These days, Banner really wants to be a massive star. Given that his voice is a gravelly demonic rasp about as easy on the ears as a jackhammer outside your bedroom window, that's almost certainly not going to happen. But since the release of 2005's Certified, Banner's shed a gang of weight and started wearing designer t-shirts and sunglasses. He's also committed a ton of resources into making a blockbuster event out of The Greatest Story; Akon, Chris Brown, Snoop Dogg, Chamillionaire and Lil Wayne all stop by for cameos. But Banner was a more compelling pop musician when he wasn't so worried about capitulating to imagined mainstream concerns. These days, Banner's doing everything he can to capture a mainstream that basically doesn't exist anymore, and making some cringeworthy missteps along the way. When T.I. shows up on Story, it's not to kick a verse; it's to tell a long and rambling story about how real Banner is. And ""Shawty Say"", Banner's best shot at crossover success this time around, inexplicably samples the only part of Lil Wayne's ""Lollipop"" that radio can't play, the ""shawty says the nigga that she with ain't shit"" bit. Behind the inept pop moves, the old devil's-bargain sellout strategy looms: If Banner makes his record company happy by spending half his album desperately attempting to concoct hit singles, he can spend the other half telling truth to power. And so on album opener ""So Long"", he comes off like a big-budget Immortal Technique, demanding ""fifty shots for every cop who shot Sean Bell"" and calling his generation cowards for not fighting cops often enough, and he advances that same militancy all over Story. But those tracks succeed just as haphazardly as the pop songs. Nobody needs to hear ""Freedom"", Banner's attempt at a cappella slam-poetry, and on the messily pretty ""Cadillacs on 22s (Part 2)"", he clumsily sings the whole title, including the ""part two."" Banner's greatest assets are the hard plastic beats he produces; he is, after all, the guy who made ""Rubber Band Man"" for T.I. But the beats on Story never quite cohere, and tracks like ""Uncle Swac Interlude"", an endless phone conversation with Banner's drunk uncle, further interrupt the flow. And Banner's firebreathing wears thin, too. As a rapper, he's unfortunately short on both restraint and punchlines. He could use an editor, especially on songs like the fuck-jam ""A Girl"", where he digresses from his rough-sex talk to ask his ladyfriend ""Could you please come and sign this waiver?/ If you pass out, girl, you can't sue."" Sign a waiver? Also worth noting: The album's best line comes from one of the guests; Pimp C returns from the grave on ""Suicide Doors"" to inform us that his nuts got a MySpace page. Banner could use some of that batshit humor. It's hard not to sympathize with Banner, a truly likable figure who desperately wants to be both popular and important but who can't quite seem to make either thing happen. But if he keeps putting out scattershot albums like this one, he won't get any closer anytime soon.","On his fourth album, David Banner's strengths-- rapping with equal fervor about poverty-stricken inner-city struggle and nasty sex-- become complications that threaten to derail this wannabe event record.

Life...The Best Game in Town,Harvey Milk,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc045e6ef95969322d56/1:1/w_160/e6c2f1e1.jpeg,2008-07-17 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12005-lifethe-best-game-in-town/,Hydra Head,"Had the first incarnation of Athens, Ga. metal band Harvey Milk never released anything after its second record, 1994's Courtesy and Good Will Toward Men, the trio of Creston Spiers, Stephen Tanner, and Paul Trudeau could still claim two of the 90s most bizarre records. The group's sound was high cliffs and deep valleys, start/stop monoliths of feedback and distortion, subtle electronics, thunderous drums, and a vocalist who sang like he'd devoured Tom Waits' soul. In 1997, the trio made one hell of a musical left turn, churning out a relentless riff-rock record, The Pleaser. Harvey Milk had become a bruising bar-band, recording unyielding anthems with clenched fists and clear focus. Frontman Spiers still sounded menacing, but he now fronted a trio with a newfound melodic steel: ""We're having a rock'n'roll party/ I don't care what you been told/ It's too late to be too old/ Party!"" he sang on ""Rock & Roll Party Tonite"", sounding like Kurt Cobain fronting Cheap Trick. Though Harvey Milk 2.0 didn't care to replicate the enigmatic menace of its predecessor, they still sounded tough as rust. Luckily, Harvey Milk survived beyond those first three records, even if it took them several years to re-enter the studio following The Pleaser. After Trudeau left the band in 1996, Kyle Spence joined for a two-year run. But between 1998 and 2005, with their members scattered between two coasts, no one really heard from the band. Tanner split his time between Portland, Ore., and New York, and Spiers became a music teacher outside of Atlanta. Both drummers picked up work with less memorable acts. Slowly, though, history caught up with Harvey Milk: Longtime friend and fellow Athens expatriate Henry Owings (of Chunklet notoriety) compiled the band's impossible-to-find vinyl output into 2003's The Singles. The Kelly Sessions, released a year later, gathered alternate takes of material from those first two records. Even in death, Harvey Milk got a third chance. Mostly out of the blue, the band reformed with original drummer Trudeau, releasing 2006's Special Wishes, a half-there recapitulation of that early sonic mass and the rugged rock of The Pleaser. It was, at the least, promising, and enough to further Harvey Milk's intrigue. Then, last year, fates collided when skuzzy sonic master Joe Preston-- long of Thrones and formerly of Earth, Melvins, High on Fire, and Sunn 0)))-- joined. Spence again replaced Trudeau on drums, and the new quartet entered his Georgia studio to record the Hydra Head-issued Life...The Best Game in Town, the best executed Harvey Milk album to date, and one of the most accomplished metal records you'll hear this year. Appropriately, Life runs a bit like a Harvey Milk Greatest Hits: Most everything the band's ever done right-- from its ultra-dynamic, frighteningly agile early work to the Dixieland Motörhead maul of its later work-- falls into place here, the elements freshly recombined. Rendering tension through silence was an early Milk specialty, for instance, but they generally bisected sustained notes of long riffs, creating a sinister shroud of suspense that lifted slowly. But on ""We Destroy the Family"", a cover of a 1982 song by confrontational Los Angeles punks Fear, the band swipes the melody and matricidal lyrics only to rebuild the structure with bass quakes and a long pass of unexpected silence: After two minutes of pounding, things go deathly still. The five stillborn seconds feel like enough time to contemplate retirement plans and stock options. You'll jump when the band wrecks its reverie. ""Good Bye Blues"" staggers and stumbles through shifting rhythms, too, a panoply of unpredictable rests causing Spiers' slow growl, the guitars' long riffs, and Tanner's drums to slip past one another. The parts coalesce long enough to flirt with ZZ Top bombast before locking into a downbeat stomp. On ""Skull Socks & Rope Shoes"" Spiers sounds as pained as he did on those early maniacal masterpieces, except he's fortified now by a howling rock band. Playing bass here, Preston completes a turgid rhythm section, while the guitars crest and collapse in menacing waves. Though the core of Harvey Milk 3.0 sounds like a fully functional alloy of its predecessors, three tracks here establish this incarnation as a different act with distinct ideas: Epic opener ""Death Goes to the Winner"" twists lyrics from the Velvet Underground and the Beatles (""I'm Waiting for the Man"" becomes a taunt, ""A Day in the Life"" a suicidal threat) and immolates the guitar solo with pangs of feedback and a speaker-splitting drum throb. ""Roses"", written by Trudeau, shatters any respect for dynamics you might have. ""It becomes cigarette smoke/ It matters little/ Love is not so bad,"" Spiers sings over spare piano notes, his pockmarked croon gilded by harmonies and acoustic guitars. But in the end, it's the mid-album ""Motown"" that signals the stretch of this band's canvas. Though it carries the group's signature menace, the hummable song delivers a pop-metal precision that's as accurate with its riffs as it is patient with its delivery. Harvey Milk's soul and swagger-- long apparent but often stretched and overdriven-- come together clean at last, the perfect, unpredictable pinnacle for a marvelous maze of a career.","After a left turn, a seven-year break from the studio, and the addition of Joe Preston (Earth, Melvins, High on Fire), Harvey Milk make an unlikely comeback, crafting one of the year's most accomplished metal records.

The Beautiful Lie,Ed Harcourt,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe9ea9e61561daa7354/1:1/w_160/3e801b95.jpg,2008-07-16 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11985-the-beautiful-lie/,DovecoteDovecote,"Most people are probably unaware that you can go into a record store with about $20 and leave with an honest to god copy of Ed Harcourt's Greatest Hits. Truth-in-advertising watchdogs must have let it slip under their radar too: while the ""greatness"" of its contents is certainly up for debate, at least stateside, these songs' status as ""hits"" is far more cut and dry. Basically, if you can't remember that his 2001 debut, Here Be Monsters, came strapped with a Mercury Prize nomination and extremely generous Rufus Wainwright, Tom Waits, and Elliott Smith comparisons, odds are you saw this review and wondered when the host of ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"" started writing his own songs. Then again, the brio of an amateur would almost have to be preferably to the overzealous professionalism of Beautiful Lie, whose frilly ""classicist"" pop gets all dressed up to go absolutely nowhere. Obviously, I've got a well-worn copy of Night Falls Over Kortedala that can speak how great things can happen when sumptuous instrumentation meets a firm background in remembering. But where Jens Lekman uses the orchestra pit to sweeten the pot, heighten drama, or serve as counterpoint, Harcourt simply slops syrup over his bland compositions until it's the only thing you're able to taste. Is there really anything you can't get out of ""Good Friends Are Hard to Find"" or ""You Only Call When You're Drunk"" just from knowing its title? The unsurprising answer is ""no""-- particularly the former, when Harcourt's stone-faced lurch is only interrupted in its final minute, wherein he gets into an ugly shouting match of what's left of a melody. Meanwhile, ""The Last Cigarette"", though starting out with an arresting image of a soldier about to face his death, soon bullies the listener into submission with unbearably maudlin clips from Editors' ""Smokers Outside the Hospital Room"" (which it admittedly predated) and any number of Eel's more lugubrious musings from Electro-Shock Blues. At least that song waits to submerge the listener into its abject misery-- ""Rain on the Pretty Ones"" starts out with enough canned strings to send Windham Hill into sugar shock before rattling off the kind of lyrics that smack of college freshmen trying to outpity each other in a poetry seminar: ""I'm the hunter/ Killed by his dog/ I'm the statue/ Brought down to the land."" Harcourt usually allows himself one cheeky attempt at uptempo levity per record (see also ""Shanghai""), and here it's the vaguely political ""Scatterbraine"" (""how can someone so dumb still be on the run from the law?"") which throws every instrument he's able to play into a rank gumbo of mismatched New Orleans jazz. Even the most energetic hooks come in what Nigel Tufnel once called the saddest key (""Whirlwind in D Minor""), although that simply sounds like what might happen if Greg Gillis got his hands on some Ours and Guillemots records. Speaking of Girl Talk, Feed the Animals just might be the absolute inverse of Beautiful Lie. Both are pretty tough to handle for more than ten minutes at a time, but while Gillis' mashing of joy-buzzers leaves plenty of room for later reentry, Harcourt simply offers a steady IV of teardrop balladeering-- it's arguably the most challenging release of the year if only because Harcourt practically dares you to find a fluffy melody or non-dud lyric to latch onto over the span of its 50-plus minutes. Heck, it hardly even feels like an album so much as Harcourt sinking into the same tarpit graveyard that snatched so many other promising turn-of-the-millennium chamber-pop artists. Tell Damien Rice, Badly Drawn Boy, and Tom McRae we said ""hi.""","No, the host of ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"" hasn't started writing his own songs; it's the latest album from that dude who used to get compared to Elliott Smith and Rufus Wainwright but now gets bracketed with Tom McRae and Damien Rice.

Osborne,Osborne,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf213d197565213b1de/1:1/w_160/f315da11.jpg,2008-07-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11990-osborne/,Ghostly,"Detroit artist Osborne has a storied mechanical past that includes work on airplanes and even a proposal for a hovercraft, but little on his self-titled debut suggests the presence of a heady tinkerer who looks good in coveralls. That's not a knock. For one thing, he does look good in coveralls. For another, Osborne traffics in an immediate and simple brand of electronic music in which the finer points of ""sound,"" rather impressively, prove immaterial. What matters most to Osborne (who also operates much differently under his noisy breakbeat guise as Soundmurderer) is melody and mood, and they matter a lot. Nothing on his new album was conceived to go together in a cohesive fashion, which makes the disc a slapdash collection of different ideas and approaches more than an album per se. What pulls it all together (or at least keeps it all from spinning out of orbit) is a shared reverence for the most engaging and ""musical"" aspects of dance-music strains that don't necessarily need either to thrive. Osborne's sweet-spot is Chicago house circa the 1980s, the kind of clacking makeshift machine music that sounds like it was made with crumpled graph-paper and woodblocks drilled through with wires. But whereas followers might have expected Chicago simulations through and through (the first Osborne single, after all, was called ""Bout Ready to Jak""), Osborne fans out to take in lots of different sounds, most of them of aging vintage but none of them subjugated by the past. It's a tricky sleight-of-hand move that could probably only work on an album that skips around too much to even begin to settle on what sounds might signify outside the tracks they're meant to serve. ""Sound"" in that sense-- as a measure of style as well as a significant aural thing-- means less than whatever is happening to it. Which is worth keeping in mind during a track like ""16th Stage"": The album-opener starts almost aggressively unpromisingly, with a ho-hum beat and plinky notes from a keyboard seemingly set to mimic the hokey theme to ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" As it builds, however, the keyboard figure starts to reveal stirring little details made all the more emotive by newly introduced murmurs of voice, a splash of hi-hat, and subtle synth runs that go a long way in the service of harmony. What starts off as a vaguely embarrassing anachronism turns into a smart and rousing revelation in eight short minutes. Nothing else on the album ventures into sounds quite so hazardous as that ""Doogie"" synth, but Osborne's tracks all have a way of hiding surprise in seemingly generic or indistinct settings. ""Downtown"" mimics baggy rave house with a lot of restraint and poise, while ""Suffer"" courts chill-out rooms of yore with a melody more expansive and compelling than would be necessary for the cause. Osborne's intricate hooks and phrases play well at low and mid-tempo, but he's at his best when flinging ideas at charging dance tracks like ""L8"", which makes a rare legitimate claim for the kind of drama and sweep mastered by Chicago house legend Larry Heard (aka Mr. Fingers). Then comes ""Ruling"", an infectious snatch of splashy house that goes deep into disco with a soulful vocal sample and a bass-line so cool it sounds distracted and ready to do its duty only if it can find the time. (It does.) Osborne wanders too far afield at times, especially on the tribal banger ""Afrika"" and ""Our Definition of a Breakdown"", a would-be house-demonstration track with vocal announcements of what's coming before it comes. But even as it meanders out of shape, the album always manages to find weird and sneaky ways to snap back and then snap to.","A polymathic producer from Detroit (who also goes by the name Soundmurderer) cycles through dance music's past with a mind for the classic and the smooth.

Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson,Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe65e6ef95969322d17/1:1/w_160/3ad1da91.jpg,2008-07-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11982-miles-benjamin-anthony-robinson/,Say HeySay Hey,"Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson is one man, but his debut album is so full of voices and sounds it suggests the work of a community. Sometimes this fullness is just an illusion of multitracking and overdubbing, but often it's a document of something truly shared, thanks to contributions from TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone and various members of Grizzly Bear (the record was produced by GB's Chris Taylor). Nonetheless, it's still a solo album, which helps drive home the message these ragged singalongs seem to be suggesting-- that these people (and perhaps we too, by extension) are, in fact, lonely together. Much like Conor Oberst, Robinson may be surrounded by friends and their democratic noises, but his burdens are all his own.
 
The bands and artists already mentioned help provide some of Robinson's sonic signposts as well. The art-soul bleat of TVOTR is there, though MBAR steers more towards Dylan/Band loose-ended ramble than Bowie-styled museum pieces, putting him more in line with Oberst, Phosphorescent, and even the Arcade Fire (check the ecstatic wobbling of ""My Good Luck""). Robinson also isn't afraid to spray some sprawling, dissonant electric fretwork atop his compositions, particularly on ""The Ongoing Debate Concerning Present vs. Future"" and ""Woodfriend"", the latter lamentably deducted points for using the same melody as that one hit song Harvey Danger had. Probably the record's greatest fault is that Robinson abandons jaunty volume almost altogether as the album crawls to a close, and hence the final few tracks tend to bleed into one sluggish junkie hymn.
 
From a lyrical standpoint pretty much the entire album is in that vein (no pun intended), Robinson conjuring images of disheveled dreams, substance crutches, and urban hipster ennui regardless of whether he's accompanied by the amiably loping country grooves of ""Who's Laughing?"" or the slow mournful chords of ""Above the Sun"". Given his perpetual state of weariness, Robinson deserves credit for managing to be open-ended and allusive without slipping wholly into ephemerality, spotting his addled pleas for solace, faith and mental health with druggie bio details like ""tried to kick on Tuesday,"" ""I don't each much, mainly skin"" and ""got a bit screwed off this shit that we scored/ Ripped off this kid's parents and had to buy a bit more.""
 
Robinson's choir of the damned reaches its fever pitch on ""Written Over"", a desperate plea for redemption and second chances that gathers a host of rawly unfulfilled voices to shout its titular refrain. Yet the stark, solitary verses are infinitely more telling-- mumbling, quavering and half-choking on his words at times, it's Robinson alone who finds himself with ""my face in the dirt/ My ass in the sky.""","With help from TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone and various members of Grizzly Bear, the solo album from Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson is full of ragged sing-alongs, messy gallops, and the sonic signposts of his well-established musical friends.

The Old Days Feeling,Mirah,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf5c0084474cd0c2995/1:1/w_160/026c407b.jpg,2008-07-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11993-the-old-days-feeling/,Modern Radio,"Fans and critics have long struggled with favorite artists maturing, but Portland singer-songwriter Mirah has traced a mostly upward trajectory with all manner of aging-artist-things: increasingly assured vocals, more poetic and less overtly personal lyrics, moving the studio out of the bedroom, a remix album. The granddaddy of them all, 2007's Share This Place: Stories and Observations, was a publicly commissioned multimedia art project recorded with orchestral ensemble Spectratone International, single-handedly covering nearly 19 maturing stereotypes. The Old Days Feeling, then, is appropriately named: an odds and sods collection of obscure material that hews closest to the tumultuous, typically K Records sounds of her debut, You Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This. Of course, as anyone familiar with the debut knows, Mirah uses her bedroom for more than a studio, and her funny, brash, coffeehouse (no pejorative) sexuality is a theme throughout Old Days. Mirah's pillow/microphone talk isn't shockingly explicit so much as refreshingly direct: ""Hey how 'bout some of that lubrication?/ 'Cause this motor's getting ready for some fornication"" stands out during ""Dreamboat"", but feel free to apply your most ""That's what she said""-inspiring interpretations to lines like ""you're as big as Texas"" and ""take me out riding."" Mirah examines how sex changes relationships, so while the latter part of a line like ""what ever happened to the sweet young chick/ Who fell for the babe with the strap-on prick"" um, pricks ears, ""What happened?"" is the substantive sentiment. ""Lone Star"", though nominally about a large penis, sees Mirah willing to fall for anyone who ""drops his pants"" but then ""drops out of school."" Old Days also functions as a tour of Northwest indie rock. Phil Elvrum appears as a collaborator and recording partner throughout. Calvin Johnson lends his Dub Narcotic studio to several tracks and pens the gushing and thoughtful liner notes, despite Old Days release coming by way of Minneapolis' Modern Radio records. ""Slighted"", a swaying, horn-fed jaunt, originally appeared on the Microphones' Blood, features Elvrum, Karl Blau, and Jason Anderson, and ""Lonesome Sundown"" was written by Johnson and Built to Spill's Doug Martsch. It's a community comp, with songs originally appearing on albums like lovetapelove that return zero Google hits. As expected, Old Days by and large features less orchestration than even You Think It's Like This, but these aren't acoustic guitar demos: ""Location Temporary"" (when Mirah is not talking about sex she is often talking about spatial relationships) features stringy piano chords and buried cymbal work. On ""Heat Gets Hotter"", Mirah treats her voice with a quivering chorus effect and sings over a tissue-thin electronic beat, creating what could be a haphazard High Places single. The rattling percussion and affecting, overdubbed vocals of ""The Place"" suggest strange, collegiate psychedelics. ""Don't!"" is a near revelation and likely responsible Johnson tabbing the Ronettes in the liners: Mirah supplies both stridently confident, sassy lead vocals-- ""There's no-o-oo sense in breaking up with you/ But it's what I've gotta do""-- and got-her-back ""whoo-o-oo""'s. Old Days hardly feels comprehensive at just over 30 minutes, but they are 30 minutes of Mirah that disappeared quickly in the face of cleverly orchestrated left-field pop records like C'mon Miracle and Share This Place. Collaborations, compilation appearances, odd arrangements: Old Days features all the objective elements of useful rarities disc, but it's doubly valuable for reminding us of a Mirah that might've grown up too fast.","Portland singer-songwriter offers an odds and sods collection of obscure material that hews closest to the tumultuous, typically K Records sounds of her debut, You Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This.

Untitled,Nas,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc01c0084474cd0c29b1/1:1/w_160/083c6d6c.jpg,2008-07-16 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12002-untitled/,Def Jam,"I'd hate to confuse correlation with causation, but the 18 months since Hip Hop Is Dead have gone a long way towards proving Nas wrong. Graduation and Tha Carter III showed that challenging mainstream artists can still produce genuine Billboard blockbusters, the avant-garde has been well-represented by stellar releases by Dälek, Subtle, and El-P (amongst others), and Jay Electronica (producer of the astounding intro ""Queens Get the Money"") and Wale have emerged as exciting new voices with promising commercial prospects. Even Nas seems to have gotten the message this year, producing an excellent 21st-century record that balances political powder kegs, audacious Escobar floss raps, complementary beats, and genuine inspiration. Unfortunately, that record was the far superior DJ Green Lantern Presents: The Nigger Tape (whose songs are sadly underrepresented here), not Untitled. Not that it's going to matter. Whether Nas intended to actually follow through with his incendiary, original album title, he's been treating his own self-fulfilling martyrdom as the record's main goal. (See the claim on ""Hero"": ""Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce, and Billy Joel they can't sing what's in they soul/ So Untitled it is/ I never changed nothing."") Whatever the unfettered vision for the record, through masterful PR work, Nas has given ample reason for listeners to blame everyone but himself for his most cynical and arguably worst album yet. At least Nastradamus was up front about being a shitty crossover bid. The most frustrating thing is that this could have been a solid record. But now, how is Nas going to come off like he intended Untitled to be an unflinching look at race relations and yet somehow leave off the track he did with stic.man? Worse still, the righteous message of ""Association"" (strength through interaction with those who inspire you) is forsaken for the stilted, spoken-word ramblings of ""Testify"", in which Nas accuses white downloaders of being unwilling to ""ride"" with him for whatever reason. And what about the hallucinogenic ""Esco Let's Go"", where he fantasized about ""[writing] hood movies like Posse and Five Heartbeats"" while summoning Elizabeth Taylor for career advice? Instead, we get an elderly German rhyming ""knotty head"" with ""Nazi sled"" (""America""), ""Breathe"" and its boring consumption rhymes (""First I cop/ Then I yacht""-- do go on!), and the gutless ""Make the World Go Round"" in which Nas, Chris Brown, and Cool & Dre top even Fat Joe in terms of trend-hopping insincerity, toasting to ballers, gangstas, hustlas, and the very same ringtone rappers he was willing to throw under the bus just two years ago when it was convenient for his public image. On Untitled you get to decide whether you prefer Nas thoroughly exploring half-assed concepts or half-assedly exploring thorough concepts. Note the distinction: Either he's missing obvious targets or hitting ones not worth aiming at. Peep ""Sly Fox"", a concerted attempt to be the ""She Watch Channel Zero?!"" for conservative news zombies, right down to its steady guitar chug. The main difference is that ""Channel Zero"" risked alienation by confronting its target head on, whereas when it comes to preaching to the choir and picking easy fights, Nas has no problem being the Morgan Spurlock of this rap shit. Speaking of rhymin' for the sake of riddlin'-- ""The Fox has a Bushy tail/ And Bush tells lies and Fox trots, so I don't know what's real."" Which essentially means nothing. More successful is the Busta Rhymes-featuring ""Fried Chicken"", which might actually be the record's strongest cut, but it doesn't take the expected route of cultural subtext, instead working the blues trope of female/food personification. But immediately after, you get the perspective piece ""Project Roach"", and in case Nas' verses somehow went over your head, a Last Poet intones, ""Niggas is like roaches/ We're never gonna go away."" Just because you understand him, it don't mean that he's nice, and just to make sure you're even more confused once the record finally ends, he precedes the suspiciously fence-sitting Obama song (""Black President"") with ""We're Not Alone"", a cashed-bowl musing on extraterrestrial life. As anyone who has followed Nas in the past decade knows, you're not here for the beats. Though he's never been hesitant to enlist the trendiest producers, they're rarely inspired to step up their game; here, it's obvious what the difference is between second-rate Timbaland tracks and something from the new line of pop-savvy super-producers. Particularly in the first half, Untitled is turned into Vice City, where each hired gun coats their tracks with ugly layers of polyester drums, fluorescent synths, and aimless violence. You can distinctly hear Polow Da Don buying into his own hype on ""Hero"", ignoring Nas as a lead instrument and bombing out the mix with pinwheeling keyboard arpeggios and obtrusive unison bends. On previous listens, ""N.I.G.G.E.R. (The Slave and the Master)"" sounded like the record's centerpiece and DJ Toomp's honest approximation of the fat cat lounginess of American Gangster. But check its tinny string section and punchless snares back-to-back with ""Say Hello"", and Toomp's trying to make it rain with nickels. Though many view Illmatic as the gold standard for hip-hop albums, it's abundantly clear that Nas is better off doing anything but trying to recreate it. His best work of the past decade ironically goes against the very concept of traditional album-making (The Lost Tapes, The Nigger Tape). When caught up in the increasingly antiquated promotional cycle, Nas is more likely to rely on ugly manipulation of people who tend to care way more about his work than he apparently does, and accomplish the exact opposite of what he presumptively set out for-- see how Stillmatic took advantage of those who needed to believe that it had equal footing with The Blueprint (illustrated by The Source's hilariously opportunistic 5-mic rating). See how Hip-Hop Is Dead took advantage of people willing to believe that Nas had anything trenchant to say about a game that increasingly sounded like it didn't need him anymore. Thanks to about a half-hour's worth of music made nearly 15 years ago, Nas will never lack a following, and the press battles surrounding Untitled will keep his name hot enough so we can do the same thing all over again in 2010, when he announces the release of his new album, McCain Killa.","Nas has produced an excellent 21st-century record that balances political powderkegs, audacious Escobar floss raps, complementary beats, and honest-to-god inspiration-- too bad that record was his recent mixtape with DJ Green Lantern, not Untitled.

The Fox's Wedding / Rusalnaia,Sharron KrausRusalnaia,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbfa13d197565213b1ef/1:1/w_160/05aa652d.jpg,2008-07-15 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11997-the-foxs-wedding-rusalnaia/,Durtro,"Since the release of her 2002 debut album Beautiful Twisted, British singer and musician Sharron Kraus has firmly established herself as a genuine heiress to the UK folk ancestry of Shirley Collins, Lal Waterson, or Maddy Prior. As a solo artist and in collaboration with like-minded peers Fursaxa, Christian Kiefer, or Espers' Meg Baird and Helena Espvall, Kraus has displayed her comprehensive grasp of English and Appalachian folk traditions, performing with a sparkling clear voice that can sound as ancient and elemental as rain, stone, or soil. Last year, in addition to her myriad other projects, Kraus contributed a track to the massive UK folk compilation John Barleycorn Reborn, and her current work might be best described by what that collection referred to as ""Dark Britannica."" On her latest solo album The Fox's Wedding, and with the first album from Rusalnaia, her collaborative duo with Ex-Reverie's Gillian Chadwick, Kraus creates folk music that unabashedly evokes the ancient rites, traditions, and mysteries of pre-Christian England. Her music draws heavily upon the influence of such early music pioneers as David Munrow and his Early Music Consort of London, and so will likely put a portion of its audience immediately in mind of hobbits or BBC costume dramas. Throughout these two albums, however, Kraus and her cohorts are also able to keep themselves fixed in the present, leavening their folk traditions with a healthy working knowledge of past and current underground culture. With its vivid songcraft and rich instrumental textures, The Fox's Wedding is at once Kraus' most ambitious album to date and her most accessible. Tied intrinsically to the natural world and the rhythm of the seasons, the album represents a song cycle of sorts, following a course of doomed romance (naturally), loss and renewal through a full calendar year. Though all of the songs here are originals, they have the heft and feel of traditional material, particularly as Kraus fills her lyrics with allusions to English pagan folklore on ""Robin Is Dead"", ""Green Man"", and ""Harvest Moon"". A skilled multi-instrumentalist, Kraus is also accompanied on The Fox's Wedding by an inventive and varied array of strings, woodwinds, and assorted medieval instruments. This allows her to cover an impressive amount of ground, ranging from the simple Appalachian banjo strum of ""Would I"" to the elegant chamber music of ""In the Middle of the Summer"" with a deceptive ease. Yet any concern that these songs might just be mannered set pieces should be dispelled in one swoop on the opening ""Brigid"", which finds Kraus rising up from her genteel surroundings with an unearthly series of shrieks and whoops. It's not Diamanda Galas, exactly, but it is not as far off as one might initially expect. As a vocalist, Kraus is not as idiosyncratic as contemporaries Joanna Newsom or Josephine Foster, but her distinctive vocals are immediately recognizable. And as she proved on 2006's Leaves From Off the Tree, her album with Espers' Meg Baird and Helena Espvall, she comes naturally to close harmony singing, a trait that again serves her well with Gillian Chadwick in Rusalnaia. Produced by Espers' Greg Weeks, Rusalnaia is more electric and overtly indebted to standard psych-folk than Kraus' solo work, yet it finds Kraus and Chadwick forming a promising if rather tentative new partnership. Named after a form of mischievous water nymph, Rusalnaia's songs of pagan frolic do include the occasional eye-rolling flight of lyrical fantasy. (The self-titled track ""Rusalnaia"" in particular likely provides more details of fauns, saplings and wreath-making than most listeners will find useful.) But throughout the album Kraus and Chadwick can sound as though they have been raised since girlhood in the same enchanted meadow, and it can be a treat to hear them share and exchange verses on ""The Sailor and the Siren"" or the effervescent ""Dandelion Wine"". Weeks, in his typical fashion, finds the opportunity to interject a few discrete lines of acid guitar and proggy keyboards. The whole ceremony closes with ""Wild Summer"", a whirling dance which echoes the ecstatic pagan spirit of the traditional ""Sumer is Icumen In"" performed at the climax of The Wicker Man, as Kraus and company once again pay a affectionate homage to their multiple generations of folk ancestors.",,7.7,
Verbs,AU,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbddabf31b7dc7155bb0/1:1/w_160/4fb10a94.jpg,2008-07-15 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11974-verbs/,Agoo,"Here's another re-write of that old ""not that many people saw the Velvet Underground play but everyone who did started a band""-adage: A fair amount of people have seen Animal Collective play and lots of them bought five Halloween masks, three samplers, two drum machines, and started an art-rock collective. It's no fun to damn a group with ""X sounds like Y,"" but AC comparisons will dog Au the way White Stripes follow the Black Keys: a series of prevalent but not insurmountable similarities. For all the sonic elements-- trebly guitars, cacophonous vocal outbursts, trembling pianos-- they share with AC, it's important to note that Au are decidedly un-weird, not freaky: They are less a group of forest children re-inventing music than an orchestral rock band playing a lot louder and having a lot more fun than most of its peers. Ultimately the keystone influence for Au-- as hinted by a song from Au leader Luke Wyland's 2005 debut (as ""luc""), peaofthesea, ""Faith(LouieLouie)Enter""-- may be garage rock band the Kingsmen and their garbled syllabic nonsense. And while Wyland is decidedly the center of the Au universe, Verbs is a ""band"" album, distilling the efforts of Wyland, Jonathan Sielaff, and Mark Kaylor-- as well as contributions from fellow Portlanders and members of Yellow Swans and Parenthetical Girls. These additions are easy to spot-- guests stop by to play banjos and clarinets instead of ""sequencer"" or ""effects""; the weirdest instrument listed in the somewhat meticulous liners is an amplified accordion-- lending Verbs a transparency and heartiness that Au peers Akron/Family or Caribou sometimes lack. Verbs' best moments come off like a band camp jam gone artfully haywire. The long instrumental midsection of ""All Myself"" features a fluttering clarinet and budding trombone before a tapping cymbal adds firmness. ""The Waltz"" is also highlighted by a clarinet-- wailing, this time-- and the aforementioned accordion, which between them make for a surprisingly seamless swarm'n'drone. ""Summerheat"" begins with lazily cawing saws before sporadically erupting with percussion and ringing amplifiers. Wyland's clever, too: he follows the sunshine-big gospel choruses of ""All My Friends"" with the ape-cage percussion and barreling organ of ""Are Animals"". Wyland doesn't have a bad set of pipes, but he's more productive as a de facto orchestra director than as a proper tunesmith: his neck-straining leads the way during ""Summerheat"" and ""The Waltz"", ushering his pals in and out of the mix, guiding their rabble-rousing with his own see-sawing intensity. Only during Verbs' most ponderous and deliberate moments-- the quiet coda ""Sleep"", the late morning simmer of ""Two Seasons""-- does the album's vibrancy and bluster erode. Parts of Verbs feel deliberately uptempo and chirpy, but even at its most forced the album represents a win for Wyland, who has finally aimed his off-kilter psychedelia in a direction worth pursuing.","For all the Animal Collective comparisons they garner, Au are less a group that's re-inventing music than an orchestral rock band playing a lot louder and having a lot more fun than most of its peers.

Last 2 Walk,Three 6 Mafia,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc05c0084474cd0c29bd/1:1/w_160/17754cf2.jpg,2008-07-15 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12006-last-2-walk/,Columbia,"Jon Stewart steps to the mic, looks behind him, smiles to himself, pauses for a beat. Then: ""You know what? I think it just got a little easier out here for a pimp."" And a moment later: ""If you're keeping score at home, Martin Scorsese: zero. Three 6 Mafia: one."" In some ways, the Best Original Song Oscar that DJ Paul and Juicy J won a couple of years back might be the worst thing that ever happened to them. Once a mysterious, sprawling crew of psychedelic and bloodthirsty Memphis rappers, Three 6 entered the national consciousness in the most cartoonish of ways: their giddy and incomprehensible acceptance speech. Hard to remember now, but that Oscar came just a few months after their soul-drenched all-Tennessee posse cut ""Stay Fly"" brought them close to breaking through to the mainstream on their own terms. After that Oscar, the group's narrative became the story of goofy funny rapper guys who inexplicably won an Oscar, a story that the group themselves were fully complicit in. ""Adventures in Hollyhood"", their deeply embarrassing MTV reality show, was full of moments like the one where they got kicked out of their mansion after an underling pissed on Jennifer Love Hewitt's lawn. No matter how many terrifying gothic-thump beats they churned out for unheard Project Pat albums, it was tough to take Paul and Juicy seriously after that. Their record label sure didn't take them seriously. Last 2 Walk finally saw release in late June, after more than a year of delays; ""Doe Boy Fresh"" and ""Like Money"", their pretty great early singles, don't even show up on the final album. In fact, the thing might've only been allowed to see release because of ""Lolli Lolli (Pop That Body)"", the minor hit they finally scored. ""Lolli Lolli"" is a godawful abortion of a T-Pain ripoff, exactly the sort of synth-cheese trance-rap these guys should never, ever attempt. And they seem to know it, too; ""Lolli Lolli"" comes at the tail end of Last 2 Walk, after Paul and Juicy's customary drunk-shouting outro, basically relegating it to bonus-cut status. The rest of the album is the group's usual gleefully knuckleheaded fuck-you-up Memphis get-buck shit, essentially the sort of music these guys have been churning out for nearly 20 years. The few crossover attempts that do pierce the nihilistic fog on Last 2 Walk don't make much difference. The Akon and Lyfe Jennings collaborations certainly aren't good, but they never deviate much from the Three 6 aesthetic, and they don't blow the mood too badly. Even the deeply ill-advised Good Charlotte track somehow stays within Three 6's wheelhouse, even if it does completely suck. The vast majority of Last 2 Walk is Paul and Juicy ranting about drugs and blowjobs over beats that sound like John Carpenter soundtracks with elephant-stomp drums, which is exactly as it should be. The Memphis-vet posse cut ""First 48"" features forgotten local legends Al Kapone and DJ Spanish Fly making a good case for their relevance. ""On Some Chrome"" is deliciously eerie evilness, and it features the last verse Pimp C recorded before he died. This is what Paul and Juicy should be doing these days. But the Three 6 Mafia of 2008 doesn't look much like past incarnations. The collective's membership numbers once neared double digits, but now it's down to just Paul and Juicy, both of whom have charisma to burn but neither of whom is actually a good rapper. Of course, it's arguable that no member of the group has ever been a good rapper, though I'll happily rep for Gangsta Boo and Koopsta Knicca. But the riot of competing voices on older albums had its own propulsiveness, and it's just not as much fun to hear the same two voices for seventy minutes straight. The berserk sense of purpose that animated their older albums is all but gone.  Somewhere on the way to novelty-fame, Three 6 Mafia lost something, and these days they sound like they're just going through the motions.","After a shock Oscar win and a deeply embarrassing MTV reality show, it still took Last 2 Walk more than a year of delays to appear, even though most of it is essentially the same sort of music these guys have been churning out for nearly 20 years.

Just Look Them Straight in the Eye and Say...Poguemahone!!,The Pogues,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc025e6ef95969322d52/1:1/w_160/e029c526.jpg,2008-07-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12003-just-look-them-straight-in-the-eye-and-saypoguemahone/,Rhino,"The Pogues were an unlikely post-punk success: Irish artists from England who filtered rowdy punk and hard-drinking pub rock through Celtic traditions. The latter they treated as a birthright rather than a burden, not simply updating well-worn sounds but finding old ways to play new styles, which gives them a rough-and-tumble quality that tends to thwart most polished attempts to define their particular appeal. Today it seems difficult to imagine any group with a tin whistle becoming as big as the Pogues, especially without being derided as gimmicky or disrespectful-- accusations once regularly leveled at the band. They were anything but. There's a reverence in their irreverence, and respect in their range of styles and emotions: the boozily sentimental, the grandly cinematic, the snarlingly raucous, and the desperately personal. The Pogues played a barnstormer like ""The Sickbed of Cuchulainn"" as adeptly as a genuinely lovely and forlorn tune like ""A Pair of Brown Eyes"", but acted as though they refused to see the distinctions between them. Before and after their initial break-up in 1996 (they've reformed to tour since then), there have been several retrospectives of varying depth and quality attempting to convey the band's innovation and impact: one-disc surface skimmers like The Essential Pogues from 1991, which collect their biggest hits, and two-disc career sum-ups like The Ultimate Collection in 2005, which dig a bit deeper. Just Look Them Straight in the Eye and Say... Poguemahone!!-- Poguemahone, the band's original name, means ""Kiss my arse""-- is a very different creature. For starters, it's a 5xCD behemoth, making it the largest Pogues retrospective to date. No mere autobiography, it's a musical tome. Furthermore, rather than rehash the band's most well-known moments, this secret history of its tumultuous career scrapes together B-sides, extended singles, alternate takes, live tracks, covers, compilation cuts, pretty much everything they contributed to the Sid & Nancy soundtrack (used or unused), demos that were previously lost, demos that were never lost, demos that they might wish were lost-- in general, the musical detritus a band accumulates over three decades. This type of vault-cleaning release can be as flummoxing as it is revelatory. By their very nature, these tracks were at some point judged inferior to those that eventually made their way onto albums or singles. Most often, a release like this works better as a historical document than as a musical experience, filling in the gaps in the band's catalog and reminding you how great said band's studio albums are. Compiled by guitarist Philip Chevron, Poguemahone nods to this expectation. Or, as drummer Andrew Ranken scrawls in the liners: ""As for this monstrous pile of bullshit which was left on the cutting room floor, and probably should have been carefully incinerated, (or returned to its rightful owner), it just feels to me like the last squeeze of a desiccated teat that dangles from the shriveled udder of a mired to its knees in the bog skeletal cow unto which a foul cowman has been sent to milk. Jaysus!"" But the Pogues are better represented by a monstrous pile of cowshit than a shiny, carefully curated box set that politely considers their place in 1980s British rock, which is why Poguemahone is more satisfying than any of their glorified greatest hits. In fact, that might be the key to their long career and continued appeal, the very reason we're discussing them as a box-settable band rather than a one-off Stiff Records curiosity. They'd rather say ""kiss my ass"" than kiss yours, which means for Pogues enthusiasts, this box will be a fucking godsend, full of rare tracks that the most diehard will have heard and many more that will be completely new. Because the set covers the full breadth of their career, these five discs emphasize a constant rotation of singers and musicians (each line-up is listed separately in the liners) rather than focusing on their 1980s heyday. The lumbering, slurring Shane MacGowan is less of a presence here than expected. Even so, he's as unavoidable as the drunk in the doorway, and Poguemahone makes a convincing case for his talents as both a songwriter and as a singer. The live tracks from Rum Sodomy & the Lash, especially their energetic reading of ""Sally MacLennane"" show his mastery over a crowd, and his raucous take on ""Do You Believe in Magic?"", an outtake from the EP Poguetry in Motion, avoids the pisstake and constitutes a credible, even inspired cover. Kirsty MacColl, MacGowan's best vocal foil, gets several songs on these five discs, and her voice, as always, ranges from withering contempt to devastating heartbreak in the span of a single syllable. Next to them, the other Pogues singers-- Cait O'Riordan, Spider Stacy, and Jem Finer chief among them-- can sound a bit indistinctive. Perhaps the biggest disappointments are the live cuts with Joe Strummer, who served a brief tenure in the band in the 1990s. These live versions of ""London Calling"" and ""I Fought the Law"" sound like any other Clash cover band. Better are the two versions of Steve Earle's ""Johnny Come Lately""-- the studio take from his 1988 album Copperhead Road and a live cut with Stacy on vocals. ""Fairytale of New York"", the Pogues' holiday chestnut is included here three times. The 1986 demo features MacGowan, Elvis Costello on piano, and enough missed notes to suggest they're all making it up as they go along. The two from the following year show how the song developed over time, finally leading to the Steve Lillywhite version on If I Should Fall from Grace With God in 1988. Other best-of fodder, like ""A Pair of Brown Eyes"" and ""Turkish Song of the Damned"", are included in solid live cuts, and the 12"" single remix of ""If I Should Fall from Grace with God"" launches into an extensive jam that sounds like the Pogues are truly enjoying their disgrace. Such inclusions make Poguemahone a good introduction to the band, although newcomers are still strongly encouraged to pick up Rum Sodomy & the Lash. However, the best songs here are those from the darkest corners of their catalog, such as the delicate Peace & Love outtake ""The Mistlethrush"" and the raggedy instrumental demo ""Lust for Vomit"", which portray the band with all their compelling flaws intact. All in all, a monumental pile of cowshit in the best possible way.","Too often derided as gimmicky or boxed into an ethnic corner, the boozily sentimental and grandly cinematic post-punk band is celebrated on a 5xCD set of B-sides, extended singles, alternate takes, live tracks, covers, compilation cuts, and demos.

Ghost Rock,NOMO,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd2eb335119a49ecb16/1:1/w_160/fb0a1186.jpg,2008-07-15 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11966-ghost-rock/,Nomo,"When Nomo put out their first album back in 2004, they were still doing their own take on what was essentially someone else's thing, namely the music of the king of Afrobeat, Fela Kuti. On their second album, 2006's New Tones, they found a sound that was more their own, spiking Afrobeat horn arrangements with an array of homemade, electrified metal instruments. Now, their third album finds the Michigan collective moving further out, establishing itself as a true innovator with a style totally its own. The groove is still at the heart of the band's music, but it's a deeper, stranger pulse than they've worked before, and arrangements have shifted away from Afrobeat crunch to a spacier, more symphonic approach. Call it cosmic funk or electro-jazz or something similar, but you can't call it Afrobeat revivalism anymore. Where we've become accustomed to Elliot Bergman's compositions blasting in with a thundering horn theme, he holds out on us on Ghost Rock, opening the album with an entirely unexpected geyser of metal percussion and squelchy but warm synth. There is no true theme-- the horns mass underneath the keyboard lead like a swarm of angry bees, but the lid is kept on the hive. If it's not already clear by the time ""Brainwave"" shudders to a close, ""All the Stars"", which features a guest spot from Hamid Drake on percussion, makes it obvious that this band is in new territory. The song is mostly percussion, with a bass line and hazy horn theme snaking through it. The feel is similar to a gamelan orchestra, with multiple percussion instruments, many of them pitched, playing a series of interlocking patterns. Bergman's DIY electric likembe plucks out a phrase for the rest of the band to revolve around-- he's made quite a few of these likembes, displaying some of them in a joint exhibition with His Name Is Alive's Warren Defever, a close Nomo associate responsible for the band's production duties. The rest of the album drifts back into somewhat more familiar territory, but the metallic chatter of sawblade gamelans, thumb pianos, and big, long sticks covered in small cymbals (a hallmark of the band's live show) is a constant background for the horn themes, occasionally rising to the fore. Bergman's horn arrangements have grown more sophisticated, leaving behind some of Fela's old army-of-horns approach in favor of Charles Mingus' precarious balance of structure and freedom. In part, he gets away with this because he has such a compelling and unique rhythmic element to work with now-- the pieces aren't hurt by the lack of a massive, ear-rattling horn line. ""My Dear"" actually has one of those huge themes, but it melts into short solos and has to duke it out with an answering theme on the guitar-- the baritone sax solo is especially mind-melting. Nomo's third album is different from its predecessors, but not so different that fans won't be able to easily follow them on their latest left-turn. The result of the band's experimenting with rhythm, percussion, and amplification is an exciting, kinetic sound that takes a band that started out looking to the past and re-orients it firmly toward the future. There have been a lot of attempts to take funk into the cosmos, and this one succeeds using decidedly earthbound means: metal, electricity, and a willingness to use one's hands to make something that realizes a goal.","The groove is still essential to Michigan's Nomo on their third album, but it's a deeper, stranger pulse than they've worked before, as arrangements have shifted away from Afrobeat crunch to a spacier, more symphonic approach.

Morgan Freeman's Psychedelic Semen,Infinite Livez vs. Stade,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd6eb335119a49ecb20/1:1/w_160/94e1a93b.jpg,2008-07-14 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11970-morgan-freemans-psychedelic-semen/,Big Dada,"Well, there's the title of the record, right up there. I suppose that's a good starting point as any in attempting to go on about what this record means: pop culture icon reference; drug trip reference; skeet skeet skeet reference. I have seen some pretty ridiculous debris floating through the dadaist/edgy/postmodern memetic flood of absurdity that teenagers on messageboards and YouTube expel into the popular consciousness-- stuff which seems largely intended to straddle a line between ""joke"" and ""symptom of autism."" And maybe Infinite Livez (née Steven Henry) is another symptom of the mindset that revels in the idea of modern DIY culture as some sort of hallucinogenic, scatological catchphrase factory, even if he's a bit more elevated than the usual out-of-context ""Dragon Ball Z"" screencaps. Infinite Livez's music can be classified quick-and-dirty style as Kool Keith meets Captain Beefheart via the past 10 years of British post-hip-hop, and his sense of visual design looks like some kind of Luis Buñuel version of Yo Gabba Gabba. I've been listening to his music for a while now and I still find myself stuck, confoundingly enough, at the ""what the fuck is this"" stage-- and I don't even know if that WTF is horrified or awed. But that doesn't mean he's not a worthwhile listen in some way or another. His first two full-length CDs were 2004's Bush Meat, a smart, surrealist exercise in racial and sexual provocation (featured tracks: ""Spade Invaders""; ""White Wee Wee""; ""The Adventures of the Lactating Man""), and 2007's Art Brut Fe De Yoot, a somewhat more inscrutable and abstract record that marked his first album-length collaboration with Swiss avant-electronic duo Stade. Morgan Freeman's Psychedelic Semen continues Art Brut's abrasive, single-take electro/improv, shifting slightly back towards the b-boy Fluxus of Bush Meat-- a bit alienating and disturbing yet still kind of funny in a between-the-lines, laugh to avoid getting scared kinda way. None of the conceptual humor is as straightforwardly laid out as Bush Meat's paeans to faux-Chris Ofili elephant-dung art and semi-comic body horror-- in fact, most of the ""jokes"" themselves fall by the wayside here in favor of a creeping discomfort hidden behind surface whimsy. The funniest track on this album is ""I Was a Saddam Body Double Pt. 2"", and that's mostly because Livez spends most of its length doing a dead-on imitation of Elmo speaking in tongues. Lyrics tend to skew towards impenetrable strings of non-sequiturs and thematically slippery free associations that ditch you right when you think you've gotten on their trail. Stade's production does a lot to forward the uncomfortable side of the album's equation, starting with the chortly drunk-hop of ""Hoxton Smoothie"" and the suspiciously straightforward groove of ""Man Machine""'s 1980s funk melancholia before moving into itchier turf. Much of the album wobbles on shaky-kneed midtempo hip-hop rhythms that feel like head nods gone dizzy, and trying to get a grip on the wheres and what fors of its construction will probably leave you lost-- there's gagging Moog synths, clapped-out breaks, and an overall sense that everything's held together with bloody gauze and rusty staples and all kinds of infection-causing nastiness. Henry's voice is what justifies all that, or at least justifies it when it works: ""Man Machine"" intercuts throaty r&b-style singing with raspy, genuinely creepy wails and gradually merges the two, ""Slack Babbath"" is a harrowing vocal duet with Joy Frempong that sounds like eagles fighting, and his flat but sinister invocations on ""Public Ultra Image Magnetic"" sound just like that title implies-- Critical Beatdown meshed gruesomely with Metal Box. Yeah, that album title's saucy enough, but its feel is more accurately laid out in one mid-album track, a stoned stagger crammed into a bassbin filled with sinister metallic laughter and agonized screams and lyrics spinning in fifteen hostile directions. It's called ""LOL to the Depths of Hell"". It should've been the title track.","Infinite Livez's music can be classified as Kool Keith meets Captain Beefheart, and it can be read as another symptom of the mindset that revels in the idea of modern DIY culture as some sort of hallucinogenic, scatological catchphrase factory.

The Dusk Line EP,Sian Alice Group,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd3eb335119a49ecb18/1:1/w_160/ee919ff5.jpg,2008-07-14 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11967-the-dusk-line-ep/,Social Registry,"The Dusk Line consists of four songs recorded at the same sessions as the ones that produced 59:59-- Sian Alice Group's debut LP. These tracks don't quite fit into the full-length's sonic scope, and on their own they constitute something of an enigma. They feature just vocalist Sian Ahern and Rupert Clervaux, who only plays the grand piano here. These songs aren't as full-bodied as those on 59:59; the minimalism of The Dusk Line-- both in its sparse instrumentation and its fascination with patterns and repetition-- suggests an unexpected quasi-classical base to the band's music. Earlier this year, in an interview with Anthem magazine attributed to the band as a whole, one member stated, ""There's more power in quiet/loud/quiet than just LOUD LOUD LOUD."" They demonstrated that application of the Pixies Principle on their two-thirds quiet debut LP. The Dusk Line EP shows that, along with dynamic shifts, the development of a song is something that's best demonstrated through repetition: The goal here is to draw out the hypnotic, subtle power of a single melody, a technique that aligns Sian Alice more closely with contemporary classical composers or the American minimalists of the 1960s than the shoegazers with whom they're often compared. ""October's Piano"" could be called ""October's Rain""-- it begins with tinkling, dancing notes before it folds into the EP's two-handed trick: one hand repeats and paces on a rhythm, while the other hunts out melodies, giving the sensation of repetition and variation all at once. In fact ""Days Of Grace III"" appears on 59:59, as does ""When..."". Do these versions feel particularly connected? Not really. ""Days III"" has a ticking energy, part from its rhythm section, part from the chirping birds sampled in the background. Dusk Line's ""Days Of Grace II"" uses Ahern's long syllables to give the slow, rhythmic feeling of a bellows pumping. Ahern's voice also, in a sense, replaces the strings on 59:59's ""When..."". It takes a second to realize that her ""ohhhs"" on ""When...(Variation)"" isn't some otherworldly instrument. She adds in wordless sighs that trace one side of the piano melody, while the other side dances over a few patterns. Each song could almost blend into the next, such as when the title track's feline grace slinks into the respiratory repetitions of ""Days Of Grace II"". The record's brevity saves it from becoming a slog, then, as the combination of repetition and modulation starts to flatten out as it progresses. Were Sian Alice a more established band, this EP would be a ""fans only"" affair, not because it's bad or indulgent, but because it's stripped to the marrow, showing what Sian Alice would be without the horns and granite basslines. Without the context of 59:59, The Dusk Line becomes a kind of found object, fascinating for everything it doesn't disclose, but frustrating in its arbitrariness.

Sick to Death,Eat Skull,by: Mike McGonigal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd4c0084474cd0c294e/1:1/w_160/fa7fdc04.jpg,2008-07-14 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11968-sick-to-death/,Siltbreeze,"On their first album Sick to Death, the Portland, Ore., band Eat Skull mashes together almost everything that's great about trashy art-punk, weirdo fuzz-garage, skuzzy punk-pop, Kiwi garage-rock and off-kilter bedroom-strum. If you adore the weird songs on the Not So Quiet on the Western Front album as well as the Urinals, Raincoats, Gordons, Swell Maps, Homosexuals, Tronics, Desperate Bicycles, Television Personalities, Axemen, Guided by Voices, Chain Gang, those Messthetics comps, and very early Pavement, then meet your new favorite band. You should know, though, that this record sounds like it was mastered by a deaf person. It's all super-distorted and in the red; even the ""folksy"" numbers are louder than fuck. But once your ears adjust, you realize that it's all killer, no filler. Lots of acts are mining similar territory these days. To name the most obvious adherents, Sic Alps, Times New Viking, Psychedelic Horseshit, No Age, and Tyvek have each hit upon their own twisted formula for reinventing noisy art-pop. For some reason, all these groups have decided that the best way to record is if all your songs sound like they were taped on a thrift-store answering machine using its built-in condenser mic, in a tiled bathroom, when you're really high. Was there some sort of convention held where it was decided this is how records are supposed to sound now? Does Tom Lax of Siltbreeze have nude photos he'll release of all these band people if they ever set foot inside a proper studio? And who came up with the ""shitcore""/ ""shitgaze"" term for this stuff? That's the silliest thing I've ever heard. I personally wouldn't mind being able to hear more of what's going on in some of these songs-- ironically, you can catch the distinct parts of the music way better when you go see these bands live. Arguing against this approach is useless, and if I do it any more I'll turn into Andy Rooney. You might as well walk up to your favorite Scandinavian death metal act and asking them to please write paeans to puppy dogs. Some things are just genre conventions, and you deal: in this corner you get songs about burning churches, and in the other you have more distortion and hiss than Slay Tracks. You'll notice I have not yet used the phrase ""lo-fi"" in this review. That's because I greatly dislike that term. In its 1980s/90s heyday, ""lo-fi"" referred to such a wide variety of acts-- Daniel Johnston, Dead C, Sebadoh, Supreme Dicks, Grifters-- that it was functionally useless right from the start. At most, ""lo-fi"" defines an alleged method of capturing sound, similar to the way that ""indie rock"" refers to a supposed distribution method and nothing else (aside from ""rock""). I am reminded of Jean Dubuffet's quote, that ""there is no art of the insane any more than there is an art of dyspeptics, or an art of people with knee complaints."" Um, but I digress. Unlike the current army of Anglophiles rocking the basements across the land, this quartet is as in love with American punk as they are the Commonwealth stuff. They shamble into a muffled memory of U.S. hardcore on songs like the Nervous Gender-ific ""Beach Brains"" or the wonderfully incomprehensible ""Stress Crazy"". But there's a surprising amount of variation between sounds and songs on Sick to Death; at times it seems like a various artists comp rather than one band. Here they are channeling GBV and the TVPs on the acoustic lament ""New Confinement"", while ""Puker Corpse"" is what the Gun Club would have sounded like if they only made soundtracks to haunted houses. The organ-driven shoutalong ""Punk Trips"" is a glorious pop song that pits multiple melodic hooks against one another, each of them competing for your heart. I dare you to not get it stuck in your head for days.","By subjecting their trashy art-punk/fuzz-garage songs to cheap, trebly, hyper-distorted production, this Portland band sounds right at home on the Siltbreeze label.

Oh What a Lovely Tour!,Babyshambles,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc03abf31b7dc7155c10/1:1/w_160/38da012b.jpg,2008-07-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12004-oh-what-a-lovely-tour/,Parlophone,"Most Americans aware of Pete Doherty know him as an un-engaging British tabloid staple, a wide-eyed kid with a drug problem and a penchant for bowler hats. In 2003, when Doherty was temporarily banned from performing with his first group, the Libertines, he instigated a side project, presumably as a kind of spirited flip-off to his former bandmates. Babyshambles, like any band with an (aggressively non-recovering, frequently incarcerated) addict at its heart, has been a contentious and inconsistent ensemble from its inception, releasing a handful of EPs and two shaky full-lengths. Oh What a Lovely Tour! was recorded at the SECC Glasgow arena in December 2007 (the CD comes with an accompanying DVD that includes five music videos), and given a few pending legal battles, might be fans' (especially those not based somewhere in the UK) last or only shot at experiencing Babyshambles live, at least for awhile. Accordingly, the release feels a little bit like an apology, or, more accurately, a distraction. Still, if you can get beyond Doherty's nonstop adolescent posturing-- ""It's not easy getting out of bed, it's not easy getting out of my head,"" he whines earnestly in opener ""Carry On Up the Morning"", from 2007's Shotter's Nation-- Oh What a Lovely Tour! sees Doherty keeping it together remarkably well, capably parading through a 75-minute set. Too bad 29-year-olds don't get green ribbons for participation: Doherty may be (sort of?) sober onstage, but that doesn't mean he's a compelling presence, and Oh What a Lovely Tour! vacillates between boring and inspired. Like any band that exists, constantly, on the verge of dissolution, Babyshambles are most focused on survival, and (understandably, maybe) less concerned with prodding the boundaries of early 2000s guitar-rock-- meaning even now, their songs sound oddly dated and formulaic, all jangly, vaguely punk-inspired retro-rock with depressingly few creative tweaks. Given his dedicated practice of smoking things, it's surprising that Doherty's voice isn't more textured; here, his pipes are clear and flat, and while he sings with determination, his vocals are lackluster and insistently bland. There are a few exceptions: ""Fuck Forever"", which closes the disc, contains the kind of woozy desperation that used to make Doherty a gripping frontman (the crowd spiritedly chirping along to the opening guitar chords doesn't hurt), with Doherty mewling and slurring like his tongue doesn't fit in his mouth. When he spits ""I'm so clever!"" it's hard not to hear the self-loathing dripping from his voice. ""It's not the same, it's not supposed to be the same,"" he insists. ""Lost Art of Murder"" (""Stop smoking that, you could change your life, boy,"" Doherty mutters, still insufferably self-aware) melts-- oh so ironically-- into a downtrodden rendition of ""The Good Old Days"" from the Libertines' 2002 debut Up the Bracket; ""Beg, Steal or Borrow"" is similarly dreary, although Doherty's bandmates compensate the best they can. Oh What a Lovely Tour! feels more like a deliberate message-- we can do this!-- than a self-sustaining piece of art. ""I never thought we'd make it,"" Doherty admits at the end of ""Delivery"". Unfortunately for him, showing up isn't always enough.","It's a live album from Pete Doherty's Babyshambles, a contentious and inconsistent ensemble with a handful of EPs and two shaky full-lengths under its belt. The CD comes with an accompanying DVD that includes five music videos.

Stay Positive,The Hold Steady,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbec13d197565213b1cf/1:1/w_160/ca53ba02.jpg,2008-07-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11987-stay-positive/,Vagrant,"The Hold Steady weren't the likeliest candidates for success. Pulling together after the demise of the imaginative, verbose, and mostly overlooked indie act Lifter Puller, Craig Finn relocated to New York to start a new band. Holding to his distinctive poet-lost-at-karaoke delivery, Finn-- like the Replacements and Hüsker Dü before him-- began unashamedly mining classic rock radio for inspiration. Surprisingly, it's the latter group you can hear on opening track ""Constructive Summer"", and not just in its title's resemblance to one of Hüsker Dü's most celebrated songs. One of the Hold Steady's most direct and thrilling tracks, ""Constructive Summer""'s tempo and edge are borrowed from punk artists like Iggy Pop, Joe Strummer, and Finn's friends in Dillinger Four (in a lyrical reference that will reward all the close Hold Steady readers out there). Here, the Hold Steady retain the successful balance struck by Boys and Girls in America, with Finn again avoiding crowding the band as it continues to grow musically: the ballads are weepier, the rock songs more immediate, the attempts to diversify more striking. While they continue to prove themselves a more convincing classic rock act than should be possible in 2008, there's a tension in this album's lyrics between old-fashioned storytelling and breaking down the fourth wall. Stay Positive is their mostly successful bid to have it both ways. Stay Positive also returns to the narrative threads that marked 2005's Separation Sunday and Finn's work in Lifter Puller, with murder and mayhem creeping back into the lyrical picture. The polite horn interjections and laid-back blooze licks of ""Sequestered in Memphis"" are musically joyous, though lyrically the narrator sounds inconvenienced to tell his story-- then hints before the chorus that he's retelling it in a station-house interview, as if he only returns to the chorus a second time at the behest of an interrogator. On one of the band's more ambitious musical diversions, ""One for the Cutters"", the guitars follow the lead of (no joke) a harpsichord while Finn relates the tale of a college girl who gets high a little too often and starts to party with townies-- no new subject matter there, until she finds out the difference between them and her freshman hookups is a proclivity to stab people. Songs like ""Navy Sheets"" or ""Lord, I'm Discouraged"" are mostly notable for adding new elements to the band's palette, be it new-wave keyboards or uncanny Slash-worthy solos, respectively. Meanwhile, ""Both Crosses"" adds busy acoustics (with J Mascis on banjo, no less), organ, and whispers of theremin to wrap murky atmosphere around one of the record's central mysteries: The girl haunted by visions of the future (referenced and romanced in the song before, ""Yeah Sapphire"") overdoes the self-medication for her condition and talks about seeing two crucifixions, one being Jesus Christ. The narrator gets understandably nervous over who will be the second. Stay Positive's other stories are a little less heavy: The band stretches its comfort zone on tracks like ""Joke About Jamaica"", adding a little talk-box while nodding to Zeppelin and offering sympathy to girls snubbed by music snobs in its lyrics. ""Drive-By Truckers frontman Patterson Hood shows up to sing a bit on ""Navy Sheets"" and Lucero's Ben Nichols croaks some call-and-response on the chorus of ""Magazines"", but somehow seems lost. Even as the band grows out of its quirks, its universe seems too impermeable yet to accommodate just any guest vocalist, whether the collaboration looks completely natural on paper or not. Every Hold Steady record heeds the importance of a killer closing track, but even so, ""Slapped Actress"" is something special. The band navigates one of its trickier compositions here, with churning, dirge-like guitar chords and a restrained piano performance that complements the song's changes in tone. As his protagonists beat a hasty retreat (to where else but Ybor City again), Finn manages to tie up the lyrical seeds he's planted on the record, and more: In an allusion to John Cassavetes' Opening Night, Finn nods to the fact that being in a touring band can be drudgery (""some nights it's just entertainment, and some other nights it's work""), but finds some new metaphors and new inspiration with Jumbotron-ready lines (""We are the theater,"" ""we make our own movies"") that acknowledge these songs belong to the listeners as much as the band. While its title and lyrics often make Stay Positive sound like a darkest-before-the-dawn kind of record, the themes Finn keeps returning to-- skipping town, starting over clean, resurrection-- all speak to the redemptive power of second chances. When the Hold Steady plead with you to ""stay positive,"" and you consider their unlikely and continued ascendancy, you could do worse than take them at their word.","The Hold Steady continue to prove themselves a more convincing classic-rock act than should be possible in 2008, creating a tension between old-fashioned storytelling and self-referential art.

Time:Line,Nicolay & Kay,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb4c0084474cd0c290a/1:1/w_160/b37bdfef.jpg,2008-07-11 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11944-timeline/,Nicolay Music,"I realize that discussing a hip-hop album through the framework of Norwegian film is the sort of thing that makes music critics so unfailingly popular at parties, but with Time:Line, I just can't help myself. More than any musical event, this record reminds me of a scene from the recently released Reprise: In the movie, seeking CPR for a flatlining relationship, a near-catatonically depressed author tries to replicate minute-by-minute a trip to Paris with his girlfriend that found the two at their happiest-- unsurprisingly, it becomes a sad run through the motions that only illustrates more vividly that the magic's gone. If you've followed Dutch producer Nicolay (currently based in North Carolina) with any sort of interest, you see where I'm going with this. He introduced himself as part of Foreign Exchange on 2004's Connected, a collaboration with rapper Phonte of Little Brother that was so flush with natural warmth and humanity that not even Joe Scudda could fuck up the good vibes. While Nicolay's been active to a certain extent since then, an admirable desire to avoid repetition has led to mixed results (to be fair, the same could be said for Little Brother), which is why Time:Line is likely to raise eyebrows in concept alone. Once again, he's done a record completely over the internet by offering up heaping cups of latte-rap froth to an MC that's more southern in locality (Houston to be exact) than mentality. But while Connected is a tough standard for anyone to meet, by trying to revisit it, Nic and Kay only make it easier to figure out what goes wrong where the precedent went right. At the very least, Nicolay's become a more skilled and versatile producer over the years, even if he's slowly but surely eddying away from what can be considered a hip-hop mindset. If there was any criticism that could be lobbed his way before, it was in how his sun-smeared soul samples tended to bleed into each other, but Time:Line aims for the headphones with tracks that are more overt with their details. Nicolay's clearly pushing his game into a higher tax bracket-- the intro jacks a jumpy double-time juke in search of those Gnarls Barkley dollars (or, to a lesser extent, ""Body Baby""), while ""Through The Wind"" is a dead-on approximation of Hall & Oates' stair-step electric piano. ""The Gunshot"" even manages to latch a spaghetti western riff to dancehall scatting (Rasta/Pasta?) without being too showy or mismatched. It's all expertly stitched together with a continuous flow, and as an instrumental showcase, it's proof enough that Nicolay could have a bright future as a Soulquarian. But here, we see more of a mismatch than a true partnership like Connected, where Nicolay's occasional soft spot for cheese mellowed the tannins in Phonte's sour grapes. Here, the duo tries to act like they're saving hip-hop from itself by offering up tracks that wouldn't raise an eyebrow on a Joe or Donnell Jones LP. Befitting someone who vocally resembles fellow good sport Consequence, Kay just sounds happy to be riding out the quiet storm, which unfortunately is at its worst when it tries to remind you of everything you're trying to forget about ""conscious rap""-- as the hook in ""What We Live"" obnoxiously puts it, these guys are bringing ""the real with no bling to match."" Yes, I realize the hornet's nest I'm sticking my hand into, particularly with how this site often suffers accusations of being covert PR ops for any number of ""socially irresponsible"" MCs. But Time:Line often stumbles for the same reason a Rick Ross record does: if you're going to work with the same old tired subjects, at the very least, don't fall back on the same old satisfactory signifiers. Kay's no amateur, but due to a lack of memorable wordplay or stories (as a term for drunkenness, ""tight eyes"" gets stashed into the ""bong bong""/""boughetto"" school of failed catchphrases), sometimes it's hard to hear something other than the two picking low-hanging fruit. As Kay intones ""Sometimes us artists, entertainers, get blinded by the lights, and we lose sight of what's real"" on ""The Lights"", it's abundantly clear that he's wielding a blowtorch and it's strawman season. Nearly Bible-thumping in its tsk-tsking, Kay talks down rappers selling millions of records, mistreating their queens and, unable to respond to the pressure, their ""best friend's name is coke and [they] put 'em up their nose."" Never mind whether it's based on actual experience-- in 2008, it hardly feels based in reality. Likewise, it's hard to be totally against what ""Through The Wind"" offers-- shit, if most of us want to relate to more hip-hop on a non-allegorical level, it's probably in our interests to get more tracks about ""catching independent flicks as the sun goes down."" But why do they always need to be over soft-batch drum taps and overly obtrusive rap&b dudes? Did RZA make ""All I Need"" any less resonant with his dank chamber production? And of course, the package wouldn't be complete without its jumbled, political-via-spiritual summation speech, here called ""I've Seen Rivers"", because Kay wants his words to flow like, well, you get the picture. Which isn't to say that Time:Line is a bad record, just one with an unsteady aim. Too often, it tries to get by on what it's opposed to instead of what it stands for, a gambit with little margin for error if you don't have a viably exciting alternative, or enough trust in the taste of the listener. Thanks to the crumbling infrastructure of major label hip-hop, there aren't many walls left-- Lupe Fiasco sounded great on Bun B's ""Swang On Em"" and Wale's Mixtape About Nothing seamlessly incorporated the Roots, Lil Wayne, and Elaine Benes. Time:Line is at its best when it's about putting hands in the air instead of pointing fingers-- ""Blizzard"" is a charming look back at Midwestern youth and ""Tight Eyes"" is a good-humored ode to substance abuse (""Drinks is free before ten/ But I'm a ghetto nigga so I'm a-drink before I get in""). These moments are sadly rare, and while Time:Line sounds as breezy as a day at the beach, Nicolay and Kay unfortunately spend too much of their time drawing lines in the sand.","Netherlands-born producer Nicolay, known in part for Connected, his winning 2004 collaboration with rapper Phonte, hooks up for a full-length with Houston-based rapper Kay of the Foundation.

Imperial Wax Solvent,The Fall,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd1ea9e61561daa7318/1:1/w_160/8d849a47.jpg,2008-07-11 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11965-imperial-wax-solvent/,Castle,"Mark E. Smith has been waiting his whole life to write ""50 Year Old Man"". It's the song he was born to sing, the song for which he's essentially spent an entire career spanning somewhere in the neighborhood of 26 studio albums rehearsing. Oh, he's written better songs-- loads of them-- but that's beside the point. This song, all 12 minutes of it, including the completely unexpected banjo solo, is basically Smith saying, ""I'm old and I'm still playing in this warped, badass band making challenging music and fuck you if you think I'm going to stop."" Never mind that 50 is hardly old these days, it's still glorious to hear him yelling, ""I'm a 50-year-old man/ What're you gonna do about it."" I expected him to tell younger bands to get off his lawn any minute. Smith is backed on Imperial Wax Solvent by yet another line-up of the Fall-- the mostly American band that chipped in on last year's underwhelming Reformation Post TLC (the TLC stood for Traitors, Liars, Cunts, according to Smith) is out, replaced by a bunch of Brits who can really thrash in the best Fall tradition. That's what this band has become at this point-- it's more a tradition than a particular sound, and whoever steps in to fill the shoes of the last guys to leave gets to put his or her own spin on it. Smith's wife Eleni Poulou is still at the keyboards (she takes a lead vocal turn as well, on the twitchy ""I've Been Duped"", where the others chant behind her like cheering football supporters), and bassist Dave Spurr stays onboard, joined by new recruits Peter Greenway on guitar and Keiron Melling on drums. Spurr is well-warmed to his role in the band now, and his weird, slippery bassline is the lead instrument on spooky opener ""Alton Towers"". It's a strange opener in that it's so subtle, but it's also quite effective as a lead track, drawing you in for the kill that ""Wolf Kidult Man"" delivers with its blistering guitar attack. Smith's vocals sound as slurred and irritated as ever, but he's clearly feeling refreshed after his American adventure (his musicians walked out on him and Poulou while they slept, forcing him to recruit the aforementioned Americans mid-tour), and he even has something of a foil on ""Can Can Summer"", as Poulou calmly inserts her own underplayed encouragement behind his declamatory spiel. The band supplies him with a handful of nice, evil riffs to work off of-- ""Tommy Shooter"" and ""Taurig"" are fantastic post-apocalyptic electro-punk and the punk-prog blast of ""Is This New"" seems designed to ""reduce your knees to noodles,"" to borrow one of Smith's own lines from ""Tommy Shooter"". While Imperial Wax Solvent has all the buzzy, crunchy sonic hallmarks of great Fall, it also doesn't quite rank with their highest highs, an admittedly tall order when that includes albums recorded twenty-five years ago by a completely different set of musicians. There are basically three quality tiers in the band's discography: classic Fall, good Fall and lost-the-plot-for-a-minute Fall, and this lands neatly in the second category, with none of the instant classic, teeth-cracking tracks that cover their best sides, but plenty of inspired ranting and rhythmic dexterity nonetheless. If nothing else, it makes clear that Smith is determined to keep charging into the new century at the helm of the Fall, and that can only be a good thing. I look forward to hearing ""70 Year Old Man"".","Now 50-- and writing an awesome song about it to boot-- Mark E. Smith and his latest collection of bandmates reprise all the buzzy, crunchy sonic hallmarks of great Fall on the band's latest album.

Mega Breakfast,The Chap,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b66bb1335d7bf169aa6a/1:1/w_160/a6c0128f.jpg,2008-07-11 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11576-mega-breakfast/,Ghostly,"When Johannes von Weiszacker claims ""I am oozing emotion"" on the Chap's epic 2005 album Ham, the idea seems both calculated and half-formed, as cleverly laid onto the mix as it was hastily scrawled onto a cocktail napkin. The artful dodgers that make up the Chap spend their time advocating a kind of listless dandy lifestyle, mixing rock riffs, beats, and one-liners that bemusedly rap on the state of pop culture. Extremely high-minded and arty, their very name comes from the Gustav Temple-edited British periodical and series of books satirically advocating a return to a ""civilized"" lifestyle. Here's the catch: von Weiszacker sings like he's never oozed (or anythinged else for that matter) an ounce of emotion in his life. The wonderful side effect of this superbly fake pop-rock is that it is it is also superb pop-rock. And Mega Breakfast is the Chap's superbly quirky coming-out party, as they've signed to Ghostly International for their first proper release in the States. Their beats, still emaciated and tinny, are beginning to sound less like they're trying to take the piss out of dance music and more like they've given the disco a much-needed tummy-tuck. These wispy shadows of rhythm back tautly packaged effete yarns ostensibly about something, like the silly human cycle of self-improvement and self-praise (""Fun and Interesting"") and the tacit fetishism of world music (""Ethnic Instrument"", which itself takes a page from the Talking Heads' touristy post-punk afro-funk), but these songs aren't really about anything in particular. If anything, they're un-songs. I suspect von Weiszacker and the gang (most tracks are sing-alongs) could sing about absolutely anything, like a cow shitting in the forest, and it would still be funny, because they'd be poking fun at cow, the forest, the song, and us for caring about any of it. So this must be what it's like to listen to indie rock made by aristocrats. Actually, check that: It's indie rock made by aristocrat lyricists-- they've worked too hard on music production to deserve claims of holistic silver spoons. No matter what kind of elitist B.S von Weiszacker spews, Mega Breakfast is much too elusive to serve as idly chuckling pop culture satire. As with Ham, violin accompaniments bow in and out of the mix, and even horns lend their swell and fade on the infuriatingly catchy ""Fun and Interesting"". On their website, the group claims Mega Breakfast to be a ""global smash-hit techno/R&B album,"" but at its core this record is still a lo-fi exercise. Try imagining the dissonant guitar chords of ""Caution Me"" on the next friggin' J-Timb joint. Try to jam ""Surgery"" onto the 8-bit Hall & Oates tribute album for which it so desperately yearns. You really can't rely on any tangible connection between Mega Breakfast and real life, except maybe Enon's classic High Society, a companion record of similarly decadent invective. On that note, it's true that Enon's jam came from across the pond, from the Grain Belt ennui of Dayton, Ohio, and thus might be the more imaginative achievement. But considering the humble roots of the Chap's debut album The Horse, recorded with one microphone and what sounds like a cassette tape recorder, the same ""Beverly Hillbillies"" comparison seems especially apt. In other words: anyone who has TV Land can tell you that while you can take the Clampetts out of the Ozarks, you can never take the Ozarks out of the Clampetts. These London patricians sound like they re-learned forty years of modern studio technology-- from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band onward-- by the time they burned up eighty quid of studio time, but still managed to retain the essence of wit without even breaking a sweat. This helps fulfill the Chap's preferred emotional response: These are people who don't really care all that much about the sincere history of popular music, but they still wouldn't mind too much destroying and rebuilding popular music from the ground up.","London avant-pop group signs to Ghostly International for its first proper U.S. release and displays an increased accessiblity that reinforces the Enon comparisons.

Mister Lonely: Music from a Film by Harmony Korine,Sun City GirlsJ.

Another argues that sound cues shouldn't call attention to themselves, but should unobtrusively underscore the emotional force of the scenes where they're used. Harmony Korine's movie about the friendship between a Michael Jackson and a Marilyn Monroe impersonator would appear to operate on the second principle: its soundtrack is so subdued, and often so soporific, that it threatens to evaporate at every turn. The ""ambient"" school of film music can make for great movies, but it doesn't tend to make for rewarding soundtrack albums, and playing the Mister Lonely soundtrack on its own is like seeing decorative borders without a picture inside them. It also might have been fun to hear an actual collaboration between J. Spaceman (aka. Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, who named half a dozen instrumental interludes on that band's new Songs in A&E after Korine) and the Sun City Girls, but alas, they split 17 of these 20 tracks between them. (The other three are just snatches of movie dialogue from Britta Gartner and Werner Herzog, and a brief a cappella piece sung by Rachel Korine.) The SCGs had clearly been itching to get into movie-score territory for a while-- their Alan Bishop compiled an excellent Ennio Morricone collection, Crime and Dissonance, a few years back. (The band's three previous soundtrack LPs, Juggernaut, Piasa...Devourer of Men, and Dulce, were all for films that don't seem to have actually been released.) Their contributions to the score were apparently recorded in 2006, before Charles Gocher's death last year, and even though they don't work up much forward motion, they've got pleasantly blurry depth (a few tracks involve what sound like Tibetan singing bowls) and a touch of creeping dread. ""Circus Theme"" is a slithering, scaly belcher of an oom-pah-pah organ solo, and ""Steppe Spiritual"" finds them revisiting their Torch of the Mystics-style singing-in-tongues. ""Mr. Lonely Viola"" is a cover of the sappy Bobby Vinton hit from 1964 that gave Korine's movie its name; with its melody carried by guest Eyvind Kang's viola, it's one of the tenderest things ever recorded by a band that almost never exposed its tender side. Spaceman's contributions, on the other hand, are singularly tedious-- without the conceptual grandeur of Spiritualized, all he can do is plod and doodle, and his sleepy little blues and arpeggios seem like half-considered sketches for the arrangements on Songs in A&E. (""Garden Walk"" is an orchestration in search of a theme.) Then there are his ""experimental"" tracks: if ""Stooges Harmonica"", 47 seconds of Pierce huffing and puffing at a harp, were to vanish from the earth, its absence would probably not cause a ripple, and the same goes for ""Panama 1"", which appears to be a combination of aleatoric fuzz-guitar feedback and somebody trying out a set of panpipes for the first time. Maybe this stuff has some sort of meaning or power in the context of Korine's movie; it sure doesn't on its own.","Harmony Korine's movie about the friendship between Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators is given a subdued soundtrack from Spiritualized's J.

Skeleton,Abe Vigoda,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a182b1335d7bf1698294/1:1/w_160/65e58e67.jpg,2008-07-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11557-skeleton/,Post Present Medium,"Although albums are born and bound by them, it's never easy to find a record's core in just one specific moment. But in the very first second of Skeleton's very first song, ""Dead City/Waste Wilderness"", all four dudes slam their individual notes into the ropes at once, and from there, everything follows some kind of frenetic punk ballet in which those moving musical parts are hopelessly trying to find their way back to their feet. Somewhere in that fraction of a second, a safe is blown wide, wide open, and its contents are pretty gnarly. Hailing from Chino but now residing in Los Angeles, the four men of Abe Vigoda have become fixtures and disciples of that city's Smell scene, younger vibe brothers to flag-carriers No Age, HEALTH, and Mika Miko. And while those bands have begun enjoying an impact farther outside the empty of downtown L.A., Abe Vigoda sound ready to be heard everywhere all at once. The band's debut, Kid City, was reason enough to take notice, but too raw and abrasive at times to allow its more digestible parts to be, well, digested. Skeleton finds the band expanding on and beautifying a sound very much their own: lush, tropical punk that's swallowed as many strains of sound as the images it conjures. Starting with the initial transition between the album's breakneck opener and the centipede guitar parts of ""Bear Face"", there's little in the way of slowing down. Songs clock in anywhere between 90 seconds and three minutes, but each is fully realized-- and with the exception of the title track, well-sequenced. While the first jabs of the ""The Garden"" offer a relative respite from the workout, the LP quickly reverts with highlight (and should-be closer) ""Endless Sleeper"", which shows a band just as capable of slowing down and pacing themselves as they are at exploding. Guitarists Michael Vidal and Juan Velazquez braid stabbing guitar parts that mirror both the warmth and romance of steel drum and South American six-string traditions, but retain a rapier's point throughout. Any clear tendency to bend towards more sun-stroked vibes is hammered all the way home by not-so-secret weapon Reggie Guerrero, whose stickwork dances with but never overwhelms his bandmates' guitars. Skeleton's flaws are few and often obscured by the album's mixing: Vidal's vocal adds an additional rhythmic layer, but his lyrical work is interesting enough to be more pronounced and less muddied. That said, Skeleton's manic pacing may prove exhausting-- its rapid-fire songs sometimes feel more like fragments blurred together by hypnotic drumwork and tactile soundscaping. It should take a long time to discover yourself and your sound somewhere within 40 years of pop music, but Abe Vigoda seem to have found their noise some other way. Every triumph and every misstep of Skeleton feels as if it grew organically, removed from the discussion of genre tags, written manifestos, or aural history projects. Some kids want to make loud noises because it's fun. There are too many of those to count in Skeleton.","Hailing from Chino but now residing in Los Angeles, the four men of Abe Vigoda have become fixtures and disciples of that city's Smell scene, younger vibe brothers to flag-carriers No Age, HEALTH, and Mika Miko.

Introducing Hanggai,Hanggai,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbdcabf31b7dc7155bac/1:1/w_160/f127cd83.jpg,2008-07-10 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11973-introducing-hanggai/,World Music Network,"Sometimes, an album takes you so by surprise that it takes days to get your mind around just how much you like it. Hanggai's debut was like that for me-- this record floored me the first time I played it. Simply described, this album takes traditional Mongolian folk music and instrumentation and projects them into a loosely rock-based structure. This is not really a folk album, though it sometimes has the feel of one. Producers Robin Haller and Matteo Scumaci, Westerners both, allow the band to straddle the folk and pop worlds, creating something new and exhilarating in the process.
 
Hanggai are a Beijing-based sextet of Mongolian musicians, a few of whom originally hail from China's Inner Mongolia province. Two of the members play the morin khuur (horse-hair fiddle), and while another plays the tobshuur, a two-stringed lute, and these instruments comprise the foundation of their sound. Tobshuur player and bandleader Ilchi was formerly in a Beijing punk group and put this band together after hearing the traditional khoomei throat-singing technique. Enthralled by the sound of this centuries-old singing style, he went to Inner Mongolia to learn it, where he ultimately met fiddle players Hugejiltu and Bagen. The combination of the group members' raspy, deep throat singing with a Western compositional sense of tension, build-up, and release is hard to describe apart from saying that it works very well.
 
It is rare that such attempts to modernize (read: Westernize) traditional folk forms actually enhance the power of the music, but that is the case here. Haller and Scumaci's very subtle additions of electric guitar, bass, and electronic textural elements nicely complement the traditional instrumentation-- the fiddles can produce long drones or billowing melodic figures, and the tobshuur is often used to give the songs a heart-racing rhythmic underpinning, with the help of some hand percussion.
 
The album's stunning centerpiece, ""Five Heroes"", opens with a long passage of throat-singing, with one member producing a steady, low drone while another manipulates the high, whistling overtones produced by it. The minimal guitar part has elements of surf, and is later used to inject a long, descending phrase between the verses. It's stunningly dramatic, and on hearing it my wife remarked that, even though they were singing in Mongol, she could feel the storytelling taking place in the lyrics. I have to agree.
 
The album is well-balanced between up-tempo and down-tempo offerings, and fast, rhythmic tracks like ""Flowers"". The natural ease with which these young musicians fit their mother culture's traditional musical arsenal into structures provided by another culture is remarkable-- unlike that horrible Yat-Kha album with the awkward throat-singing covers of Joy Division and Motörhead from a few years ago, there is never a sense of novelty in this music, just the sense that these unique, singular traditions can have a place in music moving forward. And that's perhaps the biggest reason that Hanggai's debut is an unmitigated success. It distills everything powerful about Mongolian folk music and makes something new from the ingredients. If you like this, I recommend trying out some actual traditional Mongolian music, though an understanding of it isn't remotely necessary to enjoy Hanggai. As it is, if you've never heard throat-singing or given a second (or even first) thought to Central Asian music, this album is a great place to start. Moreover, it succeeds on a purer level than that, as transcendently powerful music that anyone from anywhere can understand.","Beijing-based Hanggai take traditional Mongolian folk music and instrumentation and place them in a loosely rock-based structure, and the results are at times stunning.

We Are the South: Greatest Hits,8BallMJG,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbcf5e6ef95969322cd6/1:1/w_160/f25c6e94.jpg,2008-07-10 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11964-we-are-the-south-greatest-hits/,Koch,"An honest-to-God best-of from the Tennessee rap duo 8Ball & MJG would work something like a pocket history of Southern rap. On 1993's Comin Out Hard, their national debut, they kicked exaggerated crime-life tall-tales for six or seven minutes at a time over homemade car-trunk beats, never bothering much with hooks or structure. But the highlights from their last two albums, for Diddy's Bad Boy label, were exemplary streamlined head-knock club-rap. (Those last two albums, in particular, are the reason best-of albums were invented: a few undeniable snarls surrounded by seas of halfhearted radio-targeted filler.) Their outlaw-duo chemistry was there from the beginning, but over the years since Comin Out Hard, the two cultivated a fascinatingly schizo approach, swinging haphazardly from visceral bone-chilling pimp-talk to warm, openhearted up-from-nothing inspirational tales. And iPods being what they are, it's not hard to construct that narrative for yourself, to watch these guys develop over the years. But that's not what We Are the South does. Ball & G recorded too much material for too many record labels for a real best-of to ever happen, and We Are the South is more quickie cash-in than anything else. The bulk of the album comes from On Top of the World and In Our Lifetime, Vol. 1, two albums that the duo recorded for Tony Draper's Suave House label in the mid-1990s. The good news: Those albums are both classics, arguably the two high-water marks of these guys' aesthetic. Over woozily patient soul beats, the two spent these albums shading and developing their personas, adding depth and resonance by opening up and getting emotional without ever sacrificing the ripping impact of their hardest stuff. If you were going to assemble an 8Ball & MJG best-of from two albums, these would probably be the ones. On ""Pimp in My Own Rhyme"", 8Ball spits urgent mushmouthed threats over unforgivingly trebly G-funk synths. On ""What Can I Do"", an uncommonly candid MJG gives a harsh clarity to his memory of getting arrested for dealing drugs in front of his whole family. On ""Throw Your Hands Up"", the two play granite-heavy foils to the stuttery speed-rapping of guests Outkast. But this stuff is great enough that I can't conjure any real reason not to hunt down the complete albums instead of wasting time with a compilation that rips the songs out of their contexts and haphazardly shuffles them up. We Are the South comes padded with a few relative rarities from the two's not-as-good solo albums and from random mid-90s Suave House compilations. Of those, the only one that really demands to be heard is the sinuous banger ""Lay It Down"", with its surprisingly on-fire guest-appearances from Ice Cube and Diddy, of all people. The other tracks are mostly solid, but it's not like 8Ball & MJG were ever the type of group to save their best material for odds-and-ends comps. The only song here I'd actually call bad is the mediocre plastic-funk 8Ball solo track ""Starships and Rockets"". Other than that, it's a perfectly decent listen, especially if you're driving around on a lazy summer afternoon. But the essential stuff is easy to come by in more flattering contexts, and the inessential stuff is completely inessential. You're better off making your own best-of at home.","An honest-to-God best-of from the Tennessee rap duo 8Ball & MJG would work something like a pocket history of Southern rap. This isn't it.

Wagonwheel Blues,The War on Drugs,by: Stephen M.

As its title implies, the Philly quintet's debut, Wagonwheel Blues, is Americana reimagined as blacktop and yellow lines, rubber tires, and overpriced gasoline. The album urges you along the interstate, but never burdens you with the stigma of roots music or reached-for authenticity. Of course, the band invokes the usual influences: Adam Granduciel sings like Bob Dylan, spewing a torrent of words in accusatory second-person (""Chasin' squirrels around your property/ Makin' sure that they know that this is your kingdom""), and the band nods to fellow Philadelphians Marah, to the Waterboys, and of course, to the Boss himself. The Felice Brothers drove the same roads on their recent self-titled album, but where those upstate New Yorkers treated their Band dynamic as a link to a past more imagined than real, the War on Drugs filter these elements through the noise of early Yo La Tengo and Sonic Youth. Their songs are tangles of guitar, distorted harmonica, and droning organ, all wrapped so tightly that they become indistinguishable. Following a free digital EP, Barrel of Batteries, where two of these songs originate, Wagonwheel Blues sounds modern, outsize, and urban. On opener ""Arms Like Boulders"", guitars dart like tracers as Granduciel sings about...well, like Dylan, his lyrics demand some extreme parsing, giving few concrete details in favor of a general sense of subject matter and attitude. The War on Drugs' concerns, however, aren't necessarily narcotic, as their regrettable band name might suggest, but largely ecological and occasionally political: ""And so now that you realize that planets are spheres with oil on the inside / And your God is only a catapult waiting for the right time to let you go into the unknown."" On ""Taking the Farm"", Granduciel picks up that thought again: ""You can feel it in the ozone-zone-zone/ You can feel it in my knees knees knees,"" he sings above the controlled din, savoring the scatlike repetition and the long vowels. He may be referring either to the general buzz of bad omens or to the song itself, which adds a drum loop to their established formula, speeds things up, makes it infectious, then implodes in an ominous guitar finale. Back to back, these two tracks make an enormous first impression. Immediately following that pair of openers is the instrumental ""Coast (Reprise)"", despite the fact that the song it's nominally reprising doesn't come until much later in the album. It seems like such an odd choice in sequencing-- chasing two defining tracks with an atmospheric aside-- but their madness becomes more methodical with repeated listens. In fact, the War on Drugs have divided their debut into three sections separated by two instrumentals. It's a curious tactic: ""Coast (Reprise)"" and ""Reverse the Charges"" build open-road ambience with cascading guitars and synths, and although they can be repetitive and overlong, these buffer tracks generate an immersive lurch and lull, which makes Wagonwheel Blues distinctively roadworthy. Beyond that, they reveal the band to be more than simply a backdrop for Granduciel's familiar singing and songwriting. Wagonwheel Blues is largely a collaboration between multi-instrumentalists Granduciel and Kurt Vile (whose own album, Constant Hitmaker, elaborates on this solid approach), and they emphasize sound and song equally, showing a wide musical range despite the limited elements. ""Buenos Aires Beach"" churns a trippy dread with filtered acoustic guitar, psych-rock organ, and a military snare rhythm. Slurred guitar notes hoist ""There Is No Urgency"" aloft, with only faint drums as ballast. And ""Show Me the Coast"" is a 10-minute epic that devolves into what might best be described as the E Street Band doing shoegazer. On Wagonwheel Blues, the War on Drugs' approach comes across as not only natural, but imminently worthwhile, as if these revered sources needed to be roughed up a bit to sound new. So the Arcade Fire-sale organ on ""A Needle in Your Eye #16"" (one of the best approximations of that band's cathedral-size sound) may initially seem immodest against Granduciel's classic-rock vocals and the relentless snare rhythm, but the War on Drugs aren't just another indie band with arena ambitions. Instead, they craft a big sound for their big ideas, so that Wagonwheel Blues fills the space between horizons.","Secretly Canadian introduces a solid new Americana band that-- althogh steeped in the usual influences (Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, the Band)-- never burdens you with the stigma of roots music or reached-for authenticity.

Nude With Boots,Melvins,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbebea9e61561daa7358/1:1/w_160/19b94c9a.jpg,2008-07-10 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11986-nude-with-boots/,Ipecac,"Is it uncharitable to suggest that the vast numbers of tribute acts the Melvins have inspired in their 20-year run are as much the result of some crucial flaw in the band's sound as they are an homage to its greatness? Former Melvin Joe Preston recreated that group's faux-operatic, sub-sonic bass rumbling with Thrones, then went on to help Earth hone in on the latent power of the Melvins' crackling guitar drones, flipping them into the dirge-y masterpieces Melvins wouldn't write. Boris borrowed their name from a Bullhead song title, and their titanic volume from the band's early records, but still let their sound stray from Melvins' drummer Dale Crover's Bonham stomp into more varied space. Sludgy tribute-song contributors Eyehategod were more visceral, and Nirvana were definitely better songwriters. And then there is Big Business, the two-piece Melvins-homage act whose Here Come the Waterworks I like better than anything the Melvins have ever released, mostly because the Waterworks songs are less detached, less route-- more memorable, more concise, more dynamic. As it happens, this newest Melvins is called Nude With Boots, which I guess is what happens in hard rock when fairies lose their clothes, and is the band's second release with Big Business' Coady Willis and Jared Warren as members. This meta-collaboration coughed up (A) Senile Animal in 2006, the band's most listenable record in a decade or so. The extra personnel helped them really wreak havoc on already erratic time signatures, plus they went in for some spine-tingling and unlikely double and triple melodies, a first in a catalogue without a major surprise since the monotonous noise terror of 2001's The Colossus of Destiny. Nude With Boots opens with ""The Kicking Machine"", the latest in a long tradition of album-opening Melvins tracks that sound a lot like Led Zeppelin songs (pretty much ""Good Times Bad Times"" without the fey chorus), particularly all of Lysol, whose entire triggered drum sound was lifted off of Houses of the Holy. ""Billy Fish"" revives (A) Senile Animal's big-guy-with-pigtails vocal harmonies; ""The Smiling Cobra"" is more Crover bass drum worship. It's unclear how there hasn't been a Melvins track named ""Dies Iraea"" before; its twangy drone and cymbal taps are a lot like what Earth started sounding like after they stopped sounding like the Melvins. The doubleshot of ""The Stupid Creep"" (deadpan sneering) and ""The Savage Hippy"" (drum machine type brutality) could be a Big Black nod, but maybe I think that just because of the Racer-X-like songtitles. What's left to say? This band is still nearly as big, as slow, as lumberingly loud as they were in the days Kurt Cobain was trying out for a spot on bass. Their disciples help but not meaningfully: What would you say in a room full of your heroes? What has nothing to do Nude With Boots is the band's unending regression to its own amusement, its abstract stomp, its desire to punish (last track ""It Tastes Better Than the Truth"" pits a howling Buzzo and Warren against one another). Melvins have got nothing to do with me, which isn't to say I don't like 'em. They've got a great drum sound.","Melvins' latest-- the band's second release with Big Business' Coady Willis and Jared Warren as members-- proves they're still nearly as big, as slow, as lumberingly loud as they were in the days Kurt Cobain was trying out for a spot on bass.

Object 47,Wire,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe35e6ef95969322d0e/1:1/w_160/b480ef81.jpg,2008-07-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11979-object-47/,Pinkflag,"  Object 47 marks an unexpected turning point in the 30-year history of Wire: It's their first album that doesn't feature all the original members. When drummer Robert Gotobed (née Robert Grey) temporarily fired himself from the band in 1990, reasoning that drum machines had rendered him redundant, the remaining members shortened the bandname to Wir. For whatever reason, the recent departure of Bruce Gilbert-- who made only minimal contributions to the Read & Burn 03 EP-- hasn't led to the same symbolic gesture. The album opens with a rush on ""One of Us"", with Graham Lewis' sharp and strongly melodic bassline, Grey's efficient beat, and a Colin Newman vocal that may be his best since the band reunited in 1999-- his refrain (""one of us will live to rue the day we met each other"") is both ominous and oddly celebratory. In fact, the track is so strong that the rest of the record feels like a bit of a let-down in contrast. At least at first. While none of the other songs share the opener's bracing immediacy, they eventually reveal more subtle charms and innovations on repeated listens. Part of this replayability stems from the fact that the album's nine songs are widely varied. ""Perspex Icon"" finds Newman layering guitar tracks and filtering his voice to fit the straightforward punk his bandmates give him-- one of few times the band attempts to compensate for Gilbert's absence with overdubs. On ""Circumspect"", they simply let Newman's circular guitar figure get swallowed by undulating bass while he sings in a subdued, almost tired tone. ""Four Long Years"" is effortlessly rhythmic, but it still has that very distinctive sonic coloration-- mechanistic but warm-- that's characterized Wire's reunion records. The sound of Object 47 is generally clean. Even when the vocals are being run through processors and the guitars are distorted, it still feels managed, and a lack of high-range makes it inviting and easy to listen to even at its noisiest. This rings especially true for the buzzing ""All Fours"", featuring feedback courtesy of Helmet's Page Hamilton. The clear production doesn't serve ""Patient Flees"" as well, though-- it's the only track here that genuinely doesn't work. The list of spoken words that stands in for a chorus just doesn't have the intended impact, and the floundering verses can't make up for it. Still, on the whole, it's another strong outing from post-comeback Wire. Though Gilbert was an essential member and his contributions are missed here, there's still no mistaking Object 47 for the work of any other band.","The legendary punk band's 11th studio album is its first without Bruce Gilbert, making it an unexpected turning point despite appearing more than 30 years into Wire's career.

Old Home Movies,The Botticellis,by: Adam Moerder,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd713d197565213b1a0/1:1/w_160/88df28eb.jpg,2008-07-09 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11971-old-home-movies/,Antenna Farm,"In the spirit of classifying any remotely poppy album released between May and August as a ""summer album,"" Old Home Movies really hits a sweet spot right about now. There's surfer reverb, slouching croons, and sunny melodies all over the Botticellis' debut album, and, to top it off, the band hails from San Francisco. Written over the last four years in between day jobs, Movies proves an airtight first effort, the band's deliberation is apparent in every shrewdly placed nook and cranny. Frontman Alexi Glickman possesses a fitting nursery rhyme cadence for the band's nostalgic surf pop. Named after a barrel-shaped wave the band finds particularly gnarly, the Botticellis wouldn't know stormy weather if it rained on their bonfire. The opening title track bounces along like a Walkmen track fresh out of rehab, Glickman's rosy reminiscing unaffected by lyrics about Alaska and snow. ""New Room"" shows off saccharine hooks on par with the Shins yet sharing the lethargic quality of Papercuts' Jason Quever, who coincidentally provides some spot drumming and engineered the album with Scott Solter. At its strongest, the band manages to inject its happy-go-lucky sound with at least a few pangs of sadness and/or mystery. ""When I Call"" crawls through spikey guitar arpeggios and a haunting vocal from Glickman, so sedated it could pass for a Yo La Tengo track. Glickman pulls off some great British Invasion-like gems, too, aided by the fact that his voice eerily resembles George Harrison's or, one of the most Beatles-esque non-Beatles, Jeff Lynne. ""Flashlight"" and ""Who Are You Now"" share ELO's grandiose interpretation of the fab four's pop sensibilities, though it's considerably tempered by the Botticellis' laid-back vibe. The main beef here, if you want to call it that, is the tendency to sometimes lapse into nondescript MOR. ""Stay With My Brother"" and ""Tongue Is Blue"" match the album's lax pulse, but wander aimlessly in a comfort pop zone. Glickman's charisma also hasn't quite caught up yet with his songwriting, either, making for lots of memorable hooks couched in a limited range of expression. There's basically soothing and slightly louder soothing, which is fine if you don't mind investing next to nothing in lyrics or dramatic climaxes. Despite these setbacks, there's nothing to despise about these fresh-faced upstarts-- and really not much to gush over, either-- but Old Home Movies meets its sun-soaked influences with a firm high-five. Hot dogs on the grill, anyone?","An airtight first effort, this San Francisco band's deliberation is apparent here in every shrewdly placed nook and cranny. The Papercuts' Jason Quever produces.

Fear of Flying,David Karsten Daniels,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbcdabf31b7dc7155b8e/1:1/w_160/217eec36.jpg,2008-07-09 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11962-fear-of-flying/,David Karsten Daniels,"""When you cease to walk/ Your bones turn to chalk,"" twentysomething David Karsten Daniels moans in long-drawn, halting breaths, sounding like an old man ineffectively raging against the dying of the light. The weary ache of ""Wheelchairs"" sets the stage for a concept album of sorts. Fear of Flying, Daniels' fifth solo (but only second widely available) LP is a collection of songs inspired by his grandparents' physical decline, songs that flip thoughtfully through some complex, if well-thumbed, existential issues: mortality, God, and the struggle for faith. A former member of North Carolina's Bu_Hanan musical collective, Daniels recently uprooted to Seattle, but brackish Appalachian groundwater still seeps from his rustic compositions. And his left-coast migration aside, Daniels again garnered studio support from the tarheel colleagues who backed him on 2007's Sharp Teeth. A backwoods orchestra of strings, keys, and, unexpectedly, saxophone populates the otherwise bare branches of slow-surging folk-pop song ""Martha Ann"", and a female vocalist's warm and vigorous harmonies extend Daniels' limited range. ""Oh, Heaven Isn't Real"" is a blasphemous rebuttal from the pews, a handclapped and howled hootenanny arguing that ""Hell is a lie, hell is a lie/ The preacher's up there trying to get you to make nice."" It's the only cut here that exudes unfettered joy, and its catchy church-ditching chorus is the album's biggest take-away. Not to say that some of Daniels' more austere efforts aren't compelling. An anxiously pounded single-chord piano figure boldly underlines ""Falling Down""'s black-humored account of a catastrophic car accident. ""In My Child Mind You Were a Lion"", slowly piles layers of organ glow and cymbal sizzle on a foundation of ruminative fingerpicking for the kind of long-coming catharsis familiar to Jason Molina fans. Its musical drama is well-earned: ""Lion""'s lyrics probe the devastating-- and universal-- experience of witnessing seemingly all-powerful parents shrink to husks before your eyes. Molina, however, isn't the solo-guy-with-guitar with whom most people will compare Daniels. No, the elephant in this particular room is a scraggly-bearded Kentuckian with royal affectations. Daniels' kinship of timbre and phrasing (not to mention, some overlapping lyrical concerns) with Will Oldham forces a contest in which Daniels places second. Too often, Fear of Flying forces its profundity, as in the life-cycle lesson, ""Every Time a Baby is Born"" or the Lord's Prayer recital of ""Evensong"", which, as the final track, strands the album on an ambivalent, unsatisfying plateau. No one expects a modest singer-songwriter to solve humanity's basic quandaries in 11 songs, but Daniels could learn something from Oldham: In the midst of death we are in life and might as well live, love, lust, even sin, while we wait for the Reaper's cart to come around and collect us.","David Karsten Daniels' latest is a collection of songs inspired by his grandparents' physical decline, songs that flip thoughtfully through some complex, if well-thumbed, existential issues: mortality, God, and the struggle for faith.

"Assassins: Black Meddle, Pt. 1",Nachtmystium,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5bc0084474cd0c2832/1:1/w_160/65df5738.jpg,2008-07-09 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11584-assassins-black-meddle-pt-1/,Century MediaCandlelight,"It's an interesting time for American black metal. The genre's focus is usually on Northern Europe, but years after Profanatica, Demoncy, Von, Absu and Judas Iscariot among others proved you could make black metal in New York, North Carolina, Texas, and Illinois, projects such as Leviathan, Bone Awl, Cult of Daath, Inquisition, Ashdautas, and Wrnlrd are creating a uniquely American voice within the genre. Some are crossing over into a noisier realm, like Ashpool; there are also ambient crews like Velvet Cacoon, the shoegaze of Wolves in the Throne Room, plus Averse Sefira and Negative Plane, who are rewriting orthodoxy. Then, on their own branch of the black metal tree, there's Nachtmystium. When Nachtmystium started in the late 1990s, frontman/cofounder Blake Judd was a corpse-painted youngster going by the moniker ""Azentrius,"" and the band was little more than Darkthrone and Burzum rehashed. After slowly and surely shifting and developing a more unique sound the Chicagoans surprised longtime fans and detractors alike by releasing 2006's excellent E-bow-drenched Instinct: Decay. It's a super album, flawed only in the production-- a recording style that worked well when Judd was interested in straight-up black metal, but that couldn't contain the newfound psychedelic scope of the newer set of compositions. Enter Nachtmystium's brilliant fourth full-length, Assassins: Black Meddle, Part 1: The 45-minute collection's Judd's crowning achievement, one of the best albums released this year. Compared even to Instinct, Assassins is an upgrade in every way-- from the dense production by Minsk's Sanford Parker at his Volume Studios (Rwake, Lair of the Minotaur, Pelican) to the sharper guitar licks, the tighter songwriting, and the intense drumming of multi-tasking scene vet Tony Laureano. It adds up to a unique, powerful blend of 70s-drenched black'n'roll. Referencing Pink Floyd the moment something sounds like windswept head music might strike some folks as lazy, but Judd's Floyd references are everywhere, from the album title-- Assassins: Black Meddle Pt. 1, this is Nachtmystium ""meddling"" with the black stuff-- to the opening song ""One of These Nights"", a stormy, creaking, and then riffing introduction of sorts and straight-up tribute to (and echoing of) Pink Floyd's ""One of These Days."" Assassins isn't a small production: Yakuza's Bruce Lamont plays saxophone during the proggy three-point ""Seasick"" closer, Parker added Moog and other effects, and there are guitar solos by Jeff Seay and Pharaoh's Matt Johnson. As usual, the band's sorta invisible member/Judd's right-hand man Chris Black (Superchrist, Dawnbringer) wrote the majority of the lyrics and added keyboards, programming, and some voices. Meanwhile, Neill Jameson, aka N. Imperial, aka Krieg, penned the words for ""Code Negative"" and Judd wrote the punk-rock call-to-arms ""Assassins"". Letting others provide the libretto must have given Judd more time to focus on and hone the other aspects of the songwriting, because these tracks kick ass in a way that best Watain, Disfear, Mastodon, or Motörhead tracks kick ass. Following ""One of These Nights"" we get the aforementioned ""Assassins"", a blistering, weakness-rejecting, ""fuck you."" The song's eight minutes long, its riffs slowly emptying into doom-ier guitars and swirling atmospherics. None of these stretches are boring. Each excursion turns up something exciting: For instance, after ""Assassins"" dissolves into minimal atmospherics, we get another amazing headbanger, ""Ghosts of Grace"". Throughout, the heavier stuff is balanced by songs like ""Away From the Light"", which uses spare piano to create a two-minute build (and breath catcher) for my favorite metal track of the year, ""Your True Enemy"", in which Judd lets us know that ""you have made my hatred possible."" Shifting gears, the album ends with the three-part, 12-minute ""Seasick"", which moves from the gentle, proggy guitars of the intro ""Seasick (Part I: Drowned at Dusk)"" into the Opethian boogie of the second section, ""Seasick (Part II: Oceanborne""), where Bruce Lamont's saxophone competes with Spanish-inflected guitars. The final portion, ""Seasick (Part III: Silent Sunrise)"", is a proper, elegiac exit. But is Assassins a black metal record? As much as Nachtmystium distance themselves from the black metal scene-- last month Judd told me ""We're trying to break away from [black metal] and broaden our scope""-- the band's reference points remain within that genre. Attitude-wise, they dropped off the Nile tour because they weren't into it. And, as Judd told me, ""we don't want to tour with guys with funny little haircuts and tight jeans on..."" Musically, the vocals remain harsh and ""evil,"" but they're also simply rock'n'roll. The guitars buzz as much as they reach for psychedelic heights. The foundation is forged in black metal, but Assassins is more about breaking molds than casting them. Assassins contains big, almost stadium-sized anthems, monumental drinking songs, gorgeous instrumental excursions, prog-metal, and solos that make you catch your breath. It's metal at its best, regardless of the genre tag stuck to it.","Branching out with a new set of psychedelic compositions, Chicago's Nachtmystium make one of the best hard rock albums of the year, a crowning achievement for the still-developing world of American black metal.

¿Cómo te Llama?,Albert Hammond Jr.,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf0c0084474cd0c298a/1:1/w_160/e5d1d350.jpg,2008-07-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11989-como-te-llama/,RCARCA,"This is the second Albert Hammond Jr. album released since the Strokes' last album, 2006's First Impressions of Earth. The rumor mill may be aching for new Strokes album details, but Hammond-- always pegged as one of the band's creative forces-- is doing his best to ensure our survival until then, and the extra face time's well-deserved. Hammond follows his solid debut Yours to Keep with another tasty helping of power-pop, though on ¿Cómo te Llama? he sheds the inherent modesty of a solo spin-off and aims higher. Although his songwriting credits with the Strokes are slight, Hammond retains his band's melody-first minimalism. The arrangements here remain just as efficient and inconspicuous as YTK, and Hammond's vocals unequivocally steer the songs, his even-keeled delivery resembling a less id-driven Julian Casablancas. However, Cómo veers from past work by stretching these straightforward components across a wider array of styles and histrionics. You can still distinguish all the Guided by Voices, Beach Boys, and new wave building blocks, but in spots they're re-appropriated for, say, a disco or reggae soundclash. At times, the added bombast helps trick listeners into thinking they're listening to something more complex than power-pop. Opener ""Bargain of a Century"" enters with fanfare, bookending its devil-may-care verses with a melodramatic riff that scales Arcade Fire to Hammond-friendly proportions. On paper, ""Victory at Monterey"" reads like a potential disaster, its disco bassline and piston-pumping Franz Ferdinand riffs running the risk of kowtowing to New York dance-punk douchebaggery. Fortunately, Hammond never lets the focus shift from catchiness to genre fidelity, and the track's an unlikely highlight. Surprisingly, Cómo only contains a handful of single-friendly, three-minute pop songs. First single ""GfC"" and ""In My Room"" make nuanced changes to the formula of YTK singles ""In Transit"" and ""Everyone Gets a Star"", but other similarly structured tracks skew Hammond's pop sensibilities. The verse and chorus of ""Borrowed Time"" sound like totally different animals, shifting harshly from reggae to lead-footed rock. The super-twee ""Miss Myrtle"" and ""G Up"" also stumble by deviating too far from the norm, especially when they don't deliver the home run choruses Hammond's led us to expect at this point. On the whole, Cómo's not a weaker album than YTK, but it sounds like it's overcompensating for its likely increased exposure. A seven-minute instrumental, ""Spooky Couch"" nevertheless feels tacked on. The inconsistent genre surfing could work if Hammond had greater charisma as a vocalist, but, considering the stylistic pratfalls on First Impressions, eclecticism's never been a strength for him or his kin in the first place. The crazy thing is, these missteps don't hinder the half-dozen or so gems that stay lodged in your noodle long after playing. At a time when indie audiences are demanding more and more esoteric touches like Afro-pop, lo-fi C86isms, or Balearic revivalism, a songwriter like Hammond feels like a well-needed junk food binge. He may not blaze new paths, but his sickening talent, when coupled with all these accessible touchstones, often proves more than adequate.","The Strokes' creative linchpin follows his solid debut Yours to Keep with another tasty helping of power-pop, though on ¿Có**mo te Llama? he sheds the inherent modesty of a solo spin-off and stretches his songs' components across a wider array of styles.

Bubble and Scrape Deluxe Edition,Sebadoh,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe513d197565213b1bb/1:1/w_160/9e347afd.jpg,2008-07-09 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11981-bubble-and-scrape-deluxe-edition/,Sub Pop,"Bubble and Scrape marked the point at which Sebadoh's aesthetic evolved from ""quick, where's the four-track?"" to reasonably well-crafted indie rock, arguably, the defining sound of that perpetually slippery genre. The band's previous full-length, the scabby, schizoid III will always have its partisans-- as will Lou Barlow and Eric Gaffney's early collections of sound collages and song scraps-- while casual fans typically gravitate to the post-Gaffney pop and polish of Bakesale. But this fourth official album, originally released in 1993, may be the band's holistic best. With actual arrangements, tracks longer than two minutes, and, partly courtesy of Bob Weston, reasonable production values (it's relative), B&S isn't as shiny and commercial (hey, I said it's relative!) as later records. Released on what was then the flannel-shirted nation's flagship label, Sub Pop, (on Domino in the UK), B&S is where Sebadoh began to sound like an actual band-- a sniping, self-mutilating three-headed hydra of a band. But a band nonetheless.
 
A handful of live cuts, including Necros' cover ""Reject"", several alternately worded album tracks, and other rarities augment Domino's deluxe re-release, along with three sets of (naturally) contradictory commentary. Fifteen years on, Barlow, Gaffney, and Jason Loewenstein are still performing their dysfunctional-family roles in the liners. Gaffney makes repeated credit-grabs; Barlow rationalizes Gaffney's exile from the band's fragile democracy; and Loewenstein offers what probably comes closest to verisimilitude in his account of Sebadoh's prickly dynamics. Welcome to the indie rock version of Rashomon.
 
Whatever the players' disputes, the original record is pretty fairly partitioned. Barlow is credited with seven tracks, Gaffney with five, and Loewenstein with four. Barlow's songs, though, were almost always the promotional focus (certainly after Sub Pop got the band on contract) and, for better or worse, became Sebadoh's defining sound. Album openers ""Soul and Fire"" and ""Two Years Two Days"" are prototypical: preternaturally melodic, verging on sing-song (I once heard someone refer to Barlow as a ""tune machine,"" which exactly nails both the catchy genius and mechanical nature of his songwriting), and stacked with plangent guitar clang, flag-waving choruses, and 16-wheeler loads of romantic baggage.
 
Barlow named an actual track for girlfriend, then ex-girlfriend, then wife, Kathleen Bilius on III, but almost every song of this period directly or covertly negotiates that relationship's volatile power balance. Acoustic duet ""Think (Let Tomorrow Bee)"", boasts one of Barlow's most-affecting melodies, dexterously handling his signature subject (""Let tomorrow be/ I can't be so impatient/ Pushing every answer/ When there isn't any question""). As we learn from the reissue's extras, final studio takes emerged from much sappier drafts of high school poetry magazine fodder. The album version of ""Soul and Fire"" brims with self-esteem compared with Barlow's acoustic demo (one of the deluxe issue's few really intriguing add-ons). Like the most pathetic answering machine message you've ever heard, it swaps the original refrain ""I think our love is coming to an end"" for ""call me if you ever want to see me again."" The only thing missing is, ""please pick up, I know you're there."" Needless to say, Barlow's hurt/angry/sensitive/manipulative personality matrix worked like catnip on indie girls back in the day (not that I'd know anything about that).
 
He may have been reluctant to admit it, but Barlow was lucky to have a ballast in Gaffney, whose avant-garde impulses, skin-peeling screams, and unsentimental sentiments-- served up blunt and bruising on ""Elixir is Zog"", (Capricornnn rising!), ""Emma Get Wild"", and the hardcore via rockabilly of ""No Way Out""-- dissipate any lingering self-pity fogging the windows. It's Loewenstein, though, who turns in the most surprising, most effective songs on B&S. ""Happily Divided"", a spare, dour, affectless folk-pop number is the best Barlow song Barlow never wrote. And the anthemic ""Sister"", with its incestuous insinuations and massive riffs, plays angry, cathartic id to ""Soul and Fire""'s superego. Loewenstein also gets the last word when he pays thunderous tribute to band mascot/Northampton, Mass. scenester Mike Flood.
 
Plucked from the detritus of 90s independent music, B&S may noy be the generational touchstone of Slanted and Enchanted or Exile in Guyville (and if Liz was shadow boxing anything, it was exactly this strain of guy culture), but relegating it to the Indie Rock Era nostalgia ghetto, where a band's ""cred"" usually dictated the reception of its records isn't fair, either. These songs hold up just fine to repeated plays, particularly if you stack them next to today's Mac-enabled faux-low-fi. And if the bonuses to this reissue aren't exactly revelatory, the original album remains a critical document in the evolution of underground DIY. Don't listen to it for its historical value, though; listen to it because it's awesome.","Sebadoh's first step from four-track aesthetics to well-crafted songs is one of the key documents of 1990s U.S. indie rock, and the original Sub Pop release is now augmented by Domino with a handful of live cuts and songs from Bubble and Scrape-era singles.

From Heaven,Todd Barry,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb6eb335119a49ecad4/1:1/w_160/0fd0823f.jpg,2008-07-08 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11945-from-heaven/,Comedy Central,"Folks find this out about Todd Barry not more than ten seconds after he opens his mouth, but for those that haven't yet been exposed to this man's work on the stage and screen, please take note of the following and plan accordingly: Mr. Barry is a sarcastic son of a gun. And I might be underplaying just how sarcastic he is. Just about every statement he makes comes fully equipped with its own exasperated eye-roll. Having such sentiments delivered in a deadpan voice that even at its most excited brings to mind a sardonic golf announcer only accentuates their withering world-weariness. He doesn't suffer fools, and fortunately for his comedy his definition of ""fool"" doesn't discriminate-- it includes star-struck realtors, audience members showing some benign beer-powered school spirit, the Gawker media empire, dumb ass fans e-mailing him about the age limit of a club he's playing, and, of course, renowned comedic stylist and voice actor Todd Barry. Unfortunately, From Heaven turns out to be a poor showcase for Barry's formidable talents. The album was recorded in front of a readily receptive crowd at the Comedy Studio in Cambridge, Mass., the renowned Chinese restaurant/comedy club that gave birth to (among others) the upright Eeyore to whom Barry and many other comics owe their career, Steven Wright. Barry's act is spread across sixteen tracks, though the tracks aren't their own succinct skits. Each track contains three or more jokes that might or might not be thematically related. This slice-and-dice is mildly inconvenient, and utilitarian track titles like ""Preachy Singer, English Washer, Alabama, Pittsburgh"" aren't the most memorable or graceful things (though ""Anal, Set An Alarm"" is a notable exception). That said, it's a toss up between this configuration and making like the Minutemen or Naked City by offering over forty tracks, some of which barely last a minute. For the sake of interested iTuners, erring on the side of less tracks is definitely the way to go. What keeps this run-on hodgepodge of jokes held together is Barry's comedic acumen and charisma. While it might seem odd that someone in a perpetual slouch could possess charisma, it's easy to imagine the same material bombing in the hands of a different performer. Barry might strike the pose of a slacker elder statesman, but he attacks his act with the precision of a true professional. When he resorts to tried and true stand-up lead-ins (""You guys on the MySpace?""), it's done with a knowing smirk and wink (""yeah, I'm on the MySpace, why not? I'm only 43""). If a joke seemingly runs aground or outlasts its welcome, Barry immediately cops to its failure and plays off it. A bit about ""a-dor-a-blay"" prairie dogs and comparatively underwhelming panda bears becomes a half-ass metaphor about Barry (the prairie dog) opening for other comics that seems to garner a so-bad-it's-good round of applause-- Barry acknowledges the reception by noting the joke's spotty success rate, and then keeps the show moving. He's also savvy enough to know when to keep on beating a dead joke until it comes back to some semblance of life. The snags in From Heaven come when Barry goes to the well once too often. Jokes that might sound great the one time they're heard while sitting in an audience shrivel up and die upon a second or third listen on this disc. A leadoff gag about Barry chilling and swapping high-fives with his buddy Chris Rock discussing the nobodies that open his act is spot-on, as is a little skit about having someone read his e-mail. But with every subsequent self-referential dart about his stature (financial or otherwise) in the entertainment industry-- the aforementioned prairie dog/panda discussion, a riff on his apartment being featured in Architectural Digest as The Pretentious Douchebag Palace, his hatred of certain abbreviated words ruining a date with Julia Roberts-- the reversed-negative aw-shucks charm quickly fades. The same goes for some of Barry's observational bits-- more often that not, he's able to find something out of left field to offer a refreshing POV about quotidian things, but bits about a ""Nurses Kick Butt"" t-shirt and Chipotle's McDonalds affiliation come off lazy and sub-Seinfeldian. The jokes on From Heaven that have the most replay value are those where Barry actually gets worked up and lays into something worthy of his ire, be it someone's casual bigotry about the South or someone asking Barry right before his set to rag on an audience member for his birthday. Of course, ""worked up"" is a relative term-- even at his most excitable, Barry sounds like he's asking a bank teller for a receipt, which actually makes these scathing takedowns even more potent and humorous. Unfortunately for this consummate comedic professional, these inspired moments are few and far between. The more one listens to From Heaven, the more it sounds like just another day at the office.","An album of stand-up recorded at the Comedy Store in Cambridge, Mass. by the famously deadpan comedian known for appearances on ""Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist"" and ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"".

Steal My Horses and Run,Blackstrap,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbcbabf31b7dc7155b8a/1:1/w_160/c2faa63d.jpg,2008-07-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11960-steal-my-horses-and-run/,Tee Pee,"Just when I fool myself into thinking every indie group from Sweden approaches rock from the same refreshing angle as, say, the Cardigans or Love Is All, a band like Stockholm's Blackstrap pinches me, and I remember this supposed music utopia also spawned the likes of Soundtrack of Our Lives and the Sounds. Hiding behind a readymade wall of sound, Blackstrap offers an inexhaustible array of profound reverb and full-tilt choruses. As tempting as their shoegaze habit sounds on paper, the band's delusions of arena rock grandeur render sophomore album Steal My Horses and Run a real un-pretty piece of art. Considering the band's countless similarities to fellow Tee Pee acts the Warlocks and Brian Jonestown Massacre, it'd be easy to construct a retconned bio of Blackstrap growing up in some unsavory West Coast city, hooked on heroin and hand-me-down 45s. Fist-pumping fuzz anthems play tag team with languished blues ballads, and the track titles (e.g. ""Lay Down Low"", ""The Bitter, The Sweet"", ""Still Sore"") make no bones about the pathos here. Regardless of drug-test results and geographical fawning, though, these Swedes ape mind-altering genres in the most organized, deliberate manners possible. Whereas the BJM or Warlocks obsess over a particular niche of psych-rock for entire albums at a time, Blackstrap's sensibilities fall in line with more polished, accessible ""bad boys"" like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the Dandy Warhols. Every track on Steal My Horses gets exactly the sound it wants, from the sweeping open chords of the Swervedriver-inspired ""City Beat"" to the dust bowl acoustic on ""Still Sore"". Ironically, the immaculate execution of all these styles causes the album to sound homogenous in its uniform cleanliness. The shared vocal duties between Jonatan Westh and Maria Lindén staves off the ho-hum songwriting, but only to a point. The Linden-led ""Repulsion"", the band's closest stab at MBV, contains more hooks than the rest of the record put together. At Westh's brightest spots, he rivals 120 Days' Ådne Meisfjord for the ""Scandinavian Bono"" title, but he often fails to match his band's instrumental pompousness. ""Lay Down Low"", for one, gets sloppy with U2's ""Elevation"" formula, juxtaposing an engine-revving verse with a mild-mannered psych chorus. Steal My Horses' shortcomings ultimately stem from their desire to suck all the playfulness out of genres already hurting for some levity. There's not one lyric or riff that sticks in your brain by the album's conclusion. This would be fine if the band's goal were atmospheric shoegaze, but the rigid verse-chorus-verse patterns of these songs suggest a kind of immediacy the tracks can't deliver. While no one wants another Anton Newcombe-sized ego in indie rock, a little bit of animal magnetism wouldn't hurt this band, not when their most charismatic member is the effects pedal.","Yet another Swedish group, although these neo-shoegazers are more Soundtrack of Our Lives and the Sounds than Jens Lekman or Love Is All.

Döda Fallet,Vapnet,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc95e6ef95969322cc4/1:1/w_160/71b020a8.jpg,2008-07-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11958-doda-fallet/,Hybris,"According to songwriter and guitarist Martin Abrahamsson, Döda Fallet is Vapnet's first traditional popskiva-- its first true pop album. He created the bulk of the band's excellent full-length debut, Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar, and the follow-up, Något Dåligt Nytt Har Hänt, on his home computer, but with the addition of the band's first full-time drummer, Vapnet decided to record its third album in a proper studio, hiring Mattias Glavå to produce. However, Döda Fallet (which translates to ""the dead fall"") represents no dramatic musical sidestep. Instead, it continues in roughly the same headphones-pop vein as their previous efforts: The band still draws from the formalism of Swedish pop and the florid movement of Swedish dance to locate all sorts of musical possibilities in its intricate arrangements. Glavå, who worked on recent albums by Sambassadeur and Jens Lekman, adds just a touch of reverb to the instruments, giving the songs an added depth of sound that reinforces both their exuberance and their melancholy. A lone tambourine launches opener ""Stockholm, Sett Snett Uppifrån"" and is eventually joined by Abrahamsson's piano and Philip Gates' drums, which sound new in this context. Then the song flies away with Anna Modin's flute, carrying it to its swirling chorus. Modin's vibes illuminate first single ""Plötsligt händer det inte"", racing against the strings on the chorus and chased by Gates' manic bongo rhythm. That song, incidentally, includes the band's first English lyrics-- the short line ""Keep up the good work""-- which, for an American listener at least, is startling. In the past Abrahamsson has either set Vapnet's songs to programmed beats or shared percussion duty with singer Martin Hanberg, so the presence of a live drummer makes a big difference on Döda Fallet, investing ""Nyår"" and closer ""Det Rör Inter Hjärtat"" with a sense of danceable motion. The former in particular trips along on Gates' disco-inspired, heavy-on-the-high-hat drumbeats, summoning sleigh bells and strings to push Hanberg's tricky vocal hook and Abrahamsson's typically elegant guitar theme. As if to compensate for their headlong pace, Vapnet sequence these two songs alongside slower numbers-- respectively, the halting acoustic ballad ""Jag Lät Bara Sanningen Gå"" and ""Skorpan"", which sets Hanberg's precise vocals against a simple, lonely piano melody and a muted trumpet solo. Vapnet's songs move mercurially, seemingly changing form with every measure. Stand-out ""Snart Går du Inte Själv"" begins with what sounds like a harpsichord, then transforms into a folk-pop strummer, then into something new and unqualifiable when Per-Olaf Stjernered's saxophone enters from the dark end of the street, layered and placed somewhere near the center of the song's three-dimensional mix, right behind Hanberg's pop-soulful vocals. Stjernered plays a short, simple ascending melody, as if walking over to shake your hand, and as far pure musical pleasure-- divorced from the concerns of geography, language, scene, or genre-- that sax is profound, and its appeal lies not so much in the way the band use it in the song, but in the mere fact that it exists. That sense of pop purity is essential to the band's appeal, at least to non-Swedish-speakers. At its best, Döda Fallet sounds like pop in its ideal form.","Martin Abrahamsson created the bulk of the band's excellent full-length debut, Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar, and its follow-up on his home computer; now, with the addition of the band's first full-time drummer, Vapnet have moved to a proper studio and made what they are calling their ""first true pop album.""

Pacific Ocean Blue: Legacy Edition,Dennis Wilson,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb313d197565213b158/1:1/w_160/5cfb1992.jpg,2008-07-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11943-pacific-ocean-blue-legacy-edition/,LegacyCaribouLegacyCaribou,"We're certainly lucky that Brian Wilson got it together to complete the legendary Smile sessions, his long-languishing answer to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band-- many didn't expect him to reach middle age. With brother Dennis there was also a suspicion he would depart before his time and, sadly in that case, those fears came true. Indeed, all three Wilson brothers suffered the physical and emotional scars left by their abusive father, Murry, and the middle Wilson brother coped by living the fast life of a rebellious drifter. He fell in (albeit briefly) with Charles Manson and ran through many wives and girlfriends. Always overshadowed by brothers Brian and Carl, drummer Dennis fell victim to the common misconception that session player Hal Blaine manned the skins exclusively in the studio at Brian's behest. In actuality, Dennis made sporadic but dramatic contributions during even Brian's creative peak, steering the group towards surfing culture and nurturing rough-hewn musical talents before drowning off the shore of Marina del Ray in 1983 at 39. By the mid-1970s, with Brian a troubled recluse and Mike Love angling for more creative control, Dennis Wilson entered the studio with his friend and songwriter Gregg Jakobson; in 1977, he released Pacific Ocean Blue-- a raw, bluesy masterpiece of ocean-worshipping psychedelia. The record was always tough to find, but unlike SMiLE it's no ""lost"" classic: released around the same time as the middling Love You, Brian's attempt at a 70s comeback, Pacific Ocean Blue actually sold about the same as its counterpart, about 300,000 copies. Problem is, the record was out of print for almost 20 years. Despiite positive critical notices, Dennis was once again swept under the rug. Pacific Ocean Blue, however, is a wonderful study in Beach Boys surfer soul imbued with the expressiveness of Dennis' piano style. It's also a meditation on a complex world, one devoid of the nostalgic innocence preached by the Mike Love-fronted Beach Boys of late, and its remastered, 2xCD Legacy Recordings release-- the first CD release of the album since 1991-- is astoundingly refreshing. Unlike Brian, who circa SMiLE was tweaking his vocals to sound younger (on ""Child Is Father of the Man"" Brian sounds more like classic Eno than classic Wilson), Dennis' voice had already deteriorated due to years of hard living and heavy drinking. Seething with emotion, Wilson's croon is plain but pliable, sounding on ""What's Wrong"" like a grizzled blues or folk singer but stretching to higher registers on ""Pacific Ocean Blues"". Wilson was in his mid-thirties when he recorded the vocals to ""Time"", a sorely honest piano-driven ballad about womanizing; nevertheless, he sounds like someone physically and emotionally twenty years his senior, a grizzled old soul reveling in the ephemeral nature of time and, more surprisingly, love. The second disc is a collection of tracks written during and after Pacific Ocean Blue for Caribou Records with Carli Muñoz. Dennis originally thought that the results of these sessions would become Bambu, his planned follow-up to Pacific Ocean Blue, but his increasing substance abuse problems and Beach Boys obligations kept it from completion. So the tracks that make up the Bambu disc here are by no means meant to comprise the album as it was originally intended. Wilson once called the record ""a hundred times better than Pacific Ocean Blue""-- a boast he was never able to back up. At any rate, some of these songs trickled onto late 70s Beach Boys records, and many of them have already been made available on bootlegs throughout the years. Completists might complain that the entire Bambu sessions aren't included, but considering the volumes of recording that Wilson managed in the late 70s, a little bit of editorial discretion here is appreciated. This second disc doesn't feature a whole lot of continuity, however, shuffling awkwardly from psychedelic soul jams like ""Wild Situation"" to the towering synthesizer-tinged pop instrumental ""Common"". The moodiest compositions on the disc are the peaks: ""Common"", ""Are You Real"" (which suddenly turns into an outtake from Air's The Virgin Suicides), and the analog synthesizer strains of ""Cocktails"" hint at new artistic blueprints for Wilson. Closing the disc is ""Holy Man"", an unfinished composition that Wilson never got a chance to sing over, and here they are filled out by uncannily similar-sounding vocals by Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins. Brian Wilson grew obsessed with comparing himself with Paul McCartney; comparing Dennis to his Beatles counterpart makes little sense except in terms of contrast. Whereas Ringo was a consummate professional who adopted a simple-seeming but complex playing style, Dennis Wilson developed his own talents almost entirely on the back of emotion, not technical expertise. His works show the obvious influence of the blues and soul, with Wilson manifestly stating the predicament of his own aimless love and rootless existence. Always an artistic spirit, a slacker with a penchant for surfing, an incurable womanizer, a morbid alcoholic, Dennis Wilson was a player in life's essential boundaries, fated to cross the big one far too soon. Anyone enthralled by Brian Wilson's 30-year journey from the brink should examine Dennis' work as well.","The other ""lost"" Beach Boys solo classic-- this one by troubled middle Wilson brother Dennis-- finally gets a re-issue after being out of print almost 20 years.

LP3,Ratatat,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbcc5e6ef95969322ccb/1:1/w_160/f0bf25b9.jpg,2008-07-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11961-lp3/,XL,"There's something fascinating about the mercenary nature of soundtrack library music-- pay-per-use stuff that is composed behind the simple idea of a generating an aesthetic mood; music designed to make your brand cooler or your TV show more action-packed without having to rely on the pre-existing memories that come with, say, a Who song. Despite the fact that there's nothing inherently commercialized about their club-music-skewing instrumental electronic rock, Ratatat seem to have been slotted into this very purpose over the course of their career, to the point where the same song of theirs-- ""Gettysburg"", from their 2006 album Classics-- has been used to score both a Nylon.com Marc Jacobs fashion show feature and a GOOD Magazine animated video on the nuclear arms race. Aside from what visual or informational stimulus someone else augments Ratatat's music with, there isn't really that much content there-- or, conversely, there's potential for the music to be and sound like anything but no one discernable identity. And yet this isn't to its detriment. Ratatat's music is only really as empty as you make it, and with LP3-- like Classics and their eponymous debut, a title that looks deliberately unevocative of anything-- the duo of guitarist Mike Stroud and multi-instrumentalist Evan ""E*Vax"" Mast has created a soundtrack for just about whatever, modular music that turns its lack of contextual framing into a likeable sort of walk-around/drive-around/social gathering background music that doesn't exist to sell anything but your own current experience. It's a bit blank, but that only means it begs to be drawn on with fat markers, and any voiceless absence of humanity is made up for by the fact that runtime scripts don't get this arch just on their own. (The leadoff track's called ""Shiller"", ferchrissakes.) The core Ratatat formula remains largely intact-- deceptively basic but heavily layered pan-genre hook-loops that hover inside some kind of disco/rock/hip-hop triangulation, supplemented by Stroud's bionic Brian May guitar work and Mast's enthusiasm for making synthesizers emit hyperactive space-fight sounds. And it's surprisingly endurable over four-minute doses, like the beat-em-up video game groove of ""Falcon Jab"" or the Loverboy roller-boogie of ""Shempi"", which pack in enough energy and dynamics to keep a good balance between catchiness and restlessness. It doesn't quite jump out as readily in the quieter or calmer moments: the semi-acoustic, tabla-driven ""Mi Viejo"" evokes sweeping scenes of Southwestern vistas in some sort of Sergio Leone-goes-Bollywood score scenario, and the downtempo ""Bruleé"" resembles the sort of melody the Bee Gees would've written in 1970 applied to short-circuiting robo-pop, but their pleasures aren't quite as immediate. One of the other keys to LP3's simple appeal is its vague but noticeable internationalism, like the work of a couple of guys who were told by a director to ""skew kind of Timbaland"" and decided to take that superficial, derivative task into more far-flung places. ""Mumtaz Khan"" lands between Middle and Far Eastern on the rhythmic backbone of a Miss E banger; ""Mirando"" layers pitched-up Thin Lizzy riffage over a rhythmic motif somewhere amidst Calcutta and Rio and Miles Davis' ""Black Satin""; and tracks like ""Imperials"" and ""Bird Priest"" ride rhythms that have some tangential connection to a non-Western musical structure or another, turning them inside-out and blurring their origins to make them sound unstuck in geography. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book, and erasing the borders of international music into a sound that evokes little more than ""indistinctively foreign"" has its own pitfalls, but somewhere inside all that TV spot rock runs a pulse that beats like Top 40. Which is where the disappointment comes in: even the best beats on this album feel unfinished without vocals. There's nothing intrinsically flawed about what's otherwise a solid instrumental record, but so much of it feels so close to many of the things happening on the radio and the pop charts right now that, 90 seconds into a song, the mind might start wandering and wondering what this kind of stuff would sound like with Wale or Rihanna on top of it. Ratatat released a brief but solid two-volume run of self-released mixes that put this kind of music under the likes of Memphis Bleek and Missy Elliott and Kanye West, and it worked well, so maybe those releases and LP3 are warm-ups for a strange, new kind of career in R&B and hip-hop production as some kind of weird nu-Neptunes. For now, we'll just have to fill in the blanks.","On their third album, Ratatat have created modular music that turns its lack of contextual framing into a likeable sort of walk-around/drive-around/social gathering background music that doesn't exist to sell anything but your own current experience.

In the Meantime,Kid Static,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb865e6ef95969322c28/1:1/w_160/0cdc3133.jpg,2008-07-07 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11618-in-the-meantime/,PrettyBeat,"Hip-hop, the internet and indie culture: They're arguably the linchpins of independent rapper Kid Static's artistic identity, and yet he dedicates at least one song apiece on his second solo album to ripping each a new one. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. Yes, empty gestures and idiocy abound, so it makes sense that a smart guy like Static would call bullshit. Still, there's a danger in getting boxed in by sheer negation, and for the overwhelming majority of In the Meantime, the Chicago emcee sounds like nothing so much as a man without a home. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Static is particularly fond of the kind of buzzing, metallic beats that instantly signify a grouchily dystopian outlook to anyone who's ever owned a Def Jux record. Almost everything on this half-hour platter-- proper songs and periodic instrumental interludes-- leers with disjointed rhythms and spare clatter. There's even a track of eggheaded sociological pedantry, ""Of Prophets and People"", from a dude who already sounds a good bit like Mr. Lif anyway-- complete with herky-jerky sub-Autechre beat work! Fortunately, most of Static's lyrical artistry is reserved for pure misanthropy, and if rappers, bloggers, and hipsters need someone (else) to write a version of ""Radio, Radio"" just for them, he's certainly not a bad man for the job. ""Internet Superstar"" is a relatively predictable but still spot-on piece of musical pwnage, earning points for castigating the chickenshit racism of the modern-day message board and, admittedly, making nice with a requisite lolcat reference as well. More strangely and memorably, the succeeding ""Man Up"" finds Static aiming his ire at indie dudes who wear women's jeans, expressing stupefied disdain at the concept of ""Cutting off blood to your package/ Just to get some action."" And lest it be said that Static's only conveys contempt for the subcultural habits of white people and isn't an agent for change, there's the helpfully individualized ""Hates on a Plane"", a wicked little narrative wherein our hero serves up rough sexual justice to a belligerent fellow airways traveler. Erring on the truly funny side of mean with lines like ""You got on tight pants but one titty's bigger than the other,"" Static proves himself a worthy contemporary of down-to-earth, grown-man shit-talkers like Murs and Rhymefest. Like those rappers, he'll probably be underrated largely because he occupies an uneasy middle ground in the hip-hop landscape, failing to exhibit enough of the righteous piety expected of the underground's saviors while lacking the pop appeal to cross over. Perhaps this reality has something to do with why Kid Static is most complicatedly aggrieved over hip-hop itself. Wasting no time on ""Rappin N Shit"" in claiming ""I don't battle,"" Static proceeds to state that ""if you're the emperor of this rap shit then I'm Brutus,"" before very deftly poking fun at hip-hop's nagging self-reflexive tendencies with the refrain ""Picture me rappin' about rappin' 'n shit."" ""I Identify"" threatens at first to be another acid bath with its opening aside of ""stereotypical yo"" followed by Static's mocking boast that ""Everything's a freestyle/ I got bitches."" Then a funny thing happens, and just before the end of this 30-minute pisstake Static actually opens up a little bit about ""growing up in Illinois,"" and even in the midst of a groaning joke about Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes finds cause to confess ""This rap shit is the best trip."" Hopefully this fleeting moment of positivity won't prove to be too contagious-- Static has potential to be just the kind of self-aware cynic a frequently over-reverential art form like hip-hop always needs.","Chicago rapper lashes out at the internet, indie culture, and even hip-hop itself, but his entertaining persona keeps him from being boxed in by his misanthropy.

I Miss This,Weird Weeds,by: Mike McGonigal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb7abf31b7dc7155b5d/1:1/w_160/42640eaf.jpg,2008-07-07 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11946-i-miss-this/,Autobus,"We're smack dab in the middle of 2008, and I don't know about you but I'm pretty damn sick of psychedelic folk-rock, oblique concept albums with short connecting instrumental bits, fey high-pitched vocals, and songs that have birds chirping or bells in them. Also, anyone who sounds remotely influenced by Neutral Milk Hotel might as well be in an electroclash tribute band or yet another fake doomcore band, knowhatI'msayin'? Sometimes, enough is enough, and in general this stuff seems more played out than Mike Myers. I Miss This is the third album by the Austin-based trio of Nick Hennies, Sandy Ewen, and Aaron Russell. Recorded in their own house over the course of seven months, it's full of subtle little touches-- it's what critics like to call ""meticulously crafted."" These dudes certainly put a lot of work into it and it shows. Composed of 17 interlocking tunes that vary from one to just over seven minutes, it's structurally similar to the first two Soft Machine albums. There are even times that I Miss This approaches the crazed inventiveness of that band, albeit mostly in a sedate and whispery way. Some of the best songs here drop folk-rock to just flat-out rock; the pulsating and stunning minute and a half of ""Save the Dogs"" would fit on a mixtape of the year's best songs. The jagged ""Lies"" mixes witch-y, Joanna Newsom or Dead Science-esque folk dirge with early-1990s indie-prog. It's pretty righteous, especially with that creepy, creaking violin going on throughout most of it. Not all the folksy songs are bad by any means. ""We're Gonna Die"" is a lovely folk song with a cloud of multi-tracked vocals floating atop a wonderful fingerpicked guitar. I Miss This has much to like about it, but overall it feels overworked. To stick with food metaphors, I don't know if the problem is that too many spices were added or if it was left in the oven too long. Either way, I suggest picking around the overly precious parts to get at the meat.","Just when it seems like psychedelic folk-rock had completely run its course comes the third record from this Austin group, a disc structurally similar to the first two Soft Machine albums.

Nigeria Disco Funk Special / Nigeria Rock Special,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb82abf31b7dc7155ae5/1:1/w_160/db2ab7c1.jpg,2008-07-07 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11694-nigeria-disco-funk-special-nigeria-rock-special/,Sound Way,"Earlier this year, Britain's Soundway Records returned to compiling West African music after a four-year break. Not that those four years were spent lounging about in their pajamas--they reissued 45s from Colombia, Barbados, Nigeria, and elsewhere in that time, put out a couple LP reissues of vintage Afrofunk albums by Sierra Leone's Geraldo Pino, and put together funky comps of music from Colombia and Panama. And the label's founder, Miles Cleret, also spent a lot of time in Nigeria laying the groundwork for a stunning series of compilations of the country's pop music. The first dropped a few months ago-- Nigeria Special, which focused mostly on highlife and assorted other mildly funky sounds from the 1970s over its two discs, was up to the extremely high standard the label set for itself early this decade with its Ghana Sounds and Afro Baby compilations. And now they've followed it up with two more discs, this time hitting the discotheque and the rock scene to bring some seriously funky music to a wider audience than it was ever afforded in its day. Like his compatriot Samy Ben Redjeb of Analog Africa, Cleret painstakingly researches every song he wants to reissue and tracks down the musicians, making sure to properly compensate them for using their work-- there's a whole crop of reissue labels popping up now that do this, and it's sort of mind-blowing that it took so long for it to become the norm. Soundway's refreshing ethics aside, the real reason to pay attention to them is simply that Cleret has such good taste-- his intrepid journeys into the heart of West Africa's record industry yield thousands of records, but he's good at being judicious with his track choices. You're getting the cream of the cream here, and your ears won't be the only parts of your body that notice. Nigeria Disco Funk Special: The Sound of the Underground Lagos Dancefloor 1974-1979 offers nine tracks of deep, quite well-produced groove-- by the late 70s, Nigeria was home to plenty of high-tech studios to give the country's musicians the sheen they required as they kicked their funk into a new disco gear. Cleret makes the unusual (for him) move of repeating someone else with his inclusion of Joni Haastrup's ""Greetings"", which previously appeared on Strut's now out of print Nigeria 70 compilation, but if you'd heard the song you probably would've repeated it too. This is one of my favorite Afrofunk tracks, with a great psychedelic intro featuring flailing flutes and distant calls from Haastrup that sets up an absolutely sick dancefloor beat that would require a truckload of mirror balls spinning in unison to do it full visual justice. Otherwise, Cleret goes way off the beaten path. I'm a huge fan of the SJOB Movement's first album (1970's A Move in the Right Direction), but I didn't even know they had a second one. Nevertheless, Cleret sources a slamming disco-funk jam with an avalanche of a synth hook called ""Love Affair"" from it. Bongos Ikwue & the Groovies' ""You've Gotta Help Yourself"" is four boiling minutes of wah-drenched guitars, jazzy trumpet, and lyrics that reference ""God Bless the Child"" in the chorus. T-Fire's ""Will of the People"" has some of the heaviest drums I've ever heard. This is definitely disco-era funk, but it's still very gritty-- you'd never mistake any of it for Silver Convention or Chic-- and the Nigerian bands tended to add liberal doses of jazz freedom and rock crunch to their dancefloor mixture. The opposite could be said for Nigeria Rock Special: Psychedelic Afro-Rock & Fuzz Funk in 1970s Nigeria, where the fuzz guitars, trippy vocals, and heavy riffs are spiced with liberal doses of bottom-heavy rhythm. Nigeria's rock scene rose mostly from the campuses of the nation's universities in the wake of the Biafran War, and the bands came from all over the country but were especially common in the East, which had suffered the most from the war. The members of BLO (it was an acronym of their first names) had played with Ginger Baker in Europe for a few years, as had Joni Haastrup, whose rock band Mono Mono is also featured here. These were two of the country's biggest rock bands, and BLO closes things out here with ""Chant to Mother Earth"" (another Nigeria 70 repeat), a slow, lysergic crawl toward some sort of bliss, chemically-induced or otherwise. There are a couple of nasty psych-funk instrumentals, including Ofege's ""Adieu"", which has a great organ lead and a fantastically tangled guitar solo-- Ofege was a very prolific band, and their Higher Plane Breeze album provided one of the Nigerian rock scene's iconic images with its cover shot showing one member squatting amongst his bandmates, middle fingers raised high and proud toward the camera. If you're a dedicated collector of this music, you'll recognize the names Tunji Oyelana, the Funkees and Ofo the Black Company (the heaviest of them all), but it's amazing how many utterly obscure but great bands Cleret turns up here. The Hygrades? Colomach? Tabukah 'X'? The Elcados? These are not familiar names, even to collectors. None of those unknowns disappoint, either. The Hygrades' ""In the Jungle"" is a dynamic heavy funk-rock instrumental with a brilliant guitar part played by Goddy Oku-- the guy made his own guitars and the wounds he could squeeze from them recall Hendrix at times, but with Carlos Santana's pinpoint tone control. The Elcados' ""Ku Mi Da Hankan"" has a great, breezy three-against-four rhythm, Colomach, who were actually a Malian band visiting Nigeria, offer a strange, minimal psychedelic chant with an Afro-Cuban rhythm, and Joe King Kologbo & His Black Sound mix hectic traditional rhythms with a heavy psychedelic chorus for a truly singular track. The most explicitly rock track, Question Mark's ""Freaking Out"", is still pretty funky, but it's definitely an oddity-- the vocalist sounds like he could have sung for the dB's, and there's an almost punk edge to the playing. If you're already a fan of funky West African music, I recommend these sets to you without reservation. Go get them. More broadly, anyone into funk in general or the subtle permutations of vintage global pop music would be well-advised to dig this as well. From the royalty structure to the sound to the packaging to the research and of course the music, Soundway gets it right on these compilations. Afrofunk fans could hardly have asked for more.","Covering two sides of the multifaceted Nigerian pop landscape of the 1970s, these two first-rate compilations from Britain's Soundway touch on disco-tinged club music and heavy riff-rock, with a strong undercurrent of funk being the thread through it all.

Hymn and Her,Earlimart,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb9ea9e61561daa72e1/1:1/w_160/f93d44b9.jpg,2008-07-07 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11948-hymn-and-her/,Shout! Factory,"As Earlimart frontman Aaron Espinoza discovered a few years back, sometimes heroes can become mentors-- even friends. A chance encounter with Elliott Smith in Portland turned into a long-term relationship that would help steer Earlimart's development from a roughshod, brooding college rock group into an underground success. Smith and latter-day guides Grandaddy are obvious talking points for the Southern California group, and the former still looms over the band five years after his untimely passing. On Earlimart's sixth album, Hymn and Her, Espinoza and partner Ariana Murray seem determined to explore the possibilities of change and nudge away from the Smith-meets-Sonic Youth tropes that have defined their career. The full-blown changes haven't quite come yet, but Espinoza has cast his melodic net into the vast but well-charted waters of psychedelic rock. At times, the earnest machinations of ""God Loves You the Best"" recall the orchestrated warbles of the Flaming Lips and aspire to OK Computer at its most maudlin. Engineer Andrew Lynch has the Dave Fridmann touch, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was his hand that added the incongruently smoky touches of mariachi horns and tremolo-affected ""desert guitar"" of ""Cigarettes and Kerosene"". Arrangements seem meticulously planned where once there was friction between the group's melodic sensibilities; a lightly lush piano-pop here matures into an agreeable lilt-- to good effect on ""God Loves You the Best"", ""Teeth"", and ""For the Birds"". The duo began making these moves prior to last year's Mentor Tormentor in both a quest to duck its own stylistic baggage and a reaction to personnel changes that left the two of them on their own. You may have noticed the pun in the record's unfunny title, which predicts that Murray has raised her profile on this record by taking more active writing duties after penning ""Happy Alone"" on Mentor Tormentor. Fortunately, she complements Espinoza well, rescuing his vocal musings from the abyss of romantic equivocation and providing a rougher side to the band's harmonies, and on ""Before It Gets Better"", lead vocals. Murray seems the more world-weary vocalist than Espinoza, whose smooth croon hews closely to Ben Gibbard's blueprints for enunciation of purple prose. And so the problem with Hymn and Her is-- after years of being called out for sounding too much like their peers-- it feels like they're plagiarizing themselves. Raather than fully implementing Earlimart Phase Two, as they have hinted, the duo is still dressing up the same minimally satisfying ditties in ruffly fuzz; its still scrupulously orchestrating the same kinds of songs that appear on simpler, better Earlimart records. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with the pair's current M.O., the tendency to calmly and competently copy the solid compositional mechanics of people who will always be much more famous than them. But for a record which so heavy-handedly claims to be a bona-fide collaboration between Espinoza and Murray-- and which associates Espinoza with religious song (dig Hymn and Her's quietly arrogant titles)-- it seems like the only constant here is maddening consistency.","Southern California group releases its sixth album of gritty indie pop with tinges of folk, continuing to excel at craft while struggling to differentiate itself from its peers.

Modern Guilt,Beck,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe0abf31b7dc7155bbd/1:1/w_160/3ab54128.jpg,2008-07-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11977-modern-guilt/,Interscope,"On his tour behind 2006's The Information, Beck and his band were accompanied by a troupe of marionette doppelgängers. Projected onto a big screen, the dot-eyed puppets mimicked the group with uncanny accuracy; if Beck triumphantly raised his hand during ""Devil's Haircut"", his counterpart quickly followed. As the distance between concert DVDs and concerts themselves continues to dwindle, the puppet scheme was a winning example of spontaneous, analog cleverness. It was also a crafty bit of outsourcing. The cute figurines provided much of the night's visual entertainment while offering a distraction from Beck's increasingly uninvolved performances. Since the famed stops on his Odelay tour more than a decade ago, he's become a static shell of his former break-dancing, bed-humping self. Similarly, while Beck has gotten darker and more apocalyptic, he's tried to temper his direness with upbeat, counter-punch production from the Dust Brothers, Nigel Godrich, and now, Danger Mouse. Though Modern Guilt is more direct and consistent than his last two scattershot LPs, it also finds the disillusioned L.A. hippie struggling to balance his deathly outlook with his more crowd-pleasing inclinations. It wasn't always like this. At his creative peak Beck tackled everything from R&B to hip-hop to folk, and more often than not, his songs' sentiments matched their styles. On a base level, Sea Change was full of downtrodden couplets matched with picturesque melancholia; the falsetto zaniness of Midnite Vultures corresponded with its equally bizarre and hilarious imagery. And while there were plenty of serious specters like ghosts and devils all over Odelay, they were used to symbolize the invincibility of youth while the album's pastiche funk kept the post-modern party alive. But starting with Guero, the disconnect between the singer's frisky beat-based pop and his suffocating anxieties became more apparent (""Earthquake Weather"", for instance, was filled with musings like, ""The days go slow into a void we filled with death""). And now, after the overlong space jam The Information warned of modern society's ills while pumping futuristic dance-folk, we get Modern Guilt, probably Beck's most harrowing collection of songs yet. As usual, you probably wouldn't pick up on the record's gravity by putting it on at a cookout. Danger Mouse does a decent job of injecting the record with the same 1960s sounds found on Gnarls Barkley's LPs: Scratchy snares, surf-rock rhythms, and piano vamps pop up and disappear in no-nonsense, three-minute bursts (at just over a half hour, the disc is half as long as The Information). Beck's first new producing partner in eons, Danger Mouse mostly plays into the star's love of vintage aesthetics while working in snippets of his signature style. The wobbly rocker ""Orphans"" could be a Mutations outtake, drum 'n' bass lullaby ""Replica"" would sound at home anywhere on The Information, and the lush ""Volcano"" would have made an excellent Sea Change bonus cut-- it's also one of very few songs on the album that couples its tenuous ennui with an appropriate backdrop. Interestingly, the record's best psych-rock showing-- the tripped-out ""Chemtrails"", featuring a wicked drum exhibition courtesy of longtime Beck collaborator Joey Waronker-- is also the only track that doesn't include any of Danger Mouse's beats or loops. Elsewhere, Beck pushes his happy/sad dichotomy to its breaking point. ""Gamma Ray"" combines a beach-party beat with ecological updates (""If I could hold hold out for now/ With these icecaps melting down"") and a call for nuclear annihilation. The title track comes on with plenty of Spoon-esque strut and swagger only to dwell on collective insecurities: ""Don't know what I've done but I feel ashamed."" These are nice tricks, but after two albums of similar bait-and-switches, they grow tired; with the world legitimately bent on a one-way trip to hell, Beck fails to ease the tension with the unadulterated fun he built his name on. (Tellingly, the 38-year-old recently admitted he's ""not proud of"" several songs from his wildest LP, Midnite Vultures, all signs of which have been erased from his live show.) ""I'm tired of people who only want to be pleased/ But I still want to please you,"" sings Beck on closer ""Volcano"". It's the most personal song on the album, where the alt-rock journeyman stunningly conflates his own troubles with those of the world at large. In his heyday, Beck seemed to please everyone by pleasing himself-- each new genre excursion was met with new fans and a fresh appreciation for his limitless talent. Now things don't come so easy. ""It's harder and harder to write songs these days,"" he told The New York Times last week. ""I'm always slashing and burning, going, 'Is this too on the sleeve?' But if you're not up front like that then you're hiding behind something, so it's a real maneuvering."" With its off-the-cuff cover, brevity, and ramshackle feel, Modern Guilt comes off like Beck's attempt to outrun those songwriting complications. But the reluctance to break with his own conventions is still evident. The album ends with a look ahead: ""I don't know where I've been, but I know where I'm going/ To that volcano/ I don't want to fall in, though/ Just want to warm my bones on that fire a while."" It's a cautious prophesy-- maybe too cautious.","More direct and consistent than his last two scattershot LPs, Beck's latest-- produced by Danger Mouse-- finds the disillusioned L.A. hippie struggling to balance his deathly 21st century outlook with his more crowd-pleasing inclinations.

Someone Else's Deja Vu,"Son, Ambulance",by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc85e6ef95969322cc0/1:1/w_160/1111ac3b.jpg,2008-07-03 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11957-someone-elses-deja-vu/,Saddle Creek,"I guess it's sort of a buzzkill to start off this way, but Someone Else's Déjà Vu is more interesting as a state-of-music-criticism case study than a collection of songs: If we're really doing our jobs here, this sentence will feature the last time you see ""Ben Folds"" in a Son, Ambulance review. On previous outings, Mr. Battle of Who Could Care Less (can't believe Brian Howe used ""Brick""-layer before I had a chance to) and Son, Ambulance's Joe Knapp were namedropped in an approximate 1:1.5 ratio, but not only has Knapp given us nearly four years to dig up different piano man comparisons, he's pretty much ditched the ivories altogether. But even if one of Saddle Creek's most quietly ambitious artists is flying without a net, it's hard to call it thrilling, since Knapp forsook that adjective when he punned on his band name. Which just gives us another easy way out while dealing with Son, Ambulance's third LP, which is intermittently fluid and challenging in its arrangements and occasionally gorgeous-- but a lot of times, it just feels like you can't possibly finish it in a wakeful state. For the first couple of listens, Knapp's willingness to play dress up carries the day. ""A Girl in New York City"" is a bit tough to trace lyrically, but it does an admirable job capturing the essence of its saucer-eyed title character, reflecting all sorts of wonder and culture-vulture consumption in its constantly morphing, light-loafered samba arrangement; the brief forays into buzzy guitar soloing even brings to mind Hissing of Summer Lawns-era Joni Mitchell, before the fever-dreamy ""Legend of Lizeth"" takes a soak in Canterbury Calgon. But Son, Ambulance is too laidback to be out of a comfort zone for long, and the wafting major chords of ""Quand Tu Marches Seul"" finds ""technically proficient Piano Magic"" and ""heavily narcotized Dears"" as the borders. What ties all of it together is Knapp's modest everydude voice, which rarely is intrusive but even more rarely sounds like it's operating from a position of strength. ""Wild Roses"" goes for a real-talk romance in the manner of ""Something"" (down to the George Harrison-worshipping guitar solo), but it's more suited for ""Nashville Star"" where an appropriately outsized voice can realistically compete with the beyond-shlocky lyrics (""You can take her out dancing/ Spend all night drinking beer"") and gooey instrumentation-- Knapp tries to kick things up with an ill-fitting backwards echo effect that sounds like his larynx getting shredded. But he also lacks the grit that could sell the rootsier material- the hangover balladry of ""Yesterday Morning"" simply stews when it's trying to simmer, and it's not so much an anchor as an albatross-- there are points where you wonder if it's ever going to end. Occasionally, Someone Else's Déjà Vu is focused enough to be effective-- the off-time strums of ""Horizons"" manages to kickstart an otherwise terribly drowsy midsection, while ""Juliet's Son"" provides the most luminous passage through gauzy, low-key harmonies despite the words not really hitting like they should. But such concision is a rare find on a record that Knapp likely considers to be his Lifted, an Americana feeding frenzy that considers its sprawl as much of an end as the means. But more than any pedal steel touch or straight-shooter lyric, what made that record is something sorely lacking here, namely being young and full of shit enough to see limitations as hurdles instead of ceilings. The proof's in the title: Someone Else's Déjà Vu would've benefitted from Knapp making a stronger claim of ownership to his lofty visions.","After 20,000 Ben Folds comparisons, Son, Ambulance's Joe Knapp-- one of Saddle Creek's most quietly ambitious artists-- has pretty much ditched the ivories altogether on his latest album.

Season of Sweets,Modey Lemon,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc5abf31b7dc7155b7c/1:1/w_160/22ef2a7b.jpg,2008-07-03 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11954-season-of-sweets/,Birdman,"Even an exceptional garage-rock band might be dismissed out-of-hand for failing to transcend its genre. This happens most often with critics, but there are understandably plenty of dilettante fans who only want to hear the most innovative, top-tier acts. It's a situation that keeps some great bands from getting great press and, in some cases, drives some of those cream-of-the-crop bands to distraction. It's a trap that Modey Lemon have fallen into: being an above-average garage-rock band from their debut up through Thunder + Lightning somehow wasn't enough. 2005's The Curious City added many psychedelic touches and ADHD song suites to their overall sound, and while they'd grown pretty far from their spirited beginnings, they managed to grow up with grace. The Curious City would have been a great album for them to ride off into the sunset on-- and after the three years of silence that followed, I'd assumed they had. While the band's return from their hiatus is welcomed, Season of Sweets presents what would have made for a fine batch of rough-and-ready rock songs that the band should be used to cranking out, were they not weighed down by their grander ambitions. The proto-metal riff of ""The Bear Comes Back Down the Mountain"" is anchored by a purple synth-bass gurgle, and the rest of the record rolls forward on an impressive low-end rumble. The song nods to the psychedelia they dabbled with on Curious City, but adapted into their own more economical and familiar style. Yet its simple melody is stretched a bit thin over its five-minute duration, which sets the tone for this often loose, occasionally plodding batch of tunes. The dropped-note swing of ""The Peacock's Eye"" loses much of its momentum during a half-hearted instrumental interlude, and even the sugary chorus of ""It Made You Dumb"" grows tired the third time around. The drumming is inventive and buoyant throughout, but it would need to be-- even with the addition of Jason Kirker on bass, leaving Phil Boyd to Moog and guitar, the frequent instrumental breaks are often aimless. There's an appropriately icy guitar tone and the rattle of snare taps on ""Ice Fields"", though the vocoder and siren noises are superfluous details. This track and many others are close to the syrupy vintage psyche of their labelmates and buddies in Apes, though not nearly as thorough or convincing in their psychedelic nods. While I'm not one to complain over someone taking a page from Oneida, the searing guitars and frantic organ riff of ""Milk Moustache"" is one of the few moments on the album where the band kicks up any dust. To be fair, most of these moments fall at the end of Season of Sweets, making for a record with a long, patient build rather than the usual peaks and valleys of standard album pacing. The title track takes off from that momentum with under three minutes of relentless drumming and a guitar part that's more squall than actual notes, yet with all its swagger it remains as sweetly melodic as its namesake. ""Live Like Kids"" is a 10-minute finale-- naturally-- and while its melody is static, they build tension gracefully and purposefully when given the space. As for the tracks preceding it, however, they seem to split the difference between adventurous and cathartic, reaching a middle ground that appeases neither end of the spectrum. It wasn't too long ago that the Modey Lemon had amassed unexpected confidence, but Season of Sweets sounds like a band still in transition.","Three years after The Curious City found them adding psychedelic touches to their garage-rock sound, the latest from Pittsburgh's Modey Lemon is even more ambitious.

Too Old to Die Young,Tall Firs,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc713d197565213b17c/1:1/w_160/e336bfa3.jpg,2008-07-03 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11956-too-old-to-die-young/,Tall Firs,"Tall Firs was an album preoccupied with empty spaces and the sleepy vocals of guitarists Aaron Mullan and Dave Mies. It was both boring and efficient electric folk music, allergic to fuss and incapable of breaking a sweat. So what the hell happened? Drums were never, ever the point. Yet here they are, playing an integral (central?) role on the Brooklyn duo's follow-up, Too Old to Die Young, a record that growls where its predecessor purred, unsettles where it soothed, and generally does whatever it can to make more racket. So this is what the volume knob's for, huh? Of course, adding a force behind the kit can do that to a band. And journeyman Ryan Sawyer has been around the block-- with decibel-adorers like At the Drive In, Celebration, TV on the Radio, Stars Like Fleas, and earplugged into the 62 spot on the Boredoms 77 Boadrum plot. Faced with a résumé like that, what were Mullan and Mies to do but brawn up their yawny folk? So here they are, recasting themselves as a rangy rock band. With feedback and everything. But does it serve them well? On occasion. In the place of Tall Firs' dreary hush, Too Old offers tracks like the adamant lead-single ""So Messed Up"", and the Pavement blotter ""Hairdo"", where Sawyer turns his band into a crew of galvanized indie rockers-- a strange look for a couple of saddos who were supping codeine last time out. But the energy is far from unbecoming, bringing Mullan and Mies out of a self-imposed coma with a couple more BPMs. Then there's ""Warriors"", where the Firs gets downright skin-crazed and wild. Toms patter and cymbals rattle while the guitars do what we never dreamt they could: stir themselves into a mini-furor. But Sawyer's work is a distraction when the songwriters long for their old template. Both ""Hippies"" and ""Blue in the Dark"" are caught between worlds, with warm guitar lines that wouldn't sound out of place on the debut, but with drums that beg to be matched and cathartic outros that come too little, too late. Indeed, the hallmark of this record is a disjointed sort of dynamism, a frustrating lack of cohesion indicative of a band that's still feeling itself out. After all, Sawyer's entree is a game changer. Before, Tall Firs might as well have been Mullan or Mies' solo project, dudes with guitars playing self-contained songs and sounding half asleep. Now, uneven or not, the songs seem to breathe on their own, benefiting from a shot of rhythm and a healthy sweat.","Tall Firs was an album preoccupied with empty spaces and sleepy vocals, but here the Ecstatic Peace group recast themselves as a rangy rock band.

Wishing Well + 5 EP,Love Is All,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc65e6ef95969322cbb/1:1/w_160/d0b84af6.jpg,2008-07-03 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11955-wishing-well-5-ep/,Love Is All,"Back when Sweden took up less of the average indie fan's headphone space-- remember two years ago?-- it was annoyingly common for critics to compare Swedish pop to the Scandinavian country's most famous non-musical exports: IKEA, H&M, Saab. The Swedes aren't much on inspiration, these metaphors (tritely) suggested, but boy are they good at turning others' ideas into safe, efficient, everyday-luxury items. Gothenburg, Sweden's Girlfrendo, whose members would eventually form Love Is All, played Bis- and Kenickie-esque twee-pop almost deserving of the usual Swedish-pop faint praise, but at their best they brought uncommon charm to the role of the lonesome square. When Love Is All arrived, frazzled and frenzied, with 2006's Nine Times That Same Song, they certainly had their precursors-- Life Without Buildings, X-Ray Spex, half of the K Records roster-- but girl-group music had never sounded quite as, for lack of a newer word, punk as it did through that lo-fi looking-glass smudge. Unfortunately, less of what makes Love Is All more than just another stylish yet inexpensive bedroom set could be heard earlier this year on remix compilation Mixed Up, where the same songs that once made us dance, swoon, and spazz out now too many times went nowhere like so much furniture. On their U.S. tour earlier this month, Love Is All started selling a five-song covers CD-R. If Mixed Up had Love Is All's songs hooking up with other artists' styles, the new Wishing Well + 5 EP-- eMusic's variation on the tour CD-R, with a slightly altered track list-- marries the Love Is All style to other people's tunes. The results confirm not only that there is such a thing as a ""Love Is All style,"" but also that, given the right material, it can be a great look. ""Wishing Well"", the disc's opener and sole original track, bodes well for Love Is All's forthcoming sophomore album, expected next year. Like recently posted MySpace demo ""New Beginnings"", this one puts handclaps and male backing vocals behind Josephine Olausson's romantically challenged yips and cries, here perkily bemoaning the futility of superstitions. Like the rest of the tracks on the EP, it was apparently recorded live at practice, which suits this group just fine. Love Is All's din still has within it that Girlfrendo delicacy, and a precarious balance between the two keeps their performances sounding as if they could at any moment go careening into the abyss-- be too cute, too skronky, too much. A cover of the Pastels' ""Nothing to Be Done"" teeters exquisitely on this brink, mussing up the jangle-pop classic with frantic disco hi-hats, honking sax, and a red-lining vocal duet by Olausson and guitarist Nicholaus Sparding. It takes fewer changes than you might think to fill A Flock of Seagulls' glossy new-wave classic ""I Ran (So Far Away)"" with Nine Times' drunken frustration. That same feeling comes across more clearly in a rollicking cover of moddish obscurity ""Fucking Hell"", called ""Golly Gosh"" on the actual CD-R (The original is by Jed Dmochowksi, a UK singer/guitarist who recorded for Television Personalities mainstay Dan Treacy's Whaam! label in the early 1980s). When Love Is All stray further from material that lets them be equal parts Karen O and Aleksandra Campesinos!, the nervous giddiness subsides. They slow down on a cover of Dire Straits' ""So Far Away"", replacing the Brothers in Arms version's palm-muted power chords and Dylan-for-MTV gruffness with sax-led languor, but they'd have been better off fucking up Carole King. ""Kung Fu on the Internet"", salvaged from Glaswegian post-riot-grrl group Lung Leg's 1997 Maid to Minx, is a little too close already to Love Is All's busy-doing-nothing approach; they can obliterate original's ""Batman""-esque riffs, but they can't add the ""emotional content"" the song complains about. Sure, the Wishing Well + 5 EP could've been more interesting if it were + 7, but the ratio of pluses to minuses wouldn't much change. Love Is All's writhing, thrashing ""Darling Nikki""-- on the CD-R but left off the official release, because, well it's a Prince song-- couldn't possibly improve on the Purple Rain hit, so it gets downer and dirtier. An unreleased cover of Faith No More's rap-metal-predicting 1989 smash ""Epic"", is a curio-- a reminder that the original had a Pretty Hate Machine-sized hook and that the Strokes trump Mike Patton when it comes to streching the word ""it"" beyond all meaning. Though ""Darling Nikki"" would've been the EP's chaotic, um, climax, the exclusion of these two tracks doesn't change what Wishing Well + 5 is: a confident lark from a band for whom love is just the start (and pop is nothing like a day at some far-flung furniture warehouse).","Originally available as a tour EP, this collection-- featuring a new track plus remakes of songs by the Pastels, Dire Straits, and A Flock of Seagulls, among others-- is now available digitally.

Singles 06-07,Jay Reatard,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc213d197565213b177/1:1/w_160/ad8e9253.jpg,2008-07-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11952-singles-06-07/,In the RedJay Reatard,"As far as singles compilations go, two years might seem like a pretty narrow window. Then again, just as the two- or three-minute songs from Jay Reatard feel epic, he's given his fans a near-career's worth of riches in that time. It's true that nearly one-third of these tracks are demos and alternate versions of songs from 2006's Blood Visions, but he hasn't rested on his laurels for one moment since then. This compilation is beyond helpful for collecting so many one-off singles, and actually makes for an excellent intro into the world of Reatard for the uninitiated. Anyone who's caught Jay Lindsey and his band live over the past year or so has probably heard ""Night of Broken Glass"": It's a simple but effective juxtaposition that sums up Lindsey's reference points fairly well, from the Devo-brand jerkiness of the verse into one of his most breathless punk-rock choruses. (It speaks to the man's casual approach to history to have what sounds like an empathetic warning song from a guy whose last side project was named the Final Solutions.) Those only familiar with Blood Visions may be surprised by the other tracks from the Night of Broken Glass EP. ""Another Person"" has perky carnival keyboards, stiff new-wave affectations, and sophisticated self-harmonizing, while the foreboding lyrics in ""All Over Again"" are betrayed by a swinging and sweet backing track without a flying-V guitar in sight. ""I Know a Place"" and its B-side, ""Don't Let Him Come Back"", are just as disarmingly gentle, but it further speaks to a songwriter steeped in punk traditions who's absorbed a lot more than his album covers might suggest-- not in the least bands like the Go-Betweens, who originally recorded the deep cut ""Don't Let Him Come Back"" in 1979, with Reatard following suit after Grant McLennan's had passed in 2006. It's a faithful, acoustically driven version marked by Reatard's hiss-soaked multi-tracked vocals, making his lonely yelp into a basement chorus line. ""Hammer I Miss You"" is slow and loopy power-pop that struts rather than races, with a great faraway wail and a guitar part like a downhill snowball for the chorus. But between the staccato full stops of ""All Wasted"" and the screeching vocal of ""It's So Useless"", its B-sides might do the best job of reconciling his former, younger fury with his just-slightly slower punk-pop of late. ""In the Dark"" is one of Reatard's most explicit Wire nods, though it's mid-tempo beat is still infectiously urgent, the single for which also featured two sluggish lo-fi demos of what would be two Blood Visions stand outs, ""Searching For You""  and ""Haunting You"" (which would be renamed ""Nightmares"" and Fading All Away"", respectively-- the promo we reviewed inverted the titles, but both demos are clearly named from key lyrics in each.) Here, they seem to sink underneath the melodrama of the broken relationship they detail; ""Searching for You"" holds up, as it's an uncharacteristically wistful song for Reatard, while ""Haunting You"" doesn't fare as well-- hearing a lyric like ""I won't stop until you're dead"" isn't quite the same without the clattering engine of the band behind it. Those unexpected quirks are more evident on the ""Blood Demos"" 7"" released on Stained Circles. The title track is just as biting as its album counterpart, but its chorus melody is more static and the transition between it and the verses much less smooth, while the juxtaposition of the sterile verses to the careening chorus of ""Turning Blue"" was sacrificed for a more manic and more streamlined approach on the record. That said, there's still something happening here; a sense of melody and purpose that still lifts them above the other exemplary singles from Blood Visions. Letting the seams show a bit with these demos not only reveals a bit about his process, but it illuminates the link between his earlier career and his recent breakthrough, while going a long way to prove that record was more than three or four chords and a fake accent. Song for song, Blood Visions might still outclass this compilation (though this is certainly more diverse), but again, mind those dates at the top: In this short span of time Reatard cranked out more memorable songs then some acts do in their whole careers. If there's a creeping criticism to be had, it's that Jay Reatard solo songs always sound like Jay Reatard, be they slow or fast, quiet or loud, played on synths or guitars. It's a fine line between consistency and stasis that he's toeing, and something to bear in mind as he continues as he continues to record for Matador. For a songwriter hitting this kind of unstoppable stride over the past two years, however, it's a moot point. Whether you watch that DVD or not, it's an era worth celebrating.","A CD/DVD collection of the Memphis punk artist's recent work, there's enough here to attract everyone from fervent fans to neophytes-- even if you should seek out and start with 2006's Blood Visions.

Could We Survive / Crazy Rain / Vagabond Skies / Foreign Girls,Joseph Arthur,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbbcabf31b7dc7155b6a/1:1/w_160/3a617208.jpg,2008-07-02 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11950-could-we-survive-crazy-rain-vagabond-skies-foreign-girls/,Joseph Arthur,"We're barely halfway through the year and Joseph Arthur has already released four EPs, launched a clearing-house mp3 blog called Bag Is Hot, and scheduled a full-length, Temporary People, for September. That tally doesn't even take into account his work as a visual artist working in both photography and painting (collected at his new website Museum of Modern Arthur). Arthur's relentless output-- likely to outstrip the parameters of the word prolific by year's end-- often seems like an outgrowth of his cultivated eccentricity, but there are deep contradictions embedded in his method: Certainly he controls his output completely, as he owns his own label, but his prodigious production implies something more akin to an assembly-line approach to creativity rather than an artist's careful self-editing. Furthermore, flooding the marketplace only dilutes the impact of the work, and in this case listening threatens to become more of an obligation than a pleasure. A deeply idiosyncratic artist, Arthur is nevertheless not an especially innovative singer or songwriter, certainly less so now than earlier in his career, when he was messing with loops and delays, a one-man band creating a strange and provocative racket. There's very little racket on Could We Survive, to its considerable disservice. Tasteful yet never intrusive-- in other words, a bit dull-- the first of these four EPs portrays Arthur as a troubadour-poet musing briefly on life during wartime. With its military snare rolls and Dylan harmonica, the soldier's-eye-view ""Rages of Babylon"" manages to be anti-war, pro-troops, and not a little obvious. His stilted imagery and slightly detached vocals often conflict with the everyman perspective he's attempting to capture, suggesting an artist too far removed from his subject. At least ""Morning Cup"", bolstered by a delicate mandolin phrase, sounds suitably conflicted, suggesting a hopefulness that's all the more poignant for being so precarious. Crazy Rain is more animated, more of a mess, and all the better for it. This is Arthur rocking out with mostly compelling weirdness: ""Killer's Knife"" is all filtered vocals and distorted guitars, ""Nothin' 2 Hide"" all brooding beats and Shaft guitar, yet they're both compelling in their surface pleasures alone, especially after the gravity of Could We Survive. On ""I Wanna Get You Alone"", he shows off a Princely falsetto, nearly inhuman and barely recognizable against the Twilight Singers-style backdrop (a few of that band's members, including Greg Dulli, appear on Crazy Rain). Yet, as much as he seems more attuned to these warped beats, droning guitars, and scribbled synths, he sounds uncomfortable on the glammy ""Radio Euphoria"" and the faux-angry ""I Come Down"". For Arthur, working in the EP format might have been a means to jumpstart his creativity, to think outside his album-a-year box, but there's actually very little experimentation on these songs-- nor much we haven't heard before. Instead, the tactic seems to have reinforced some of his bad habits, such as equating brashness with innovation and using phrases like ""the spaceship in my mind."" The third EP, Vagabond Skies, mixes elements of Could We Survive and Crazy Rain, but not necessarily the good ones. These quiet, electrified songs sound pleasant enough, but indistinctive. Only ""She Paints Me Gold"" and ""Second Sight"" stand out-- and not in a good way-- the former because it features a long, pointless guitar solo (reminiscent of last year's fiasco Let's Just Be) and the latter because it volleys self-consciously between unremarkable verses and shrill, shouted choruses. By the fourth EP, Foreign Girls, Arthur sounds as exhausted as, no doubt, the listener. These songs are almost impressive in their sparkling inconsequentiality. ""Everybody loves foreign girls,"" we're told on ""Foreign Girls"". ""Everybody wants foreign girls."" ""Stay"" seems to exist only for the synth belches on its chorus, ""New Satisfaction"" for its slowed-down psych-rock organ riff. Good elements, but with little underpinning beneath them. Yet the spare arrangement of ""Lovely Cost""-- just voice, guitar, and piano-- sounds genuinely off the cuff, as if Arthur went from idea to execution in the span of a short spring afternoon. Arthur can be compelling or boring, ignorable or annoying, and although the unevenness of these EPs bestows a strange sense of surprise and possibly even discovery, you still have to wade through a lot of crap to find the gold.","These four EPs represent just a part of singer-songwriter Joseph Arthur's output this year-- he's also launched a regularly updated mp3 blog featuring new material and has a full-length on the way. The question, then, is whether he has enough ideas to sustain such a glut of material.

We Were Enchanted,Roommate,by: Stephen M.

""Bring us a virus, unite us in irrational fear/ Bring us a mandate and some band-aids and a six-pack of beer."" Kent Lambert sings those lines on the title track to Roommate's sophomore album, We Were Enchanted. A few tracks later, on ""New Steam"", he invokes the muses, ""Newsman, sing me the blues, man."" In addition to these ostensible references to SARS and Fox News, Lambert also invokes violent video games, haunted McMansions, fluorescent supermarkets, and ""constitutional abuses,"" striving for an of-the-moment gravity that will reflect the dystopia suburban America has become. We Were Enchanted is almost baroque in its topicality, but topicality is easy to achieve. Much harder is knowing what to do with it once you're there. Lambert hoists the same end-of-days anxiety that fueled Don DeLillo's 1985 novel White Noise and Godspeed You! Black Emperor's 1998 debut *F#A#*∞. We've heard the world end this way before, but at the very least, this type of statement album gives the group's expanded line-up a lot to do. On Roommate's 2006 debut, Songs the Animals Taught Us, Lambert played most of the instruments himself, but has since recruited a community of roomies to flesh these songs out with a mix of live instrumentation, drum loops, programmed sounds, and weird shit. They give these songs range: With traces of Ennio Morricone, Jack Nitzsche, Philip Glass, and Pink Floyd-via-Secret Machines, We Were Enchanted sounds more like science fiction-- specifically the zero-gravity prog-rock of Heavy Metal-- than literary fiction or apocalypse rock. That's not such a bad thing, but the music does have to carry what little heft the album has. ""Day After"" opens We Were Enchanted with a clattering of what the liner notes say are ""canjos"" (and which the press release says were made by Chicago high school students). It's an unsettling sound, promising to usher listeners into a strange, threatening world. Sure enough, these songs sprawl and bend themselves into odd shapes. The title track dissolves into an unexpected ""Tubular Bells"" interlude, a brief respite that seems more unsettling than the cacophony around it, at least until Lambert breaks the spell singing, ""Funny monkey, come haunt us again."" On ""Tea Leaves"", a stand-out, the band establishes a Beach Boys pop melody, then deconstruct it in a clatter of drums, guitar, and ""gameboy programming."" Justin Petertil's guitar menaces throughout the album, dogging Lambert's vocals on ""Way Out"" and soloing on ""Last Dreams of Summer"", but generally, the musicians band together like a last-days cult, especially on the sing-along ""Night"", which sounds like the Polyphonic Spree at a funeral. Musically, there are moments of real dread, but the songwriting-- studiously abstract, yet as sensationalized as the blues-singing newsmen-- leavens rather than intensifies that terror. We Were Enchanted makes a whimper, not a bang.","Harnessing the same end-of-days anxiety that fueled Don DeLillo's 1985 novel White Noise and Godspeed You!

I've Got My Eye on You,Syclops,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc113d197565213b174/1:1/w_160/72ecd317.jpg,2008-07-02 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11951-ive-got-my-eye-on-you/,Syclops,"Syclops is a trio featuring Sven Kortehisto, Hanna Sarkari, and Jukka Kantonen, with Maurice Fulton behind the boards, but you could put scare quotes around everything there except Fulton's name. This new DFA ""group"" (see how that works?) doesn't submit to interviews, perform live, manifest any Google results unrelated to Syclops, show up on film, have fingerprints or dental records, etc. Fulton's penchant for relative anonymity explains why a guy who's done remixes and production for Annie, Hot Chip, and Kathy Diamond, and whom is half of Mu, can keep such a low profile. Put it this way: Syclops features the Tin Man on keyboards, the Cowardly Lion on bass, and the Scarecrow on drums, with Maurice Fulton as the Wizard of Sheffield. Pay particular attention to the man behind the curtain. And anyway, who cares about biographical shenanigans when we finally get what's ostensibly a proper solo album from Fulton? If he needs to be left alone to make music this good, we should let him be. I've Got My Eye on You (rim-shot optional) is DFA's second direct-hit entrance this year, a contemplative counterpoint to Hercules and Love Affair's flamboyant debut. The clinically exact robo-funk of early single ""Where's Jason's K"" was almost too polished for its own good, but luckily, the acidy B-side ""Monkey Puss"" (which isn't featured here) turns out to be a better representation of the album proper: It's visceral and lyrical, thumping as jaggedly as a distressed cardio patient's EKG. We might not get ""Monkey Puss"" on I've Got My Eye on You, but we do get ""The Fly"", which features the same kind of strident, Morse code melody, artfully stuttering and ghosting out, interpolated by overdriven bass. It's a bit like French producer Vitalic's jaw-clenching vigor, but where the latter tends to plow down the center, Syclops utilizes every minute degree of stereo channel space. Opening track ""NR17"" traces a labyrinth of pitched percussion and barely audible sub-tones through your headphones, as flying saucers circle ominously; one imagines that Fulton's studio comes equipped with a protractor, compass, and tinfoil hat. These extreme but seamless contrasts-- of physical and synthetic sound sources, hectic and placid moods, tricky and candid patterns-- typify the album. The loping ""5 Out"" splashes sprightly lounge piano over clipped vocal samples and sawtooth synth waves. On ""The E Ticket"", shaggy jazz drums launch a bass workout flecked with crystalline arpeggios and periodic synth washes. ""Mom, the Video Broke"" is sort of a mirror image of ""The E Ticket""-- the latter starts off tight and gradually widens like a cone; the former turns its jazzy percussion into jackhammering mechanical drums as the elongated synth-bass riffs move through fiddly variations. The title track's reverb-brushed percussion verges on musique concrète, at stark odds with the celestial fluff drifting around it, and ""Naoka's F"", with chords radiating through a vast array of torqued pings, chirrs, and blips, feels like the view from an airport's moving walkway-- a respite from harried striding, as busy scenery rolls tranquilly by. Overall, I've Got My Eye on You is the sound of preternatural studio expertise being pressed into the service of the listener's delight. The delicate melodic structures and decorative rhythmic patterns seem to want to please us, rather than just impress us. This befits someone who goes to such lengths to isolate his name and ego from his music, and results in a lot of terrific moments, like when the hushed ambiance of ""A Lovely Sunday"" suddenly lights up with surprising but weirdly apt G-funk whistles. Fulton's bio remains shrouded, but this album tells us that he's a generous and kind of crazily brilliant producer, which is all we really need to know.","Sheffield-based producer Maurice Fulton-- half of the experimental electro outfit Mu, remixer of Annie and Hot Chip, and man of many aliases-- releases a fine solo album on DFA that's filled with rubbery robo-funk.

Running Man: Nike+ Original Run,A-Trak,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbc4abf31b7dc7155b78/1:1/w_160/d9639118.jpg,2008-07-02 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11953-running-man-nike-original-run/,Nike,"Comb through A-Trak's bio and a portrait of preternatural technical skill, sly business acumen, and uncommon idealism emerges. He won the DMC World DJ Championships in 1997, at the age of 15, and he would go on to DJ for Kanye West at the height of his fame. He turned down an opportunity to DJ for Jay-Z on principle, out of loyalty to Kanye (although he would agree to handle musical direction for Hova's tour-- having cake, meet eating cake). Nike's been pretty shrewd in selecting timely, suitable artists for its Nike+ Original Run series, which features continuous mixes designed for exercise, so it's not surprising that they've turned to A-Trak for their latest. Nor is it surprising that his contribution to the series features the same steel-wheel virtuosity, slippery micro-cuts, acrobatic beat shuffling, and block-party swagger that made his Dirty South Dance LP such a blast. What is mildly surprising is that A-Trak regards this as his debut album (he says so twice on the Fool's Gold label website) rather than a one-off thing, which creates some unreasonable expectations for it. A lifestyle accessory with corporately mandated demands (Nike, quite sensibly, dictates the structure and pace of mixes in the series to conform to the physiology of a runner) can't be the kind of balls-out creative manifesto we want from a long-awaited debut. A-Trak's mix essentially includes five distinct movements. After a calling-card warm-up, the beat drops and we get into ""Say Woah"", where a fat, fuzzy caterpillar of a bass line, needling funk guitars, and a hype man's call-and-response get our blood pumping. It ramps up fast: When A-Trak starts slicing up the vocal sample after a brief edit, it's like we've gone straight from mild stretches to full-tilt step aerobics. As the discrete elements of ""Say Woah"" get spliced and juggled with typical dexterity, the pinging Euro techno of the second movement washes in and gets syncopated with squelchy flecks, bass grenades, rubbery rumble-strip synths, and 808 claps. The third section is a slinky, mid-tempo cool-down, with gusts of noir-ish synthetic strings and serviceable club-rap by Fool's Gold artist Kid Cudi (there's a leaked snippet with Lupe Fiasco on the track, but apparently Lupe couldn't be cleared, which perhaps explains why a guy you've probably never heard of says he misses the days when he could walk around in public). Movement four is total choogle, with A-Trak grinding hard on strobe-light synth sequences and revved up splashes of countermelody, and five brings us to an arpeggio-happy finish line. If this sounds all over the place, it kind of is. Maybe it's weird that A-Trak's original productions feel less cohesive than his cuts of other records-- we'll have to wait for an unmediated LP before we can say for sure whether this scattershot feeling is intrinsic to his original work or specific to this project. As far as the whole running thing goes: I ventured out into this hundred-degree summer to give it a shot. It worked fine until the tense yet kinda sluggish Kid Cudi section-- I tried running in slow motion, but it's hard, and the neighbors look at you with pity. So instead of finishing, I had a nice wheat beer with lemon on the porch. I'd like to blame A-Trak, Kid Cudi, Nike-- anyone but myself-- for my truncated run, but that would be unfair, like getting pissed off at MF Doom when you listen to his music and discover you still can't shoot lasers out of your eyes.","The latest entry in the Nike+ Original Run series, which features continuous mixes designed for exercise, is also the first piece of original music from accomplished DJ A-Trak.

Live: Santa Monica '72,David Bowie,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb8ea9e61561daa72de/1:1/w_160/b7e44cfe.jpg,2008-07-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11947-live-santa-monica-72/,Virgin,"It seems quaint now to think that illicitly taped shows were once the record industry's greatest foe. These days bootlegs-- particularly bootlegs like Bowie's October 1972 gig in Santa Monica, which enjoy a degree of fan reputation-- aren't the enemy, they're a blessed revenue stream. Santa Monica '72 has had some level of official release before, but this version is repackaged and unlimited: An opportunity for casual fans to experience what is supposedly the best Bowie show on record. The obvious comparison for Santa Monica '72 is Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture: same tour, but a very different document. That album is David Bowie returning to Britain as a conquering hero (and stunning his fans with his apparent retirement)-- this one finds him far from home and still feeling his way into stardom. The Ziggy look and concept-- the jumpsuit, the shock of red hair, the sci-fi glam rock-- had kicked doors open for Bowie in England, but its impact in the USA hadn't been quite so great. Santa Monica '72 is the sound of a cult act pushing hard for breakout success. Bowie had two big advantages in this push: An exceptional backing band in the Spiders from Mars, and four albums worth of very different material to draw on. The combination let him put on a show that could build and twist to keep its audience riveted. If you're familiar with Motion Picture, you'll know that its slow songs get rather lost in the general end-of-tour bombast, with Mike Garson's piano especially suffering. On Santa Monica '72, though, Garson sounds as intimate and effective as any Spider on a mid-set semi-acoustic section that forms the record's slow-burning highlight. Before that the Spiders set their stall out with a brisk ""Hang on to Yourself"" and a snarling ""Ziggy Stardust"". But ""The Supermen""-- Bowie's unearthly vision of future gods-- is where this album really starts to smolder. The bridge into the show's quieter phase, it's stronger and stranger here than on The Man Who Sold the World, with Bowie's disturbing images and Mick Ronson's blurts of caveman guitar playing compellingly off each other. ""The Supermen"" conjures a sense of uncanny menace that carries the singer through intense takes on ""Five Years"" and ""Life on Mars?"", and ensures ""Space Oddity"" retains some power even when Bowie's doing the take-off noises himself. ""Andy Warhol"" is a standout, closing with a hushed, creepy solo, after which Bowie decides to tell an incomprehensible story about a lobster and a palm tree. The crowd and singer laugh nervously: It's endearing, given Bowie's reputation as a showman and manipulator, how gauche all his stage patter on this disc sounds. Bowie's in-song confidence and command, though, is impeccable. Art-rock credentials proven after a 10-minute ""Width of a Circle"", the show's second half is a thrilling space glam rave-up, the kind that sparked Bowie's early fame. Ronson is very much an equal partner, keeping ""Queen Bitch"" and ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" savage while Bowie brings out their catty catchiness. His guitar lines on ""Moonage Daydream"" prowl all over the song, rescuing it from some deeply unconvincing backing vocals. Not everything Bowie tries on Santa Monica works-- I've never liked his overwrought reading of Jacques Brel's ""My Death"" and even this relatively subdued take doesn't change my mind. And his take on the Velvet Underground's ""Waiting for the Man""-- one of the set's rarities-- is too mannered. But the blistering closing tracks chase doubts from your mind. A fierce ""Suffragette City"" sounds more like the Turbonegro version than the Ziggy one, and the freshly-written ""Jean Genie"" is a revelation, sharp and wide-eyed pop rather than the rote glam exercise it became on record. After an hour's roaming through Bowie's early catalogue, he and the Spiders sound giddy with confidence, up for anything. With bootlegs there's often a danger of confusing rarity with quality: whispered fan legends can wither when exposed to commercial sunlight. But as the man says, the beat it comes out better on a stolen guitar, and Santa Monica '72 earns its fan reputation. This is at once a snapshot of a hungry group on terrific form, and a fascinating look at an emergent star.","Long considered the best David Bowie show on record, this 1972 performance-- which finds the legend still feeling his way into stardom-- gets a 2xCD and vinyl release.

Deltron 3030,Deltron 3030,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95c5e6ef95969322945/1:1/w_160/d8a303da.gif,2008-07-01 05:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2272-deltron-3030/,75 Arkz75 Arkz,"Del tha Funkee Homosapien has, for years, been widely regarded as King of the Oddball Rappers. Lugging the backpack long before there was a codified arty hip-hop scene, Del sneaked onto the radio, clinging by his fingernails to cousin Ice Cube's Chuck Taylor strings. Of course, even his hard-rock relative was befuddled by the Sapien's giddy spirals of abstract, meaningless verbiage. ""Del,"" queried Cube on his oddball cuz's debut, ""What the fuck is a Funkee Homosapien?"" What the fuck, indeed. Del was never shy when it came to flaunting his restless MC intellect, favoring elaborate puns and encyclopedic vocabulary over, like, meaning. The classic example of this, naturally, is Del's first single, 1991's ""Mistadobalina."" The track served as a lengthy put-down on some guy named Mr. Bob Dobalina, about whom very little was clear except that Del found him a little silly. Del has always seemed irritated at having to address the real world, and as such, his best verses are completely divorced from it. For the most part, his last few albums have kept things defiantly surreal, which is great fun, but also chafes the listener. Surely, a lyricist with Del's heavy-duty intelligence has interesting thoughts to share about something other than how cool he and his friends are. It seemed we'd never know... until now. Paired with the Automator, the Kool Keith-embraced-and-scorned poet laureate of creepy, oppressive beats, Del has finally sent himself where he belonged to begin with: outer space. On Deltron 3030, he unravels an album-length narrative about the titular year, in which he's a superhero named Deltron Zero (a plot not entirely dissimilar from that of RZA's Bobby Digital). Armed with his two sidekicks, the Automator (here saddled with the unfortunate sobriquet ""The Cantankerous Captain Aptos"") and scratch mastermind Kid Koala (aka ""Skiznod the Boy Wonder""), Deltron-Z combs the galaxy, supporting his secretive Earthling existence by participating in weird rap battles where one's rhymes summon psychic powers that physically damage the opponent. At least, that's what may be going on. Like most hip-hoperas, there's not much stock placed in narrative coherence here. Fortunately, the plot setup-- delivered by a deliciously, almost impossibly bored-sounding Damon Albarn-- gives way to a loose set of ruminations on a myriad of subjects. Of course, the rap-battle set pieces afford Del plenty of time to lavish attention to his favorite subject: how cool he is in relation to you and any poor soul who would dare challenge his verbal supremacy. But, allowed room to imagine a whole world, many of Deltron 3030's most impressive tracks show our hero exploring a wide-ranging variety of surprisingly weighty topics. The future is imagined from the bottom up: Del lives in a secret lair in the Bay Area, unbothered by exorbitant rents while the world around him falls to pieces. The Earth is run by a select, superwealthy oligarchy who have consigned the underclasses to rot away. (Yes, this is the future.) The environment's in ruins, there's fighting in the streets, and Paul Barman gets a speaking role. In short, things are in bad shape. Such dire straits reveal Del as a surprisingly acute social critic. He even lacks a New York protest MC's frustrating tendency towards self-righteousness, instead favoring targets that actually deserve his wrath: he wants to destroy corporate control and ""convert them to papyrus,"" mostly, and his oppressed underclass is racially diverse. Like the man says, ""It's not about separation/ It's about the population."" He resents the appropriation of hip-hop, but not necessarily by palefaces. He just doesn't like biters because they're messing with the genre's chances of being taken seriously. In the end, that's the most exciting thing about Deltron 3030. Though never self-satisfied or deliberately obscure, the record is an infinite improvement over the wanky verbal gymnastics that currently crowd smug, jerk-off rappers' 12-inches. Though Del may have helped start that trend, here he aches to say something significant. In places-- like the sad, almost Gothic ""Madness,"" the album's masterful centerpiece-- he even succeeds. Now liberated from the obnoxious demands of everyday reality, he's finally found a way to say something meaningful about it.","Del tha Funkee Homosapien has, for years, been widely regarded as King of the Oddball Rappers.

Muting the Noise,Various Artists,by: Andy Battaglia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbafc0084474cd0c28fe/1:1/w_160/b26bd385.jpg,2008-07-01 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11940-muting-the-noise/,Numero Group,"Ever since Brian Eno aligned his epochal album Discreet Music with Erik Satie's call for music that could ""mingle with the sound of knives and forks at dinner,"" ambient music hasn't worried much about change. Eno's rhetorical sally dates back to 1975, and the story since... well, it's not much of a story in and of itself. What has been a story, as the music has bedded down with softness and nuance, is how the ""ambient"" enterprise has come to color everything else around it. Setting aside their considerable beauty, the ambient tracks on Muting the Noise owe part of their impact to how they fit in with the rest of what's going on in electronic dance music. Such is the fate of any ambient album now, it would seem-- especially when the album is compiled by a dance label in Berlin. That's the home of Innervisions, the label run by house heads Dixon and Âme, and the imprint's stable of producers represents their milieu as more than just a cluster of ambient devotees. What makes ambient tracks by Âme and Henrik Schwarz compelling, then, is not just their amorphous atmospheres, but also the ways those atmospheres evoke the kinds of atmospheres that both producers rub down in their more rhythmically antic brands of now-sound house. It would be a mistake to undervalue their considerable beauty, though. If some ambient music is made to be taken for granted, then Âme doesn't help the cause with ""Doldrums"", a gorgeous rush of synth cycles that phase in and out over just the barest hissy suggestion of a beat. Schwarz does it better with ""Arthur"", an intricate piece dotted with a florid piano theme reiterated in different ways and metallic percussion that plays less in measures of rhythmic beats than in timbres of pure sound. Rhythm doesn't figure strongly on Muting the Noise, aside from the sense of momentum gathered in cycles and loops. A few tracks, Karma's and Tokyo Black Star's especially, fall into that propulsively loping realm of ambient scored by Tangerine Dream in Risky Business. (There's many a fantasy of sensuous train travel to be entertained here.) A couple of others skew as noisy in comparison: I:Cube's ""Nuées Ardentes"" hints at ravy sounds while crackling under with dub, while Stefan Goldmann's ""Life After Death"" plays like a moody piece of musique concrète-- all ghostly reed squeaks and test-tones mixed into a disembodied spell. Nothing on Muting the Noise stands to redirect what's thought about ambient music as a project or as an addendum to other sounds, but all of it is measured and ambitious in its way. The only curious standout is the outro by Klaus Schulze. With his stints in Tangerine Dream and Ash Ra Tempel and a sizeable solo career, Schulze is a legend, yes, and his ""Invisible Musik"" covers lots of ground-- but an incongruous running time of 18:08 makes it hard not to at least wonder what happens when ambient steps out beyond its modest means.","Innervisions, the Berlin dance label run by house heads Dixon and Âme, releases its first CD, a compilation with tracks by Klaus Schulze, I:Cube, and Henrik Schwarz that explores how ambient music fits in with the rest of what's going on in the electronic dance scene.

The Outside,Eliot Lipp,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbadc0084474cd0c28f5/1:1/w_160/3d7ea19a.jpg,2008-07-01 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11938-the-outside/,Mush,"Eliot Lipp released his first album via Prefuse 73's Eastern DeVelopments label, where he was something of an odd man out-- in the context of Dabrye's and Daedalus's herky-jerky, obscurantist electro, his own smooth version seemed especially accessible. To my mind, this distinguished him from the more interchangeable contingent of instrumental hip-hop producers: a prototypical Daedalus track is about as sticky as an oil slick, but Lipp's indelibly outsized themes sear themselves into your brain. He's an unabashed crafter of bangers, with none of the stereotypical indie producer's crippling fear of transparency. Lipp's as dependable as ever on The Outside, sequencing analog synths over kinetic breakbeats, and splicing his peripatetic influences-- vintage electro; Krauty Detroit club and Eurocentric filter-swept techno; jazzy undie-hop; brisk G-funk; decadent Sunset Strip glitz-- into anthem after swaggering anthem. The Outside could have easily comprised a continuous double-disc with 2006's Tacoma Mockingbird, except that it mixes up its purebred anthems with some IDM contortions. The uncomfortably titled ""Baby Tank"" refracts pop-industrial through a prism, while ""The Machine and the Wind"" is crystalline ode to sprung clockwork. Lipp's music is catchy because it's repetitive, establishing an infectious melodic theme and grinding on it for three to five minutes. But it's engaging because it behaves unpredictably within this repetition: Lipp vamps on his themes through fugal variations and diverse FX sweeps. In the cosmopolitan jungle of the title track, he smears his robo-funk theme with acid-squelches and chokes it with sundry gargle effects so it whizzes around like a punctured helium balloon over the pimp-strutting low end. The mellower ""Opening Ceremony"" flips the script: here, it's the low end that distends and mutates, while the hovering synth clouds and pinging melody remain relatively constant, beyond the judicious introduction of some tooth-grinding ring modulator effects. Lipp also keeps things lively by occasionally expanding his palette beyond toxic-sunrise Korg tones. ""The Area"" slips needling funk guitar and splashes of piano into its stylized neon squiggles, and ""7 Mile Tunnel"" hurls a delicately sliced voice amid the bumper-car synths. And his tonal range is admirable-- he can go mystical, as on ""Beyond the City"", which deploys trills of revelation (similar to those on Four Tet's recent ""Ribbons') to terrific effect; he can go svelte and simmering, as on ""The Meaning"", whose ground-hugging synths lick and glimmer like small flames. He can flip a bassline so clipped and compressed that it sounds alien, or a bassline so rich and organic it sounds like someone humming. And he can do it all while feeding us exactly the unpretentious heaters we've come to expect from him.","Mush Records' Eliot Lipp is an unabashed crafter of bangers, with none of the stereotypical indie producer's crippling fear of transparency, and he's as dependable as ever on his new album, The Outside.

Focus Level,Endless Boogie,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbae5e6ef95969322c81/1:1/w_160/159eadb4.jpg,2008-07-01 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11939-focus-level/,No Quarter,"The concept that guides Endless Boogie is a relatively simple one: Take the moment at which any good blues-rock jam crests-- the four bars of transcendent face-scrunching and pull-off-laden glory-- then extend that moment onward into oblivion. Focus Level-- the New York City based quartet's first widely available release-- is a choogling zen-prayer, a long-winded invocation to the spirits of Canned Heat, Coloured Balls, and all those who saw the majesty in a pentatonic guitar solo that extended beyond the seven-minute mark. And at 79-minutes long, Focus Level comes about as close to eternity as a compact disc will allow. And that's kind of hard to take in one sitting. Formed in New York in 1997 by selected Matador Records employees and a professional record collector, Endless Boogie practiced for nearly four years before playing their first show-- an opening slot for Stephen Malkmus in 2001. Since then, the band has done small-scale tours with Dungen and the chameleonic Finnish metal group Circle (who are also their No Quarter label mates) as well performing sporadically in their hometown. They've released two limited press 12"" records-- Endless Boogie I and II-- which have at this point vanished forever into the collector scum ether. A hobby band for aging music nerds, Endless Boogie is dangerously low on careerist aspirations. They won't even play a show unless somebody invites them to. For the most part, the music on Focus Level can largely be described with the language one might use for a barbecue chicken recipe-- hooks are slow simmered and gooey, leads are greasy, and the skin is slightly charred. Over the course of 10 minutes, songs like ""The Manly Vibe"" and ""Executive Focus"" work the unexplored (and unexpected) ground between Neu! and Black Oak Arkansas-- carrying hypnotic grooves into tongue-wagging bar-rock abandon with the dueling dollar-bin solos of guitarists Paul Major and Jesper Eklow. Major also enhances the swampy vibe with a stew of bridge troll grunts and growls. ""Tell me why that is/ The paper boy don't come no more,"" he ponders on ""Bad River"", fully capturing the low growl of Captain Beefheart-- and also Dr. Teeth. But the lyrics are just as soon said as forgotten as the band departs on a laid back stroll toward the next guitar solo. Focus Level is rock minimalism at its most casual-- austere repetition and art noise that's good for both the bong-water soaked psych-cognoscenti and the chili cook-off. But if you've seen enough Coors Light commercials, there's a good chance that a large portion of Focus Level will slide beneath your threshold of sensory perception. It's hard to think of a genre of music more ubiquitous than the electric blues, and after hearing more than an hour of Endless Boogie's mellow chugging the music starts to slide, er, out of focus, becoming a dank and yellow aural wallpaper. Their earlier limited press records each served up one monolithic sidelong jam, and then two snack-size portions-- which is closer to the right dose. Given the band's MO-- you know, endlessness-- it's easy to understand how Endless Boogie couldn't pass up the chance to release a double album. The four-sided record is the hallmark of classic-rock over-indulgence, and the extension of that indulgence is Endless Boogie's whole show. But it can be a hard show to sit through.","Though they've been around a decade, Focus Level is the full-length debut by these choogling blues minimalists; true to the band's name, there is plenty of boogie here, and the record also seems to last forever.

The Sun and the Neon Light,Booka Shade,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb0abf31b7dc7155b4c/1:1/w_160/aef93ec3.jpg,2008-07-01 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11941-the-sun-and-the-neon-light/,Get Physical,"It can't be easy being Booka Shade. The Sun and the Neon Light makes their third studio album in three years, in addition to one installment of the mix series DJ-Kicks and numerous EPs, including a collaboration with Hot Chip. Thanks in large part to two of those singles, ""Mandarine Girl"" and ""Body Language"", a collaboration with M.A.N.D.Y. that was deemed Ibiza's 2005 ""Track of the Season,"" they're among the most globally recognized names in an increasingly fractured electronic dance-music scene, and they tour assiduously to support that reputation. The duo's members, Walter Merziger and Arno Kammermeier, also co-direct Get Physical, the label they founded in 2002 along with Thomas Koch (DJ T) and M.A.N.D.Y.'s Patrick Bodmer and Philipp Jung. But it's not just the length of their workweek, nor the fact that their biggest hits are now three years behind them, that must be tiring. It's their ambitions. Despite their roots in club culture, Booka Shade and Get Physical determinedly pursue the home-listening audience as well as the dance floor, at a time when album sales are down and electronic albums are even more of a ""why bother?"" proposition. As much as fans dance at their shows and DJs play their singles, Booka Shade are rare holdouts for grownup electronica, the kind of subtly shaded comfort listening, equally informed by pop and technological play, that has all but disappeared in this decade. The Sun and the Neon Light is certainly their most grown-up album yet: there are fewer obvious singles and more brooding, downtempo moments. While Booka Shade have always been known as a software-centric project-- one of the few acts to be sponsored by a software company, their albums bear the imprimatur of Berlin's Native Instruments, makers of soft-synths like Reaktor and amplifier simulators like Guitar Rig-- they move into the world of ""real instruments"" on this disc, a sure sign of a band intent upon a rather conventional kind of musical maturation. ""Outskirts"" features strings courtesy the German Film Orchestra of Babelsberg; gentle acoustic guitar rustles prominently in ""Solo City""; and there's even a scrap of acoustic blues, a sort of tongue-in-cheek genre cameo, at the center of ""Dusty Boots"". What's curious, then, is that The Sun and the Neon Light feels less lively than any of their previous work, in both mood and sonics. I've always suspected that Booka Shade's reliance on software synthesizers bears some of the responsibility for a certain airlessness in their sound, but that hasn't always worked against them: On tracks like ""Mandarine Girl"" and ""Body Language"", it's precisely the buzzy, pulse-wave sounds that give the music its charge, hovering ominously between euphoria and uncertainty, tinged with a whiff of electrical fire. But this album seems somehow even more cloistered; despite the copious amounts of space in the music-- Booka Shade honed their craft composing music for television advertisements, and they clearly know their way around the studio-- nothing ever seems to really breathe, to open up. I don't mean to privilege one kind of electronic sound over another-- championing ""grit"" in electronic music is often a rockist feint towards specious notions of authenticity, and analog synthesizers and drum machines are not necessarily better than their software-based, ""virtual"" counterparts. But too much of this album feels static, like a hothouse vacuum. That's too bad, because it works at cross-purposes with the duo's obvious goal for this record: With four vocal tracks at its core, it's clearly their attempt at pop crossover. Given their reputation for crowd-pleasing, you'd expect them to do it better. ""Pop"" needn't mean Kylie, of course, and it certainly doesn't here: Booka Shade take their cues from Depeche Mode, from chord changes to sound design, from the vocal stylings to the familiar second-person delivery. The vocal melody of ""Control Me"" is a dead ringer for Depeche Mode's ""World in My Eyes"", while the shuffling ""Psychameleon"" is as indebted to ""Personal Jesus"" as it is to Kompakt's glam-derived Schaffel stomp. The songs aren't bad, but they hardly feel essential; something about their neatly resolving chord changes and their careful balance between controlled noise and mellifluous tastefulness seems self-canceling. They dissolve as soon as they're finished. (The lone exception is the quietly overwrought ""Sweet Lies"", which is pretty bad; fortunately, it dissipates just as quickly.) Two singles, ""Karma Car"" and ""Charlotte"", preceded the album in various club mixes, and it's no coincidence that they're the strongest things here. Booka Shade, fortunately, remain crackerjack composers for the dance floor. ""Charlotte"" expertly juggles a fat, goofy bassline with oodles of squelchy counterpoint lines that spin into a dizzying array of brighter-than-life overtones. (More malleable than all but the most sophisticated of their hardware counterparts, software synthesizers are particularly good at that kind of spine-tingling morphology, and Booka Shade know how to wring every last drop of excitement out of a modulating filter.) I have no idea what they're singing through their vocoders, but here the human element does help to warm up the song; pop and rave in equal measure, the song's a worthy homage to Madchester's madcap spirit. ""Karma Car"" is even better. No matter that it essentially recycles every trick in the Booka Shade playbook-- or maybe precisely for that reason-- it's one of their best tracks yet. Bleepy contrapuntal phrases, clever chord changes that pivot like universal joints, shivering bass-and-treble harmonies that glide in unison up and down the scale-- they're all here, plus some lovely Black Celebration-aping synths, and a baritone chorus that's genuinely hummable. It's tracks like this that keep me interested in the group. But the ability to score hits doesn't equal the capacity for essential longplayers. Ultimately, The Sun and the Neon Light is an unwittingly perfect title for the album, and not only because it conjures the alternating senses of brooding and yearning that their music aims for. What the title describes is just as ineffable as their sound: you can see it coming down, but somehow it fails to leave any tangible impression.","Among the most globally recognized names in an increasingly fractured electronic dance music scene, Booka Shade return with their third studio album, a record that finds them determinedly pursuing the home-listening audience.

Digi Snacks,RZA,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb1eb335119a49ecaca/1:1/w_160/1e291c8b.jpg,2008-07-01 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11942-digi-snacks/,RZA as Bobby Digital,"Most would argue that the differences between Robert Diggs and Bobby Digital are essentially nil beyond the latter wearing a paper-plate mask while in character. Not exactly-- the story told by RZA in the Wu-Tang Manual has one major advantage over the narrative sorta-established by his alter ego over the past decade (!) in that it actually has something of a point to it. Namely, that any time the Wu has been caught slippin', it's because everyone else failed to give RZA the benefit of the doubt. And while it's easy for RZA to claim ownership of 20/20 foresight while trying to do the unprecedented, micromanaging the careers of eight budding superstars, it wasn't until winter of last year where his artistic leadership underwent real scrutiny. While a Wu-Tang project in name, 8 Diagrams was ultimately considered RZA's baby, as the rest of the Clan (most notably Raekwon and Ghostface Killah) wiped their hands of it upon release, slamming the Abbot as a control freak ""hip-hop hippie"" that went behind everyone's back to completely change the character of the record-- a sentiment that gained even more traction after the subsequent drop of Ghost's excellent but cruise-controlled Big Doe Rehab. But the divisiveness was more talked about than practiced-- both records had nearly equal fortunes commercially (none) and critically (almost rote praise). Still, it's easy to see how RZA could piggyback on this situation and garner so much goodwill leading up to his latest solo LP. First off, he didn't come out of that fiasco looking as petty as Ghost and Rae do when they bitch to the media, and while 8 Diagrams wasn't the maverick work of genius some tried to pawn it off as, his sonics did enough to temporarily deflect the fact that half the Clan sounded frighteningly washed-up. More to the point, Bobby Digital is actually a more trustworthy brand name as far as solo albums go-- his first two bows are uneven, but unhinged semi-classics amongst the Wu faithful, while Birth of a Prince (released as RZA) contained tracks like ""We Pop"" and ""Fast Cars"" that have few peers in his discography in terms of sheer awfulness. Yet despite being erudite and lucid in his recent outside pursuits, Digi Snacks finds RZA unable to convey what he really believes, stumbling through mealy-mouthed lyrical and musical ideas before passing the baton to a more engaged but exponentially less interesting subordinate. He's actually become easier to parse-- far less of the ""prominent dominant Islamic Asiatic black Hebrew"" stuff; unfortunately he's a lot harder to understand. Here he's working with about three mismatched cadences at once on ""Booby Trap"", as a grown man going by the name of Dexter Wiggles shouts, ""Zap! It's a booby trap/ Would you like a digi or a Scooby snack?"" Even as someone who thought that ""ears of corn/ And heads of lettuce"" ran on some engine of internal logic, Digi Snacks is unknowable, switching from boilerplate social uplift (""I said, 'damn that's poverty'/ He said, 'that really bothers me'"") to Gods and Earths pillow talk to Wu mythologizing to standard-issue gun talk, all of it bound together by god knows what-- maybe a weird admiration of Jay-Z's The Black Album? It's as good of a guess as any, considering RZA bites the ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"" flow wholesale on ""No Regrets"", and slaps it on a Maths & English leftover starved of air and funds. But I guess we shouldn't go any further before discussing ""Straight Up the Block"", a collaboration with David Banner that makes more sense than it first seems-- after all, both have an aversion to meter and a penchant for dubious political conspiracies. But this attempt at an international player's anthem manages to be the most egregious misuse of talent outside of the Mets-- Banner salvages the beat from Swizz Beatz' scrapyard and then tunes down RZA's voice to the point where his slow grind French (""Je m'appelle Bobby Digi-tell...mademoiselle"") tumbles out of his mouth like broken Slinkys. Advance single ""You Can't Stop Me Now"" gave the impression that we might get a more earthbound, introspective RZA, but it's like ""December 4th"" without those silly interludes-- who hasn't heard this story of his come-up dozens of times? It doesn't help that RZA sounds almost completely uninvested. He could just as easily be reciting from a book, which is technically an improvement over the thudding, bored verse from Inspectah Deck, who might as well be rattling through the Yellow Pages. With that you see the ill effects of the estranged Clan, since Deck's bow is the only one from the A-listers on the entirety of Digi Snacks. After the turbid nightmares of 8 Diagrams, it's no surprise that Digi Snacks is a notably lighter affair, but it just divides RZA's work between a pop audience that never really wanted him and the hardcore Wu heads who think ""Tearz"" is as soft as they should ever get. ""Good Night"" revives the waterbed motion of ""My Lovin' Is Digi"" better than the eponymous sequel, mostly because it's still entertaining to hear didactic rhymes about sinking one's ""Titantic"" (sic) into your Atlantic and the boundless verbal elasticity needed to fit ""Chicago,"" ""Virgo,"" and ""convertible"" in the same rhyme pattern. If anything, Digi Snacks managed to pinpoint where we are in the Wu cycle of life. In 1998, hip-hop was flush with enough cash to possibly sustain a Bobby Digital movie and now, low-overhead labels like Koch ratchet down expectations to the point where it can be pursued as the niche project it always was. But ""half-baked"" isn't an improvement over ""raw"" for a guy like RZA, and anyone who's heard a recent Kool Keith record can tell you that an astounding catalog, reality-defying self-confidence and an otherworldly alias can't restore rapidly dwindling goodwill on its own. Things just ain't the same for quasi-mad scientist/ghetto philosopher/sexual dynamo superheroes.","After the turbid nightmares of Wu-Tang's 8 Diagrams, it's no surprise that RZA's follow-up is a notably lighter affair, a record that divides his work between a could-be pop audience and the hardcore Wu heads.

As it stands, the album's eleven tracks dabble in Guthrie picking, Kottke alchemy, and even a bit of Ogurusu Norihide quietude. But you have to strain to notice the fanning of styles. What Nomura forces the listener to pay attention to, almost exclusively, is his words-- the presumably put-on ESL awkwardness, childlike nonsense, and whimsy he scatters atop his pieces. Sure, defend all you want, but whether or not the Japanese expat is employing a shtick, songs about dead birds, retarded dogs, and tomatoes simply feel contrived. Of course, when he's lucky enough to find a convincing sentiment, the wide-eyed innocent thing actually works. ""It's Okay""'s warm refrain of ""It's okay to be yourself, because you are you""-- currently soundtracking an eSurance ad-- opens the album brilliantly, making an impact with a sort of ""duh"" wisdom. Likewise, when Nomura sings of falling for an unattractive girl on ""Alma Song"", there's something endearing in his clueless bluntness. But such qualities don't make it into clunkers like the straight-jacketed ""Heaven, Dog, and Rainbow"", or ""Let Me Teach You How to Hold Chopsticks"", a whacked pop number about teaching a girl to hold chopsticks, and not beating her up because she's pretty. Strangely (or maybe predictably), abuse is a theme that emerges several times throughout. Especially on the lengthy ""Soft Boy"", a semi-narrative about a soured romance told from the perspective of a female. ""I've been waiting,"" sings the spurned protagonist, hovering over her cell phone. ""Hit me back, hit me back, hit me back, hit me back, or just hit me, like you used to do."" The fact that it's Nomura's stab at a compelling narrative (and not a non sequitur-laced vignette about losing your keys or roadkilled cats) helps the song climb to the top of the heap here. Indeed, it's the only instance in which Nomura pulls off the damaged weirdo bit successfully, and ironically, the most austere moment on this seriously strange record.","A seriously strange indie pop record from a Brooklyn-based Japanese expatriate-- his music is currently soundtracking an eSurance ad-- that finds skilled acoustic fingerpicking married to puzzling lyrics.

The Best of Bobby Womack: The Soul Years,Bobby Womack,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba95e6ef95969322c73/1:1/w_160/82b9920b.jpg,2008-06-27 05:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11935-the-best-of-bobby-womack-the-soul-years/,Capitol,"Bobby Womack had an A-list pedigree, relatively enormous success as a songwriter, and a long string of respectable-or-better r&b hits, and he's still sort of an also-ran. A journeyman soul singer, Womack scored 26 chart singles in the 1968-1976 period documented here, but he rarely seems to turn up on, say, oldies radio. He first recorded in the early 60s as part of the gospel act the Womack Brothers, who promptly followed their mentor Sam Cooke's example and went secular as the Valentinos. Later on, he married Cooke's widow (which supposedly got him blacklisted on radio for a few years), wrote a bunch of hits for Wilson Pickett and others, played guitar on records including Sly Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On and Aretha Franklin's Lady Soul, and returned to the charts under his own name in 1968. Weirdly enough, given his songwriting credibility, Womack spent a good chunk of this era funking up the least soulful pop hits he could find: His first solo hit was ""Fly Me to the Moon"", and he followed that up with ""California Dreamin'"", ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"", and ""Fire and Rain""; his ""Sweet Caroline"" doesn't show up here, but it charted too. Even so, he barely seems to pay attention to those songs themselves: they're all about showing off how impressive his pipes are. (The backing musicians are, unsurprisingly, not credited here either.) He kept dipping back into his older repertoire, too. A 1975 duet with Bill Withers is a remake of the Valentinos-era ""It's All Over Now"", which the Rolling Stones covered for their first British #1 hit in 1964; there's also a 1973 remake of the Valentinos' other hit, ""Lookin' for a Love"", from an album called Lookin' for a Love Again. That title says something about the general sense of commercial desperation on display here; the remake went to the top of the r&b charts, which says something about how desperation moves can pay off if they're executed gracefully enough. The Soul Years is a solid compilation of Womack's hits, sequenced for vibe rather than chronology (although it ignores the fact that his chart career didn't end in 1976; he released three Top 5 r&b albums between 1981 and 1985, and continued to bat at the lower regions of the r&b singles chart for years after that). Put it on at a party and it'll keep everyone happy. But even at his best, Womack was reliable rather than magnificent, a craftsman rather than an innovator. Nearly all of these songs see him skillfully following up on somebody else's bright ideas. Some of those ideas stuck with him for a long time: all over The Soul Years, you can hear little vocal tricks he picked up from Sam Cooke. ""Across 110th Street"" is Curtis Mayfield-style blaxploitation funk; ""You're Welcome, Stop on By"" is a trip into Marvin Gaye territory; a couple of recitative-into-song numbers cop their moves from Clarence Carter and Isaac Hayes. The collection's highlight, ""The Preacher/More Than I Can Stand"", in which he sermonizes onstage on the subject of cheatin' for a few minutes until the band dramatically kicks in, suggests the improvisational force he developed as a touring gospel singer. What salvages a lot of these songs, and maybe even what buoyed them up the charts, is that Womack's clearly (and deservedly) in love with the grit and honey of his own voice-- he called his autobiography Midnight Mover: The True Story of the Greatest Soul Singer in the World. Virtually all of them are fine examples of the r&b of their era; scarcely any of them offer something that wasn't done better by somebody else.","A solid compilation of Bobby Womack's hits, sequenced for vibe rather than chronology, this record focuses on Womack the singer at the expense of Womack the songwriter.

Huffin' Rag Blues,Nurse With Wound,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbaaeb335119a49ecaba/1:1/w_160/1dedac9d.jpg,2008-06-27 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11936-huffin-rag-blues/,Jnana,"If Nurse With Wound means anything more to you than ""that band that takes up a whole browser in the 'Industrial/Goth' section of my local record store,"" chances are they inhabit a strange place in your collection. Equally indefinable and uncollectible, Steve Stapleton's Nurse With Wound have spent the past 30 or so years crafting what sounds like indigenous music for household appliances. That Stapleton's latest, Huffin' Rag Blues, has dropped with a silent, drone-y thud even amongst out-music fans is no real surprise, as even NWW cultists aren't starved for material (e.g. 2005's decidedly under-considered Angry Eelectric Finger is receiving a double CD/photo book addendum). Huffin' Rag Blues, a collaboration with, among others, experimental sound artist Andrew Liles, extends Stapleton's exploration of the bizarre and arcane via tricks like obscure and disorienting samples and minimal industrial noise-- this time juxtaposed against bop and swing music. Huffin' Rag Blues' nods to big band and jazz-- as well as its appropriations of linear, identifiable grooves-- suggests NWW's 1996 question Who Can I Turn to Stereo? might be Stapleton literally asking his boombox for answers (rather than casually pondering who he can transmogrify into a Sony). The aborted album-opening story of ""Willy the Weeper"", a chimney sweep with a dope problem, starts with a januty accompaniment, and is followed by ""Groove Grease (Hot Catz)"" and a lounge organ that surprisingly isn't overrun with angsty noise-niblets until its final minute. ""Thrill of Romance…?"" sets a pulsing horn and spindly Latin guitar work under Freida Abtan's vocals, which sort of sound like Kim Gordon doing standards. ""Cruisin' for a Bruisin'"" rolls a bass-y horn bauble over careening car noises, the noir of Sin City interpreted as roly-poly funk. Unfortunately, most of Huffin' Rag Blues is spent accomplishing something most albums this singular and creative couldn't imagine: boredom. Stapleton has ideas for miles but the speedometer's fucked. ""Wash the Dust From My Heart"" is a straight-played jazz homage replete with a walking bassline and careful xylophone vibes; that it contains occasional ambient interruption does not distract from its six-minute runtime. ""Advance single"" (ha!) ""Ketamineaphonia"" opens with a snippet of ballpark organ before settling into five minutes of hapless beat instruction and slight orchestral breaks. ""Black Teeth"" inconceivably bats around Captain Beefheart congo-skronk, allowing Matt Waldron ample room for a sub-drug conversation between Satan and, um, a man that wouldn't have made the cut of a third-grade puppet show (""And Satan says 'Here comes a storm/ Get off the bus' and the Man says 'Shutup Satan/ Satan shutup' and Satan says ""Here comes another stop/ Get your fat ass off the bus'""). ""Juice Head Crazy Lady"" and ""The Funktion of the Hairy Egg"" are the most classically NWW tracks here, and while the former sounds inspiringly deranged for four minutes, ""Hairy Egg"" stands as a 14-minute behemoth mercilessly sequenced in the three-hole, eventually devolving-- predictably, somehow-- into a cacophony of barnyard noise. Huffin' Rag Blues should probably get points for distinguishing itself from the endless string of NWW releases. The cover art-- pressed in a glossy digipak with colors other than black and photos suggesting things other than sadistic sex-- basically assures as much. Stapleton's complained in the past about his releases floating into the ether, but Huffin' Rag Blues, inspired and deeply flawed, deserves both your consideration and your dismissal. Stapleton's tireless mind merits as much; he was probably right to bitch. And if Huffin' Rag Blues isn't wtf/""Things done changed""/NWW on Demand enough for you, take heart: that Angry Eelectric Finger addendum is eligible for free shipping with Amazon Prime.","Steve Stapleton's Nurse With Wound have spent the past 30 or so years crafting what sounds like indigenous music for household appliances, and here they explore the bizarre and arcane with help from bop and swing music.

Kleerup,Kleerup,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb58c0084474cd0c282b/1:1/w_160/8432a509.jpeg,2008-06-27 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11581-kleerup/,EMI,"Before you waste any more precious eyeball moisture on this record review, stop and look at that face. Framed by stringy, grunge-rock hair, it's the face of Stockholm's Andreas Kleerup, already one of the most internationally successful players involved in Sweden's current reign as global pop incubator. Perhaps unlike, say, Robyn, Peter Bjorn and John, ex-Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman, or Jens Lekman, you probably don't recognize him-- by name or by face. All right, then. That's why they call this an introduction. If you know Kleerup already, you probably first heard about him as producer of Robyn's 2006 single ""With Every Heartbeat"", an orchestral electropop ballad full of soulful melodies and the queasy emotional conflict of a breakup that hurts every bit as much as you know it's right. Re-released last year in the UK, the song went to the top of the charts, and the new U.S. single has done well on domestic dance and singles sales charts this year as well. After the Robyn coup came remixes for Shout Out Louds, the Concretes, and others, along with a collaboration on the latest Cyndi Lauper album (seriously). Kleerup's self-titled album-- currently import-only outside of Sweden-- marks his solo debut, though he has appeared on a few scattered releases (including a remix of the Tough Alliance) as a member of an electropop trio called the Meat Boys. The CD booklet offers seven more portraits of the artist's unsmiling face, each about the same except for different color schemes or shadows. The album itself puts Kleerup's best face forward, featuring ""With Every Heartbeat"" plus 11 other home-recorded songs; aside from several completely solo excursions, the tracks stay pretty much within the same computer-plus-Swedish-chanteuse template. Good thing it's an enjoyable template. ""With Every Heartbeat"" still sounds devastating here, and the other collaborations take a similarly lovelorn path. The best is ""Until We Bleed"", with up-and-comer Lykke Li, which again relies on strings and a house beat, this time with frazzled synths coaxing out the volatility that distinguishes Li from her peers. It's as good an introduction to the singer as anything on her estimable, Bjorn Yttling-produced debut, Youth Novels. The Concretes' Lisa Milberg brings the gentle anguish and pop-oriented lyrics of her group's latest, Hey Trouble, to ""Music for Girl"", which sounds like the Knife doing Motown: ""The songs, you know, they never leave you for another."" Closer to the Robyn track's bright expressiveness are lonesome, Italo-tinged comedown ""3AM"", with Marit Bergman (who has also been produced by Yttling, including on a 2002 debut titled 3.00 A.M. Serenades) and Titiyo-sung second single ""Longing for Lullabies"". Titiyo's older sister, none other than Neneh Cherry, strikes a vague, awkwardly worded political stance on children's choir-assisted ""Forever"", though her smoky voice still resonates. Kleerup's tracks without guests are the real revelation. ""Thank You for Nothing"" is another standout, with the producer's own wounded vocal repeating within whirring beats. ""On My Own Again"" takes a peppy John Hughes-film left turn, with the cheeriest synths on the album and ramshackle acoustic guitars. The instrumentals-- from hard-charging, Simian Mobile Disco-esque opener ""Hero"" to fragile, ambient-leaning finale ""I Just Want to Make That Sad Boy Smile""-- don't break the momentum. Look at that album cover again. Yep, it's the face of a guy who just recorded an accomplished, cohesive debut, one that should please fans of ""blog house"" and Swedish pop alike. Now if only he owned a razor.","After coming to prominence as the producer of Robyn's UK #1 ""With Every Heartbeat"", Kleerup unveils his debut LP, with assistance from Lykke Li, Marit Bergman, the Concretes' Lisa Milberg and Neneh Cherry's baby sister, Titiyo.

Feed the Animals,Girl Talk,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbab13d197565213b146/1:1/w_160/bb9cd6c9.jpg,2008-06-27 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11937-feed-the-animals/,Illegal Art,"As I was finishing an interview with Gregg Gillis in July 2006, he casually mentioned his desire to see M. Night Shyamalan's just-released fantasy movie Lady in the Water. Given the film's wretched reviews-- a pitiful 24% on Rotten Tomatoes-- and the train-wreck hype surrounding it, I thought he was kidding. He wasn't; Gillis liked some of Shyamalan's other flicks, so he wanted to check this one out. Simple. And it's this omnivorous, pleasure-seeking attitude toward pop culture that defines his work as Girl Talk. (Luckily, his taste in music is superior to his taste in film.) Unlike mash-up makers in it to figure out the lamest way to combine two song titles, justify their existence with cheap mp3 blog Diggs, or wind up in a Cobrasnake shot with some Olsen twin look-a-like, Gillis just really likes stuffing tons of his favorite FM moments into bursts of Top 40 overload. ""I'm a pop music enthusiast,"" he told me. Hailing from the anti-flash city of Pittsburgh, Gillis has sidestepped the Absolut-sponsored stigma associated with of-the-moment party starters ever since 2006's Night Ripper sent him on a never-ending tour of sweat-stained clubs. While his live set changes with the ebb and flow of the Hot 100, this is Gillis' first major release as a semi-popular act. Unsurprisingly, his new record, Feed the Animals, comes off like the ultimate July 4th rooftop soundtrack. Seems like those stage-crashing dates made the unassuming former biomedical engineer even more eager to indulge his hungry followers. As the recognizable samples zip by at a dizzying clip, it's as if Gillis is standing tall above the fray, screaming: ""Are you not entertained?!"" Even with pop's long tail extending with each passing year, there are still new trends that recall the days when hits were hits and major labels ruled the world. While Gillis' pile-on sampling style isn't new (see: Paul's Boutique, DJ Z-Trip, the Avalanches, 2 Many DJ's, et. al), its confluence of shamelessness and abundance is unparalleled. For all its forward thinking, Feed the Animals has an old-school bent. First thing: It's an album. Many of Gillis' contemporaries couldn't be bothered with such an outdated concept, but by choosing the LP route-- instead of, say, a monthly series of hit-blending MP3s-- he's outing his traditionalist tendencies. Gillis is not just trying to just tide his fans over until the next show here, he's trying to give them something to anticipate at the next show. Which brings us to the Three Stages of Girl Talk: knee-jerk recognition, easy-to-swallow consumption, and, finally, cemented recontextualization. When people go apeshit for his famous Biggie-Elton John pairing, they're taking pleasure in their own memories, the room's collective memory, the indisputable greatness of ""Juicy"" and ""Tiny Dancer"", and, possibly above all else, they're cheering for the Girl Talk song that combines all those things so seamlessly. In concert, these mental synapses pop at the same time, and the result is thrilling-- the apotheosis of the Girl Talk experience. Feed the Animals offers a new round of associative concoctions ready to blow out clubs this summer and beyond. Perhaps in an effort to work his crowd up quicker and more efficiently, Gillis spikes his signature mix of current smashes, hip-hop, 1980s pop, 90s alternative, and classic rock with a slew of wedding-ready staples. There's a reason why every bar mitzvah DJ has Earth, Wind & Fire's ""September"" in their jam bag and, when it's coupled with Ludacris' pitch-shifted verse from Fergie's ""Glamorous"", it slays. Similarly, snippets from the Jackson 5, the Spinners, and a decent chunk of ""Whoomp! (There It Is)"" provide instant, natural highs. Several of Night Ripper's best moments had Gillis unlocking the vulnerability of roughneck rap verses with relatively somber backing tracks, and Feed the Animals continues with these hard-soft moments. Lil Wayne gets the treatment twice: first when his ""Stuntin' Like My Daddy"" verse (""where I'm from we see a fuckin' dead body everyday"") is put over top the ageless ""Nothing Compares 2 U"", and then when the hook to ""Lollipop"" is backed by ""Under the Bridge""-- apart from some pitch issues, the latter's perfect fit is uncanny. The more typical juxtapositions are predictably hit (Lil Mama pushing shiny lips over Metallica's ""One"") and miss (Jay-Z's ""Roc Boys (And the Winner Is...)"" boasts are miniaturized by Radiohead's ""Paranoid Android""), and the classic rock inclusions have a way of derailing the mix's meticulous r&b/dance flow. But that's the beauty of Girl Talk-- if you hit a lackluster patch, it's over before you can say the Band vs. Yung Joc. Feed the Animals helps to solidify Gillis' role as the supreme 80s-baby pop synthesizer. And while others have attempted to claw up to his lofty position, no one has managed to match his unique mix of diversity, pace, and open-mindedness-- not to mention his exquisite ear for snagging the best 15 seconds of every three-minute track blaring from your clock radio. He's post-modern, post-guilty pleasure, and post-lawsuit (maybe). ""The whole basis of the music is that people have these emotional attachments to these songs,"" he told me. ""Being able to manipulate that is a really easy way to connect with people."" Easy for him; good for us.","Girl Talk's 2006 LP Night Ripper made him the of-the-moment party starter, and now his first major release as a semi-popular act-- another confluence of shameless thrills and near-overwhelming abundance-- comes off like the ultimate July 4th rooftop soundtrack.

Fern Knight,Fern Knight,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba45e6ef95969322c69/1:1/w_160/00607b9c.jpeg,2008-06-26 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11930-fern-knight/,VHF,"Since the early part of the decade, singer and multi-instrumentalist Margaret Wienk has been firmly entangled within the twisting vines of Philadelphia's prolific psych-folk community. Along the way she has recorded with such luminaries as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, Espers, Damon and Naomi, and Philly's cult-soundtrack troupe The Valerie Project. But her primary vehicle as a singer and songwriter has been Fern Knight, a folk-rock quartet whose debut album Seven Years of Severed Limbs first appeared in 2003. In the time since then, Wienk's songwriting has grown increasingly pastoral and gothic, and with their eponymous third album, Fern Knight now can sound as if they are in deliberate retreat from our current millennium. Philadelphia's communal folk scene has been so vibrant that it has become that much more difficult for individual talents to distinguish themselves. This has especially been the case for Fern Knight, as Wienk and her group so clearly share a sensibility and common pool of folk influences with Espers. This affinity is further heightened on Fern Knight by the involvement of Espers' Greg Weeks-- an omnipresent figure where Philly psych-folk is concerned-- who helped produce the album and contributes some guest backing vocals. As with Espers, the music of Fern Knight echoes the spirit and atmosphere of any number of obscure 1970s British folk-rock acts while managing to not sound specifically like any one in particular. The closest ancestors to their sound might be early Steeleye Span, who made similar use of violin and guitar pairings, and the darker orchestrations of such vintage underground acts as Comus or Oberon. Though these rather musty influences risk turning Fern Knight into something of a restoration piece, the album succeeds in large part due to Wienk's classical roots and her innate melodic instincts. The album fairly overflows with images of greenery and the natural world, as Wienk's lyrics abound with fiddlehead ferns, waves of seafoam, various forest critters, and romantic beds of pine needles and moss. Throughout the album, however, a dark undercurrent of trouble and dissonance lurks beneath these deceptively placid idylls. On the opening ""Bemused"" the group's subtle washes of cymbal, harp, and acid guitar loom like ominous thunderheads, while James Wolf's violin provides a spot-on melancholic tug to the lovely, haiku-like ""Hawk Mountain"". Predictably enough, these dark tides eventually draw Fern Knight in a progressively apocalyptic direction, and-- with a nod to hallowed psych-folk tradition-- does so in the form of a song suite. Lofty aspirations aside, the album closing three-part ""Magpie Suite"" results in some of the group's most sumptuous and satisfying work to date. (The piece even opens with a lyrical reference to Milton's Paradise Lost just in case you might otherwise underestimate the gravity of the situation.) In a form that owes as much to chamber music as to folk, this elegiac suite layers cello, violin, and harp beneath the overlapping vocals of Wienk and Weeks before cycling to a lovely, Baroque choral finish that points hopefully toward the prospect of rebirth and a new dawning. Needless to say, some of Fern Knight's anachronistic details will require a certain level of tolerance that some more temporally grounded listeners might lack. (Personally I wish that Wienk and Weeks had opted to use fewer spacey echo effects on her otherwise crystalline vocals.) But throughout the album, glimmers of invention and humor are allowed to shine through, such as on the wry ""Synge's Chair"". What sounds on the surface to be yet another somber treatment of a traditional folk dirge instead reveals itself to be a comic Irish travelogue. As the song details their journey, a group of travelers give up their search for the elusive Synge's Chair landmark and instead go have a drink in a bar, returning at last to the present and to those traditions that should be relatable to all listeners.","Sharing a sensibility and common pool of folk influences with fellow Philly natives Espers (whose Greg Weeks also produces here), Fern Knight still manage to distinguish themselves with their classical roots and innate melodic instincts.

Time Traveller,Plantlife,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba513d197565213b134/1:1/w_160/11ee91a4.jpg,2008-06-26 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11931-time-traveller/,Decon,"The title track that opens this album is kinda funny: As a minimalistic click-track/electric piano composition murmurs away behind him, a pitched-up Mr. Wiggles/Quasimoto voice claims to have a hand in dozens of pivotal moments in rap, funk, and rock history, sort of like a more benevolent b-boy geek-out version of ""Sympathy for the Devil"" (""I had Melle Mel's back when he was by the edge/ I used to wear them big suits with the Talking Heads""). It's cute and all, but it's also a bit of misdirection: most of the names dropped in this track belong to hip-hop artists, yet for all the invocations of rap icons from Bambaataa to Dre to Dilla, Plantlife's Time Traveller sounds a lot more like a record informed by those artists' production influences rather than the artists themselves-- a second cousin to hip-hop, once removed. And if that cartoon spaceman voice stops short of admitting he was there when Prince decided to start wearing purple, the rest of the record spends a good deal of time proving it. If the paisley vibe hasn't hit you after reading the tracklist (""Agirllikeudeservesamanwhotreatsuhowulike""; ""Got 2 Find a Better Way""; ""Fool for U""), it probably will after the dirty-minded heavy ballad ""Don't Go Around Looking for a Broken Heart"" and the panting, guitar-driven come-on of ""Lovetoy"" (""Sexy girl, I wanna be your lover boy/ Sexy girl, I wanna be your lovetoy""). And if lead singer/producer Jack Splash doesn't have Prince's vocal range-- he mostly sticks to a somewhat raspy falsetto, which is engagingly dizzy enough to help you ignore how one-dimensional it is-- he definitely has the baby-I'm-a-star routine down. And judging from the darkly comic references to ego tripping and loveless sex in ""They Pay Me 4 This (Typqlsupastar)"", he knows how to subvert it as well. But on the whole the album's more in the spirit of 1999's omnivorous r&b than a full-fledged knockoff of it, and there're plenty of other familiar funk touchstones all over its DayGlo surface-- P-Funk, Zapp, the Ohio Players, Rick James-- to give it a broader personality that isn't derivative of much else aside from a certain wide-spanning era. The music on Time Traveller is a bit more postmodern and outlandish than the neo-soul production and session work Splash has done for the likes of John Legend and Estelle, ranging from modernized Sly & the Family Stone-esque rave-ups (""Outta Control"") to sleek roller-disco (""Rollerskate Jam"") to semi-Latin yacht-soul (""Sun Shines Through Your Love"") to a guitar-drenched closing slow jam Shuggie Otis would envy (""Fool for U""). What it lacks in a unified style it makes up for in a referential (and reverential) enthusiasm that anyone with a subscription to Wax Poetics should recognize as an individualized, well-crafted love letter to funk gone by-- and funk yet to come.","Plantlife lead singer/producer Jack Splash draws from Prince, P-Funk, the Ohio Players, and Rick James on a well-crafted love letter to funk.

Fire Songs,The Watson Twins,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba613d197565213b137/1:1/w_160/cc5f27d6.jpg,2008-06-26 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11932-fire-songs/,Vanguard,"The Watson Twins certainly can't claim to lack models for making distinctive Cali-lite country-pop in the 21st century. Chandra and Leigh's voices and surname adorned Jenny Lewis' 2006 album, Rabbit Fur Coat, an intensely individual document of a boho-celeb's passage through adulthood that found its creator wrestling fearlessly with faith, sex, and all the other things that nag at a maturing heart. Lewis' record may not have been musically adventurous, but her self-aware smarts allowed the Rilo Kiley frontwoman to overcome the typically pale strictures of alt-country and produce the best work of her career.
 
Lewis' twin harmonizers tread the same politely restrained sonic path on their debut full-length, Fire Songs. Unfortunately, the Watson Twins don't possess Lewis' lyrical or performative presence, and all too often their words and melodies fail at even the modest task of standing out from such innocuous landscapes. Calling it coffeehouse music would actually be a correct application of an oft-misused pejorative. It's bullshit to label the work of fierce women like Lewis, Kathleen Edwards, and Martha Wainwright thusly, but in the case of the Watson Twins the soft-soled shoe truly fits.
 
Within a certain very unobtrusive framework, Fire Songs is, truth be told, pretty musically solid. ""How Am I to Be"" kicks things off with a nice Motown-ish vibe, while ""Map to Where You Are"" is spiced with some nifty Mexican horns. The occasionally rambling, ruminative bent of the album's guitars (particularly on ""Dig a Little Deeper"" and ""Sky Open Up"") point to the influences of the Grateful Dead and Neil Young (the girls covered the latter's ""Powderfinger"" for a charity comp earlier this year). Hardly stretching, sure, but you couldn't accuse Fire Songs of being utterly undifferentiated either.
 
That the Watson Twins blend seamlessly into these backdrops, however, is far from a compliment. Of course it's lovely to an extent when the girls harmonize, but neither owns a voice strong enough to convey much besides a languid aridity. And it's not as though their softly-sung words carry quiet bite either-- mostly these lyrics are either unmemorably nebulous or else ring generically false, like the hard-drinking set-up of ""Bar Woman Blues"", the image in ""Lady Love Me"" of ""those bruises you still have on your arm"" or the gently cooed suggestion on ""Old Ways"" that ""you're always on fire."" The noteworthy exception is ""Only You"", which momentarily dispenses with generalities and presents a genuinely nuanced portrayal of the selfishness inherent in love.
 
Far more emblematic of the Watson Twins' approach is their limp cover of the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", which robs the song of all its giddy desperation, replacing it with something that aims for ache but ends up settling for a mere freeze-dried prettiness. You get the sense they could perform the same service with any source material-- the Ramones, ABBA, Slayer, all rendered sleepily sweet.","On their debut full-length, Jenny Lewis' harmonizers tread the same politely restrained sonic path as the three did on the 2006 album Rabbit Fur Coat.

No Way Down EP,Air France,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba7c0084474cd0c28e8/1:1/w_160/58a97367.jpg,2008-06-26 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11933-no-way-down-ep/,Sincerely Yours,"Gothenburg, located on the west coast of Sweden, averages highs in the upper 60s in June; in recent years, however, the city has produced some of the sunniest music in the world. Tropical rhythms and warm-weather themes color releases by Jens Lekman, the Tough Alliance, Studio, and the Embassy-- all of whom have recorded for Gothenburg-based label Service. TTA and Studio have since founded their own labels, each with its own cryptic website. Signed to TTA's Sincerely Yours, Air France invited listeners to their ""Beach Party"" with last year's too-good-to-be-true On Trade Winds EP. Air France's latest, the 23-minute No Way Down EP, is better. The seaside disco of the Gothenburg groups shares many traits with the DJ-ing style named after the Balearic archipelago, off the coast of Spain. Dreamed up on the Balearic island of Ibiza by Argentina-born DJ Alfredo Fiorito in the mid-1980s and soon brought to London, the sound spanned laid-back, groove-oriented music ranging from conga-accented Italo disco and the iridescent proto-techno of Manuel Göttsching's classic E2-E4 to hypnotic indie rock by the Woodentops and offbeat selections from soft-rock, prog, and global pop music. As a DJ-centered art, Balearic house was inherently based on manipulations of other people's music. Balearic is far from the only musical perspective that can unite an eclectic variety of records without regard to genre or historical context. As the KLF observed in their book The Manual: How to Have a Number One the Easy Way, ""All records in the Top 10 (especially those that get to #1) have far more in common with each other than with whatever genre they have developed from or sprung out of."" That's true from ""Take Five"" to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". What distinguishes the music of Air France and their Sincerely Yours colleagues from the more rock- and groove-oriented sounds of Studio or Norwegian cosmic disco DJs like Lindstrøm, Prins Thomas, and Todd Terje is that they've taken to heart not only Balearic, but also the teachings of chart pop. Air France use elements of both Balearic and pop to create their sumptuous, sincere fantasy world. In that respect, Air France's No Way Down-- currently import-only outside of Sweden except as 320 kbps mp3s-- is reminiscent of the Avalanches' dazzlingly great Since I Left You, another record that finds wide-eyed delight in silly stuff like truth, beauty, and fun, as well as Jens Lekman's Night Falls Over Kortedala and the Tough Alliance's A New Chance. It imagines an impossibly idyllic place through sounds that probably could never have been performed that way in real life. Though it's been said, many times, many ways: Welcome to paradise. Unlike Balearic disco contemporaries such as Studio or A Mountain of One, No Way Down does childlike joy, not hypnotized headiness. Typewriter-like clicks and John Williams-ready horn fanfares, complete with tympani, introduce the opener, ""Maundy Thursday"". This track soon settles into chilled-out synth washes and sober piano melodies, establishing a tone of sincerity without sacrificing lush outdoor beauty. The swooning string flourishes on finale ""Windmill Wedding"" aren't far off from the introduction to hip-hop producer Bangladesh's ubiqitous beat for Lil Wayne's ""A Milli"". Electric guitar and piano ripple across each other like waves, giving way to Spanish-tinged guitar, percussive human breaths, broken-up female vocals, church bells, and bird chirps. The coup de grâce: the whinnying of a horse. You can almost picture someone's gallant lover galloping across the surf. Other tracks are more in the foamy wake of the group's breakout indie late-2006 track ""Beach Party"". ""Collapsing at Your Doorstep"" is gorgeously produced, stupidly catchy, and totally affecting, with an elegant dance groove and an infectious hook. The verses throw lyrics to the wind in favor of wildlife sounds, congas, and woodwinds, which bask in harp glissandos and Göttsching-esque guitar filigrees, plus some string and horn samples. ""No more, no more, no more, no morals anymore/ Throw bottles, throw bottles, throw bottles at your door,"" a woman seems to be singing, followed by children's voices: ""Sorta like a dream?"" ""No -- better."" Nearly as perfect is ""No Excuses"", with handclaps and a yearning chorus: ""No excuses left/ Waiting to fail, but not quite yet."" It's like Saint Etienne for an endless summer. As with many other gifted pop and Balearic artists, Air France also happen to be sticky-fingered. Their sources are varied, yet the pleasure isn't recognizing the different sonic elements, but in relishing their almost supernatural co-existence. ""Beach Party"" lifted its hook from Lisa Stansfield. The No Way Down title track directly quotes the Happy Mondays. The melancholy intro that precedes Go! Team-esque horns and cheers on ""June Evenings"" is from late-1980s TV fantasy-romance ""Beauty and the Beast"", as are the children's voices on ""Collapsing at Your Doorstep"", describing both the show's fantastical underground world and the joy of being with someone you love. If No Way Down is about a place that doesn't exist, it's a place where fairy tales are true and where old pop culture ephemera can-- in Air France's fertile musical imagination, at least-- live happily ever after.","Air France's No Way Down-- currently available either digitally or as a Swedish import-- conjures an idyllic world similar to the one on the Avalanches' dazzlingly great Since I Left You, another record that finds wide-eyed delight in sincerity and beauty.

Pyramids,Pyramids,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba3abf31b7dc7155b2c/1:1/w_160/bb31307d.jpg,2008-06-26 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11929-pyramids/,Hydra Head,"Sheesh, as if the unholy matrimony between indie and drone metal hasn't been tested enough lately, here comes another metal outfit using your favorite bands as a Trojan horse before launching into unapologetic post-rock assault. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining over the existence of bands like Denton, Texas' Pyramids (not to be confused with the 60s surf rock and/or screamo bands of the same name), but rather feeling a bit overwhelmed at the sheer amount of ideas to be unpacked from this monster of a debut album. While it's easy to pinpoint the band's contemporaries, there's no confusing any of the material here for Boris, Sunn 0))), or Jesu. Yes, they play up the same prettiness vs. ugliness tensions as those bands, but the lines aren't drawn so clearly, and most reference points deteriorate within seconds. One Pitchfork staffer compared this debut to ""someone disemboweling a Radiohead record,"" and considering how inchoate this offering is, that's a pretty serviceable point of entry. That said, Pyramids is a much messier affair than simply grafting double-kick bass drums and palm-muted power chords to Kid A. For every skull-rattling series of drones, there's a long expanse of shapeless dream pop, or a thoroughly un-groovable section of cerebral post-rock, or just plain insanity. Despite each of the 10 tracks here hovering around the three-minute mark, Pyramids have hardly organized their creativity into nice, neat packages. The songs tend to meld together rather than stand as self-contained works. Opener ""Sleds"", one of the few exceptions to that rule, eases us into the album with a wispy Sigur Rós melody from singer S. Windett. However, once the haunted house moans of ""Igloo"" take over, there's no getting off the ride. A pesky twin bass drum rears its head at seemingly random points, so arhythmic that even its presence on an ambient no-brainer like ""The Echo of Something Lovely"" feels unnerving. When Windett's vocals detach themselves from the omnipresent flurry of effects swirls and backwards riffs, the album reaches the kind of peaks you'd expect from a Hydra Head release. ""End Resolve"", one of the few instances of melodic and rhythmic synergy, sounds like Thom Yorke fronting Pantera. On ""This House Is Like Any Other World"", Windett unravels what's probably the only sustained vocal melody here, made all the more compelling by its struggle to outshine a thrashing instrumental cacophony. Although the back half stagnates in nondescript death drones, an accompanying disc of remixes provides a glimpse of Pyramids' potential once they better utilize their ideas. Jesu's remix of ""Something Lovely"", one of the bonus disc's four re-imaginings of the track, flashes remnants of the Lifeline EP's delicate shoegaze, a useful lesson in understatement. French metal group Blut Aus Nord take fey opener ""Sleds"" in the opposite direction, slathering the reverb splashes with dirge-like arpeggios and Satanic grunts. As a few botched renderings prove, though, the second disc doesn't fully humble Pyramids, it just trims the fat off areas where they seem hellbent on sabotaging themselves as some sort of post-modernist joke. Sure, they're a very raw talent, but a formidable talent nonetheless, and this record's peaks hint at even greater musical epiphanies to come.",,6.5,
Within These Walls,Damon & Naomi,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba0ea9e61561daa72ab/1:1/w_160/8c6e1d63.jpg,2008-06-25 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11927-within-these-walls/,20/20/20,"Since 1992-- when they were best known as the rhythm section for the much-loved Galaxie 500-- Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang have occupied the kind of niche it's hard to imagine many new indie bands falling into: They make modest, sleepy, intimate folk records, one every few years, around tours and collaborations and running a small label and small press. They've found a pleasant nook and they keep to it, commanding just enough respect and attention to remain comfortably unbothered. Within These Walls-- reviewed here belatedly, and with apologies-- is the latest missive from that nook, and it's a bit difficult to wrap one's head around: It's the best-sounding Damon & Naomi release in a while, but it's also, somehow, less engaging than a lot of the duo's back catalog, a string of records that weren't hugely bothered with ""engagement"" in the first place. The shift in sound is both gorgeous and timely. The current fashion in indie folk music, after all, is for the freak--  something dark, mysterious, and shot through with psychedelics, as if made by hairy, acid-damaged people in forests at night. It's a treat to hear these two shoot off in the opposite direction: Where previous records from them have been cozy to the point of small-room claustrophobia, this one is positively outdoorsy. The horns that murmur through ""On the Aventine"" conjure up open sky, either sun-filled or pleasantly gray; the production sparkles breezily, and makes you want to throw open your windows, take a short stroll. As background music, it's unimpeachably beautiful, warm and understated. There's a realism, space, and depth of field to the sound that's a very welcome respite from the compressed, blaring way most things are produced these days; it suits the band perfectly. The album is at its best when that sound combines with the work of longtime D&N collaborator Michio Kurihara, of the (more interesting) Japanese psych/folk group Ghost: His guitar leads, solos, and embellishments here are flat-out soaring. It's that fact, unfortunately, that underlines what's so problematic about Within These Walls. When Kurihara's playing, the album veers into terrific instrumental music, with that guitar confidently occupying center stage, holding the reins firmly; but when either Damon or Naomi are singing, things falter. Sometimes it's the lyrics, which read better on paper than they do on speakers; sometimes it's the melodies, which lilt pleasantly but never worm their way very far into one's head. But mostly, I suspect, it's the limitations of those two voices, both of which are smooth, clear, sedate, and close-miced-- tones that work well for fragile bedroom folk, but struggle to command the stage of these wide-open songs, especially when put up against the power of Kurihara's guitar. This is strange, since so many Damon & Naomi albums have come off the other way: decent albums some of us are more inclined to like because they feature the right personalities, two people in a nook we like to check in on. Within These Walls feels like the opposite: a very good record weighed down by two personalities who can't quite command it-- like seeing television stars look suddenly awkward and meek on a movie screen. Which is a shame, because when you're not paying enough attention to this record to need a commanding center, it sounds absolutely marvelous.","Another album of modest, sleepy, intimate folk from the rhythm section for the much-loved band Galaxie 500, this is the best-sounding Damon & Naomi release in a while.

Wolves and Wishes,Dosh,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b63c5e6ef959693228e0/1:1/w_160/4bcc2d4d.jpg,2008-06-25 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11531-wolves-and-wishes/,Unknown,"Dosh fits many of the backpack rapper stereotypes. He sits on the Anticon roster, a bastion of rule-breaking hip-hop that has no truck with the likes of, say, Cam'ron or Petey Pablo. He comes from Minneapolis, home of the Replacements and Prince, but wanting for nationally known rappers, save the canonized-on-the-quad Atmosphere. Dosh's beats aren't composed of soul samples, drowning in bass, or expressly built to house verses and choruses: they are impressionistic, surging, cut loose of 4/4 constraints. Over the frenzy of drum machines and looped samples, he would take the pensive swirl of his vintage Rhodes and pile it dramatically-- with a flair for surprise-- on top of something else. But he doesn't rap. His connection to the genre won't be obvious to most listeners. In fact, you might call him electronica's answer to the rising tide, reported in The New York Times Magazine, of one-man operations that sound like bands. But listening to Dosh, as opposed to listening to the equally skilled Four Tet, you don't have the sense of technology rudely intruding into the creative process, of the wizard too busy to care whether we can see him behind the curtain. He does care: where Four Tet parades his mastery of vivid, unapologetic collage, Dosh goes for a mastery of illusion. So like any illusionist, he takes care to start and end with a bang. Only Dosh could imagine, let alone orchestrate, a meeting of Andrew Bird's tender violin and Fog's hyperactive guitar and bass. The play of vibes and keys lends this, the album opener ""Don't Wait for the Needle to Drop"", a mesmerizing texture, the grooves recalling a funk-tinged, gamelan symphony. ""Capture the Flag"" falls on the other end of Wolves and Wishes, where it reaches for the same exotic grandeur. Strings appear again, in sampled form, along with the Dosh's fuzzy arpeggios. But now we hear a sax pumping away. And more surprisingly, we hear Dosh's own voice lowered over the maze of noise, cutting a passage of coolness and clarity into the thickets of dense, off-kilter instrumentation. Between these bursts of color, the album rarely tones it down. Without sounding repetitive, a network of reappearing themes, people, and sounds holds Wolves and Wishes together. Andrew Bird returns to grace ""Kit and Pearle"", for instance, with more anguished turns on his violin, underneath Dark Dark Dark's sighing vocals. The outer tracks' air of exoticism pours back in on the rhythmically brilliant ""Food Cycles"" and ""Keep Up Appearances"". And Dosh's protégé Mike Lewis launches his sax into Jeremy Ylvisaker's vibrating, room-filling sheets of reverb on ""Wolves"". Not until we reach the final minutes of the tectonic, Sun Ra-repping, Arthur Russell-influenced epic ""First Impossible"" do we hear an unexpected, unmistakable rap beat. It fits right in. People want to call this IDM. The label tells vendor to file this under ""Rock"". Bristling with jazzy forms, infused with a global soul, Wolves and Wishes turns hip-hop's philosophy of bricolage into a glitchy, raucous, genre-spanning achievement.","On his latest, the Minneapolis producer moves fluidly between genres, incorporating the spirit of hip-hop even as his music veers closer to the electronic collage approach of, say, Four Tet. Guests include Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, Andrew Bird, and Fog.

Dual Hawks,South San Gabriel,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9fabf31b7dc7155b24/1:1/w_160/6186140c.jpg,2008-06-25 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11926-dual-hawks/,Misra,"Centro-Matic and South San Gabriel are typically discussed as more or less solo projects for Will Johnson, the ambitious Austin troubadour who specializes in dark, dusty desert noir. It's not just that he is a primary contributor to both bands, or that he launched Centro-Matic as a home-recording project, but that his contributions under each banner sound so distinctive. There's no mistaking his gravelly vocals, his rummage sale lyrics, or his rusted-out guitar tone. Each of his groups defines itself by how it deploys these signature elements: Centro-Matic grind out weathered but tightly wound indie rock, treating Johnson's sometimes indecipherable lyrics as fever dreams brought on by exposure to the sun and distortion. South San Gabriel, which features all of Centro-Matic plus a revolving line-up of friends, dresses Johnson's vocal in strings, drum loops, and off-kilter sounds, their ornate arrangements favoring ambience above all else. Dual Hawks is, for lack of a better word, a double album: two LPs packaged together, one from Centro-Matic and the other from South San Gabriel, explicitly underscoring the innate similarities between the two projects as well as the complementary differences. On paper, it sounds like an intriguing idea, but the Centro-Matic half so thoroughly outshines the other that it's hard to imagine anyone playing both after a month or two. In other words, it's bound to become a single album in practice. Which raises a question: Why even compartmentalize these variant musical impulses? Why not shuffle them song by song, so that Centro-Matic's spiritedness might add gravity to South San Gabriel's ambience and vice versa? It's not that the South San Gabriel half is bad, just a bit slow and sleepy. Where Centro-Matic songs seem spring-loaded, these tracks sprawl. Songs like the plodding ""When the Angels Will Put out Their Lights"" and the thudding ""Of Evil/For Evil"" sound overthought and fussy, as if Johnson worked to include everyone who showed up at the studio. There are moments of clarity, as on the clockwork ""Kept on the Sly"" (Matt Pence's drums are as distinctive as Johnson's vocals) or on closer ""From This I Will Awake"", with its combination of organ drones and wailing voices. There are eleven musicians on these recordings, yet it still sounds like a Johnson solo project (specifically like his actual solo album Vultures Await), placing his vocals at the forefront and dressing them in strings and effects that suggest, but don't always achieve, a sort of No Country widescreen vista. Tighter, louder, faster, and punchier, the Centro-Matic half picks up where 2006's excellent Fort Recovery left off, maintaining that musical intensity across eleven songs. The drums still scuffle, the guitars still grind, and Johnson still comes across as a desert romantic on par with Calexico or Howe Gelb. Unlike them, however, he has a weakness for lyrical impenetrability. ""Eighteen tubes of butane running corporation fairs / It's discount-like and out of time,"" goes the opener, ""The Rat Patrol and DJs"", but as Johnson sings them, they sound nevertheless compelling, especially when he crafts unexpected hooks from the ooo-ooo-ooo's at the end of each chorus couplet. As the album proceeds, Johnson allows quick glimpses of larger issues, like the doomed rock shows on ""Remind Us Alive"": ""Did you notice the frequencies will damage you for life?"" Johnson spits, drawing out the long syllable in the last word, ""as if the saccharine songs they're playing ain't enough of a lie."" The band itself undergirds Johnson's words with a sound that is anything but saccharine. Pence alternates between chugging, nearly robotic beats and cymbal-punishing high drama, and Scott Danbom's synths pop up in odd places, like he's stalking you. Centro-Matic are a guitar band above all else, and Johnson and Mark Hedman's dual hawk guitars slice against each other, the rhythm lines almost undercutting the leads. As crafty a songwriter as Johnson may be, the music delivers more meaning than the words. That's what South San Gabriel shoot for and what Centro-Matic achieve naturally.","Will Johnson's two underrated projects-- one delivering tightly wound indie rock (Centro-Matic), the other focusing on ornate arrangements and ambience (South San Gabriel)-- share the spotlight on this 2xCD split Misra release.

Ice Cream Spiritual,Ponytail,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba2c0084474cd0c28d6/1:1/w_160/e583beec.jpg,2008-06-25 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11928-ice-cream-spiritual/,We Are Free,"You know that gesture when you put your lips together but let them go slack, and then blow air our of your mouth while humming? It's not a raspberry-- no tongue involved-- more like an imitation horse whinny, and it's the kind of thing you might see a baby doing when she's figuring out all the different sounds that the body can produce. Well, Molly Siegel of Ponytail knows this gesture, and she thinks enough of it to have it be her first sound on the band's second album, Ice Cream Spiritual. At the beginning of the opening ""Beg Waves"", as two guitars play one little angular riff over and over while the drummer makes a nifty hi-hat pattern, like all three are stretching before heading out for a long run, Siegel puts her lips together and lets them flap and then turns the hum into a sort of ""mmmh-bhrrrrrrrr-ahhh!"" And we're off. Siegel's voice is an object of fascination in Ponytail because you can't figure out exactly what she's doing and why. The guitars (there are two, played by Ken Seeno and Dustin Wong, but no bass) and drums (by Jeremy Hyman) speak the familiar language or rock'n'roll, but she's coming from somewhere else. She grunts. She shrieks. She wails. She moans. She howls. She chants. She almost never sings, forget about talking: With her approach to vocals, a bunch of words strung together would only be a distraction. Of the however many hundreds of sounds she makes over the course of this album, maybe 1% are used in service of an understandable unit of language. The rest of the time she goes where the spirit moves her. It'd be one thing if she were ""using her voice as an instrument,"" as we music writers like to say, but that's not really it either. She doesn't have any particular vocal gifts, no four-octave range or studied arsenal of effects, and she's not doing anything you couldn't do if you had the desire, stamina, and a few bags of medicated cough drops. But here she is. It's hard to know how Siegel's approach might work if she were in another kind of band, but in Ponytail her voice fits perfectly. While their sound may at times overlap with certain experimental rock outfits from Japan-- OOIOO, say, or Afrirampo-- Ponytail are more inclined toward catchy riffs and hooks, and thus far they've shown an aversion to the abstract, free-form noise odyssey. It's not enough fun. Deerhoof are another common reference point, which makes some sense, but Ponytail are far less studied, the more cerebral prog overtones swapped out for the ""Hey guys, let's grab these guitars and make a racket in the garage!"" pleasures of a surf rock band. Which is not to say that Ponytail are casual and making it up as they go along. All three instrumentalists, as far as I can tell, have chops, and these songs are filled with the kind herky-jerky stop/starts, tempo changes, harmonized leads, and tricky fills you don't think to try unless you have some confidence in your ability. One of the things that elevates this record above Kamehameha, the band's comparatively crude (but still pretty great) 2006 debut, is the sound. With J Robbins producing and the vastly improved sonics, you have a much clearer idea of what everyone is doing. Little things are important with this band, and here, you can actually make them out. So you get all the tactile detail of the crashing drums in ""G Shock"" as they move from the rolls of the elongated opening section to the galloping propulsion of the tune's middle. You get the hissing of the subtle hi-hat during the track's quiet breakdown, where Siegel coos almost melodically and everything all of a sudden turns sweet. And you get the real sense of atmosphere from the opening of ""Late For School"" as one guitar lets loose a gorgeous cloud of feedback drone, which is then dispersed by the insane arpeggios that take over two minutes in. (Indeed, the guitar tones throughout are an absolute wonder, enough to make even the most jaded electronic music head fall in love again with the possibilities of the guitar/amp interface.) While Japanese noise-rock or latter-day indie prog come to mind, the band I keep thinking about while listening to Ice Cream Spiritual-- and this even without proper tunes-- is the Pixies. Something about the twists and turns these songs take-- the way they don't quite work like they're supposed to and so wind up working better-- has the feel of Surfer Rosa/Doolittle at their most chaotic. At times it seems like Ponytail took the second half of ""Tame"", the point where Frank Black is reduced to heavy breathing and throat-shredding screams while Kim Deal lets out her ""Ah-ah-ah"" sighs, and extended that minute-long section to album length. And you could see these guys writing something about a superhero named Tony. Another way to understand Ponytail, finally, is by thinking of them in terms of Baltimore, their city. Like Dan Deacon and the Wham City crew, Ponytail are finding ways to take the concerns of childhood and channel them into deceptively sophisticated music. But instead of the 8-bit toys that every middle class American has laying in front of their televisions, Ponytail build monuments to the boundless energy of kids with a real rock band's tools. And it's here that the pre-verbal approach taken by Siegel again becomes important. I should note that her vocals are going to bug plenty of people, and she may well turn out to be the reason you can't get into this band. But heard another way, over the course of this tremendously fun album, from that opening blurt on, she begins to make a weird kind of sense. Listening to her, I think of John Cage's quote about poetry taken to its logical extreme: She has nothing to say and she is saying it. Loudly. And with a sense of joy that's nothing short of infectious.","Too often considered a great live band-- which it is-- but not thrilling on record, the Baltimore group's studio output continues to improve as well, helped here by J Robbins' production and vastly improved sonics.

Remix Romance Vol. 2,Sally Shapiro,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9eeb335119a49eca9d/1:1/w_160/2770f3cf.jpg,2008-06-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11925-remix-romance-vol-2/,Paper Bag,"Strike while the fire is hot. David Cook from American Idol had 11 singles in the Hot 100 shortly after his big win. Lil Wayne put up seven Hot 100 singles the week of Tha Carter III. On a much more intimate scale, Sally Shapiro-- the pseudonymous Swedish chanteuse whose Disco Romance debut LP has been bewitching audiences with its fragile mix of warm-hearted synth-pop and icy Italo disco since its original European release in 2006-- has now released her second remix album of 2008. Artistically if not commercially, it's a better idea than Wayne's godawful guest verse on the latest Mariah Carey remix. Great though Disco Romance is, I'm not sure how many people were clamoring for two volumes of remixes from it. Of the people who might be inclined to check out Remix Romance Vol. 2, though, I can't imagine too many will feel their 10 bucks (or, sigh, torrent ratio) were completely wasted. Remix Romance Vol. 1 came as the famously reticent Shapiro was stepping out with her first interviews and DJ gigs, and its 10 tracks turned her shy bedroom disco into disco-disco, putting her wispy vocals and sugar-frosted melodies through the club-friendlier paces of top-notch remixers such as Lindstrøm, Junior Boys, and Juan MacLean. It was a surprisingly successful reconfiguration of the sound Shapiro and producer Johan Agebjörn conceived for Disco Romance, and Remix Romance Vol. 2 is, despite a slight overall drop in quality, refreshingly of a piece with its predecessor. With so many versions of the same Shapiro material already floating around on the world's luckier hard drives, Remix Romance Vol. 2's best tracks tend to rework their originals rather dramatically. Much as Norway's Lindstrøm did ""Time to Let Go"" as epic psychedelic disco, Canada's the Russian Futurists make Shapiro's signature internet hit, ""I'll Be By Your Side"", into a Russian Futurists song. Considering the Russian Futurists are, like Shapiro, synth-pop romantics who tend to send critics scrambling for snowflake-flimsy metaphors, their ""Side"" keeps plenty of Shapiro's spirit even while adding bouncy lo-fi beats, thrumming guitar-like synths, and lead vocals by the group's Matthew Adam Hart. The Postal Service half Dntel puts sparse, glitchy beats reminiscent of his other group's ""Against All Odds"" cover behind ""Find My Soul"", with wobbly vocal effects that perhaps explain why the song has been retitled ""Find My Ghost"". An Italo disco original, Alexander Robotnick, shifts the Roger Gunnarsson-written ""Anorak Christmas"" from synth-driven twee carol to beat-heavier Eurovision contestant. Newer artists also find plenty to say through Shapiro's songs. Montreal's CFCF-- whose remixing credits include Crystal Castles, HEALTH, the Teenagers, and Apache Beat-- kicks off the compilation with a version of ""Time to Let Go"" that sounds like Justice if their steez were 1980s adult-contemporary rather than heavy metal, as cheesed-out keyboards float across muscular bass lines and thumping beats. Closer to a proper Ed Banger banger is a remix of the same song by Spitzer, a buzzy French brother duo who also recently remixed Kylie Minogue; they chop up Shapiro's vocals and use them as wordless accompaniment for their aggressive filter-disco. Two contributions by fellow Frenchman Dyylan may be excessive, but his takes on ""Hold Me So Tight"" and U.S. Disco Romance bonus track ""Jackie Jackie"" could hardly be more different-- the first lush and upbeat, the second spaced-out and beatless, a pleasant-enough comedown to finish the album. Remix Romance Vol. 2 isn't going to be anybody's favorite album of 2008, but it doesn't have to be. Aside from unnecessarily reprising Agebjörn's ""Norwegian electrojazz"" remix of ""Find My Soul"", which much of Shapiro's Web-savvy fanbase will probably have already heard from the original Swedish Disco Romance, the second compilation of Shapiro remixes continues to put enough new touches on Shapiro's slight if solid songbook to offer the diehards (for whom this release is presumably intended) a few fresh twinges of romance. New listeners should still head straight for the proper LP, but in a time when remixes have come to function more like blog-oriented marketing tools than something fans or DJs might actually spend money on, Remix Romance Vol 2. sounds less like a case of striking while the fire is hot than a breath of fresh air. And with global warming working its magic on my air-conditioning bills lately, even the slightest breeze is welcome.","Great though Sally Shapiro's Disco Romance is, we're not sure how many people were clamoring for two volumes of remixes from it. Still, here's the second one of the year, and it encouragingly features works from top-notch producers such as Dntel, the Russian Futurists, and Alexander Robotnick.

The Blue God,Martina Topley-Bird,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9b5e6ef95969322c54/1:1/w_160/402ca4da.jpg,2008-06-24 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11922-the-blue-god/,Martina Topley Bird,"Martina Topley Bird, one-time featured vocalist for Tricky, last released an album in 2003, the understated Mercury Prize nominee Quixotic, which seemed to want to pick up where Massive Attack left off. It was mostly melody-free and plodding, but also adventurous, sexy, and different. Five years later, and with production assistance from Danger Mouse, Topley Bird tries her hand at groovy songs built on tinny keyboards, dirty guitars, and organ. Songs that bring to mind the 1960s referencing of Amy Winehouse and Duffy might please some listeners. Like ""Baby Blue"", for example, which contributes a glittering piano to Topley Bird's feathery vocals. In general, though, her voice isn't strong enough to carry Wino's genre, let alone the song. Like so many of her efforts, this song is too quiet-- the voice muffled by heavy drums, synth beats, and a swathe of effects pedals. Similarly, ""Poison"" and ""Valentine"" also bend to an apparent craving for all-female trios of a bygone era without much success. ""Shangri La"", along with opener ""Phoenix"", may be the standout here. The mix of violins, organ, and bass is too chaotic, but it's intriguing once the vocals arrive just over a minute in. The chorus-verse format organizes everything into a clean, moving, enjoyable force. The sound of the words, if not their meaning, creates the momentum here: ""When I reach town/ Baby I'm a touchdown/ I see us in the way we are/ And I'm running for a train/ And I'm coming home again/ And then maybe I can slowdown."" There is a lot of vertiginous rabbit-hole exploration on The Blue God, and while it might be unfair to suggest this kind of music doesn't fit into the big picture of 2008, well, it really doesn't. There is proof in nearly every genre that listeners just want to dance; the requirement leaves room for every kind of emotion, as long as it's slotted into a tempo of 120 or above. Topley Bird attempts to get things moving multiple times on the album, but the overall effect is one of balladic daydreaming. At those times, her creations are overly delicate, her message lost in compositions that are alternately frothy and sludgy. The Orbison-like ""Valentine"" is pretty, aerated with harmonies and slow guitar strums. But it's still too sleepy-- not just in tempo, but in its ability to create complexities and tiny revolutions from a repeating melody and a diverse set of instruments.","The Mercury Prize nominee and one-time vocalist for Tricky returns after five years with help from Danger Mouse.

Take Refuge in Clean Living,Grails,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb775e6ef95969322c01/1:1/w_160/90fd4686.jpg,2008-06-24 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11605-take-refuge-in-clean-living/,Important,"The members of the Portland, Oregon-based Grails may wish that reviews of their albums didn't always open with references to bong water and lava lamps. They are clearly serious musicians, after all, and though their music swims in 1970s head-rock signifiers-- reverbed guitar washes, droning sitars, and drum-circle bongos? Don't mind if I do!-- it builds momentum with an unforced grace and attention to detail that warrants more careful consideration than corny jokes about incense and beanbag chairs allow. But when you decide to name the opening track on your fourth album of warmly pulsing instrumental rock ""Stoned at the Taj Again""-- well, you're just asking for it. Actually, the stoner-rock tag probably wouldn't bother these guys much. They identify themselves on their MySpace page as-- gasp!-- a jam band, and thoughtfully name-check Pink Floyd right up front, so that we don't have to. The five long-form compositions that comprise Take Refuge In Clean Living all occupy more or less the same languorous headspace and blend together into a pleasantly hypnotic whole. But repeat listens reveal a sturdy musical intelligence upholding the entire affair, which is probably why an album this drowsy never once feels aimless. ""Stoned at the Taj"" builds slowly from a mammoth-sounding two-note synthesizer riff into some delicate pentatonic guitar noodling before the central motif, a hazy four-note sitar refrain, announces itself, and the track launches into a raga-rock rave-up that recalls the Byrds. (Throughout the album, it should be said, Grails demonstrate the effortless command of faux-Easternisms that only lifelong study of ""Eight Miles High"" and ""Kashmir"" provides.) Elsewhere, Take Refuge offers a haunted cover of the Ventures' ""11th Hour"" that transforms cool surf-rock into windswept desert-rock via a cavern of reverb and an imperial harpsichord; the result could pass off as incidental music for David Lynch's Inland Empire. That air of dark mystery, which pervades the album, is partly due to the skillful arrangements, but also comes from the immaculate mastering and production, which makes heavy use of contrast and lends the appropriate air of otherworldliness. The best moments on Take Refuge in Clean Living resemble ""a pinch felt in a dream,"" to quote another (far superior) album that takes place in a similar numinous middle distance: Perfect From Now On. Grails have been honing their spaghetti-western drone-rock for almost a decade, and have reached a point where they can skillfully fold just about any element into their ambient haze. To say that nothing stands out from the whole on Take Refuge is not so much an insult as it is an observation that Grails have succeeded in their aims, which is to create a full-length that flows uninterrupted from start to finish. There is something charmingly anachronistic about this goal, and it adds to the appealing sense that Grails exist in a kind of time warp. After all, it was never really considered ""cool"" to make this sort of music, but that hasn't stopped three or four generations of bands from turning down the lights and attempting to craft something resembling a soundscape. And there are moments here-- especially on the quietly gorgeous cello-and-piano coda ""Clean Living""-- where Grails successfully transcend the trappings of their genre and tap into something truly celestial.","Having honed their spaghetti-western drone-rock for almost a decade, Portland's Grails have reached a point where they can skillfully fold just about any element into their ambient haze.

Occasion,The Goslings,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb7cea9e61561daa7255/1:1/w_160/acff6215.jpeg,2008-06-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11609-occasion/,Not Not Fun,"To call the Goslings' gritty music ""post-apocalyptic"" might be a tad over-dramatic. But there is something destructive and earth-scorching about their hyper-distorted noise/metal. Maybe ""post-disaster"" is more like it: Occasion might not sound like the end of the world, but it definitely sounds like the end of a record collection. Imagine a room destroyed by fire, with only melted LPs of black metal, harsh noise, and heavy shoegaze left behind. Pile the remains onto a turntable, dig a needle into the smoldering muck, and it might sound something like the warped sludge of this Florida duo. On the surface, the Goslings seem dependent on glitches, ripples, and other anomalies produced when extreme volume overloads amplifiers and recoding equipment. Almost nothing on Occasion is clear; everything is caked in a sonic crust so dense, it's hard to imagine how the original notes and beats would sound on their own. But there's more to what Max and Leslie Soren are doing than technical fuckery. Like other prime abusers of audio reproduction-- Coachwhips, Ariel Pink, Sightings-- they use distortion as a tool rather than a gimmick. Their lumbering songs are inherently distorted, written with warped senses of time and tone that require a muddy environment to thrash around in. That time warp is the most appealing aspect of Occasion. Most songs seem to randomly speed up, slow down, and hit sonic black holes out of time altogether. ""Motorcade"" sounds like a My Bloody Valentine tune at 16rpm, with big chords stretched into rubbery elastic. The crunchy ""Vitium"" sticks Leslie's howls inside grinding static, while the album's best track, ""Mandy"", is a masterpiece of temporal illusion. At first drums set a regular pulse, but soon the pace deadens, then quickens, then caves in on itself, turning guitar sludge, drum pound, and buried vocals into a tornado of debris. Occasion might sound like an experimental record, and certainly the Goslings push sonic envelopes. But at heart they are a metal band, and their unit of currency is the dark, heavy riff. They never lose sight of the primal power of elongated chords-- each song can be seen as an attempt to test how durable one big riff and one clanging drum beat can be. The answer is almost always ""very,"" and the mileage the Goslings get out of their sputtering twin engines continues to impress.","Latest from this Florida-based metal/noise duo might not sound like the end of the world, but it definitely sounds like the end of a record collection.

Yearbook 2,Studio,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9cabf31b7dc7155b1e/1:1/w_160/5f7ddb32.jpg,2008-06-24 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11923-yearbook-2/,Information,"I'd played Studio's remix of Kylie Minogue's ""2 Hearts"" to a friend, promising with an evangelist's zeal that her mind would be blown. ""It sounds like the Gipsy Kings,"" she replied in a neutral tone. It wasn't a complaint, but nor was it a compliment; perhaps she was simply commenting on the remarkable fact that someone would want to make a Kylie song sound like the Gipsy Kings, or the even more remarkable fact that Kylie herself would propagate the result. A few months later, over at her house with some friends, the familiar sound of Kylie's vocals and Studio's ringing guitars emerged in the background. The moment passed without comment, but I felt a small, irrational surge of satisfaction: somehow even ""it sounds like the Gipsy Kings"" had become a selling point. Before people start rushing towards or away from this release on the assumption that they'll find a ""Bamboleo"" or two, I suspect ""the Gipsy Kings"" was shorthand for ""lashings of Spanish guitar."" But the style of the observation, rather than the content, is what matters: There's something about Studio that compels people to repeat this gesture, emphasizing the purposeless perversity of whatever sonic lineage they identify-- just replace ""the Gipsy Kings"" with ""Sting"" or ""World Party,"" or whatever you like. It's not a surprising response: The most widespread and painfully boring critical line on ""nu-Balearic"" music is that its primary function is to render previously intolerable music tolerable-to-hipsters, redeeming Elton John or Paul Simon via the canny addition of a disco beat and some dub echo. This take isn't wrong, exactly, but it's the kind of sociological analysis that makes you hate the world a little bit more after reading it, rather like earnest discussions of how to woo soccer moms for votes. That, plus pretty much anyone who tries to take a position of knowing ""I see through this"" superiority towards hipsters is at first glance being hypocritical. The kernel of truth here is this: What Balearic revivalism does is create a single ""genre"" that can portray a whole host of different types of music in their best light, giving a sense of second-order purpose to music whose functional purpose wasn't entirely clear previously. Perhaps it was too slow, too elaborate, either too songful or not songful enough, too cheesy or perhaps too self-important. Studio rate highly on all of these fronts: Too enraptured with grooves to be a proper rock band, but too attached to morose rock grandstanding not to be; too torpid and dreamy to be a proper dance outfit, but too in love with dancing to be anything else. More subtly, the Swedish duo's music verges on cheesy at the precise moments that it appears self-important (although it's a truism that these are frequently two sides of the same coin). Studio's self-importance is discomforting because it's never clear whether their reach exceeds the grasp or, rather, the act of reaching just a little too far is the entire point of their music. Half the thrills come from watching just how effectively they can deploy bombast. Following on from Yearbook 1, a collection of their own songs, this second installment offers an abrupt left-hand turn by focusing on Studio's facility as remixers for others, and it's surprising to discover just how easily the Studio sound can be grafted onto the work of others with surprising versatility. Without their own despairing vocals, Studio sound less like the Cure listening to Fela Kuti on a beach in Ibiza, and rather closer to the emergent nu-Balearic norm of heavy, languorous disco grooves-- the 4x4 kick drum is surprisingly dominant, although not unwelcome. What distinguishes Studio's work from their peers, beyond their ever-present fetish for cascading sprays of iridescent guitar, is their prickly restlessness: Most of the inclusions here resist the temptation to coast on a strong groove, instead continually morphing through a kaleidoscopic succession of interlaced motifs like a Mandelbrot set. Yearbook 2 alternates between one-offs (like the gentle summertime pop of their remake of the Shout Out Louds' ""Impossible""-- the most conservative cut here) and a sort of staple Studio remix sound: mysterious, almost dark disco grooves populated by glistening synthesizers and glittering shards of the duo's trademark guitar. The quietly ominous epic treatment of A Mountain of One's ""Brown Piano"" and the broiling, dramatic take on Williams' ""Love on a Real Train""-- they could almost be movements in a single piece-- win the day for the latter group, if only because their glowing eddies and curlicues of sound offer the most ostentatious display of the duo's strengths. As remixers, Studio are at their best when most tantric, when their grooves submit to the effervescent fluidity summed up in the title (and, vaguely, the sound) of Can's album Flow Motion, sliding inexorably forward from detail to detail on an endless plateau of simmering intensity. Such is Studio's studio wizardry that it's easy to forget that they're also a rock band, especially when they're crafting such delicate, delectable avant-disco remixes. But it's the absence of Studio-as-themselves which ultimately makes Yearbook 2 a less captivating experience than its predecessor. On a track-by-track basis, this is as much a bonus as a drawback: Freed from the distractions of having to concoct songs, the duo can concentrate on eking out every drop of prettiness from their grooves, and there's a satisfying sense of aesthetic purity to the formal loveliness of much of their work here. But taken as an album, Yearbook 2 can seem emotionally flattened out when compared to its predecessor; there's nothing as gloriously wallowing as ""West Side"" or as unabashedly emotional as ""Out There"". The one tune to transcend this dilemma entirely is the remix of ""2 Hearts"", perhaps because Studio have simply replaced one exaggerated song blueprint (moping pseudo-goth British indie rock) with another (ecstatic femme-pop). In fact, Studio's version ends up a better song than the source material, its relative spareness allowing Kylie's performance to shine with an intensity that is undetectable in the original's over-cluttered glam homage. Submerged in Studio's glittering guitar spiderwebs, supremely supine disco beats and endless layers of dub echo, Kylie's vocals are genuinely moving. All the glam ambiguity of the original is sensitively excised from this version: The song's deadpan sarcasm had no place amongst Studio's endless horizons of lovestruck earnestness. More than any other tracks here, ""2 Hearts"" successfully makes the argument for Studio as an in-house band for other pop outfits: a deadly-serious Scandinavian Sly & Robbie, if you will. Hopefully the duo won't be forced to make the choice between backroom boys and rock gods any time soon: More than just about anyone else they deserve to have their cake and eat it too.","What Balearic revivalism does is create a single ""genre"" that can portray a whole host of different types of music in their best light, and here, Studio-- one of the best purveyors of nu-Balearic-- does the trick to tracks by Kylie Minogue, Love Is All, A Mountain of One, and Shout Out Louds, among others.

Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust,Sigur Rós,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9d5e6ef95969322c5a/1:1/w_160/c0e7829a.jpg,2008-06-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11924-me-su-i-eyrum-vi-spilum-endalaust/,XL,"In the near-decade since their 1999 breakthrough Ágætis Byrjun, Iceland's Sigur Rós have made pathos their playground. For them, ""little"" is scarcely an option: Instead, they've built a career out of conjuring God-sized renderings of sorrow, fragility, and teary joy, rarely on a scale anything less than epic. They've done this instinctively and automatically, sometimes to the detriment of their compositions, leaving the impression that the songs are secondary vessels for spectacle. In the sense that they're less concerned with intellectual honesty than they are with the overall visceral impact of the thing they're creating, Sigur Rós are the Michael Bays of melodrama. That, of course, is no bad thing-- especially not for a band that does spectacle so well-- but it does invite a problematic dynamic when it comes to the long haul, one wherein they run the very real risk of piling on ever-more ludicrously for the sake of justifying their existence. That's why, after four full-lengths and a string of EPs that saw them bloat their sensory cavalcade of strings, horns, cavernously reverberated guitars, and sweetly vocals to heaven-scraping levels of pomp, last month's single ""Gobbledigook"" came as a refreshing and shockingly grounded new direction. Gone were the celestial delays and cloud-parting refrains; in their place, a tangle of acoustic guitars, thumping percussion, and rabid vocals. Not only did it sound like Sigur Rós doing Animal Collective (!), it sounded like a way out. And certainly, about half of Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust (translation: ""With a buzz in our ears we play endlessly"") constitutes a much-needed change of direction for Sigur Rós. Building on the gains made from 2005's transitional Takk, they deliver plenty of moments where they sound more spirited, looser, almost playful. The unifying element in these instances is brevity; from the tumbling, modest solo acoustic ballad ""Illgresi"" to the celebratory ""Við spilum endalaust"", some of the band's best songs come when they consciously confine themselves to the pop format. You get the feeling that, on a past album, they might have let ""Góðan daginn""'s acoustic guitar arpeggios and chiming bell tones waft around interminably. Similarly, one of the album's highlights is a major key summer song called ""Inní mér syngur vitleysingur"" which manages to squeeze some of the band's hallmarks (parading horns, glockenspiels, and a stunning teardown and subsequent buildup) into a positively economical four minutes. The compression generally serves them well, forcing them to make choices they might not otherwise confront when there's 10 minutes of real estate to occupy. Með suð was produced by Flood (U2, PJ Harvey, Nine Inch Nails) and recorded, variously, in New York, London, Reykjavik, and Havana, a sure sign of a conscious attempt to shake up their methodology. If there's anything disappointing, it's that Sigur Rós weren't more militant about affecting that change. While the album's greatest triumph is its relative leanness, two songs still threaten the nine-minute mark. The first is the conflicting ""Festival"", which features singer Jonsi Birgisson doing his quavering choirboy routine over a churchly organ for an interminable four and a half minutes before swelling into an instrumental eruption on par with Sigur Rós' finest ever. It's so arresting and muscular on its own that it hardly needs the first bit to introduce it; that the band chose needlessly to build it into a beast feels a bit like old habits dying hard. Far more unforgivable is the comically overstuffed ""Ára bátur"", which is a bet-hedging and nerveless exercise that bridges another aimless solo piano movement with a culminating swell so over-the-top that Andrew Lloyd Webber himself would have deemed it a little much. That the album's official bio proudly touts the 90-strong recording (which boasts both the London Sinfonietta and the London Oratory Boys' Choir) as ""the largest musical undertaking of the band's career""-- and that it's easily the worst thing on here-- speaks volumes of a different kind. These safe, pandering choices otherwise mar what could have been a game-changing evolution. Instead, Með suð promisingly announces itself as a sunny, happy, easily digestible record before relapsing into old school, heavy-bloat, high-calorie Sigur Rós. Ultimately, there are too many wonderful moments here to deem it anything less than a beautiful record, but armchair producers might find themselves similarly wishing for less fat. How do you say ""less is more"" in Hopelandic? I worry we'll never know.","After four full-lengths and a string of EPs of heaven-scraping pomp, Iceland's Sigur Rós give about half of their new LP over to a much-needed change of direction, offering plenty of moments where they sound more spirited, looser, almost playful.

The In Crowd,Kidz in the Hall,by: Ben Westhoff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6275e6ef959693228c8/1:1/w_160/a9058764.jpg,2008-06-23 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11514-the-in-crowd/,KochDuckdown,"""I'm so cool, man,"" Naledge says on ""Mr. Alladatshit"". It's true, and it bodes poorly for hacks like me, because at this point Kidz in the Hall-- an Ivy League-educated underground rap group signed to Buckshot's label-- have generated such a strong buzz that they're pretty much set. They did it through a slew of celebrity collaborations and a hilarious video, ""Drivin' Down the Block (Low End Theory)"", which has gotten much-deserved TRL airplay. The album-closing remix of the song featuring Pusha T, Bun B, and the Cool Kids is quite good as well, and the version floating around produced by and featuring El-P is even better. Fine. But this is not a great backpack hip-hop album. Everyone complains about Naledge's shortcomings as an MC, but more unfortunate is his lyrical aversion to clever turns of phrase. There's nothing here as half as imaginative or witty as ""Cappuccino"", the breakout track from L.A. rappers the Knux, a duo often compared to the Kidz. As Peter Macia noted in his spot-on Pitchfork review of the guys' last record, School Was My Hustle: ""There's little evidence that school was actually their hustle."" And indeed the album's lyrical anemia is all the more surprising considering their Penn degrees. The cringe-worthy lines could fill a whole song: ""Ride tracks sort of like a NASCAR"" (from ""Paper Trail""); ""My car like a Shop Rite, got cheese, got bread, yeah yeah I shop right"" (from ""Drivin' Down the Block""); ""I think I love her, but I think I hate her at the very same time"" (from ""Love Hangover""). The beats are less urgent this time around as well. There's nothing that equals the power of Hustle tracks ""Ms. Juanita"", ""Wassup Jo'"", or ""Ritalin"". Double-O's tracks are breezy, nostalgic, and serviceable throughout, but don't stick in your head. ""In the spirit of Jimi, Rick James, and James Brown,"" Naledge announces at the beginning of ""Lucifer's Joyride"", but a more accurate characterization would be ""in the spirit of Gym Class Heroes,"" the current MTV Hits darlings who also play lip service to the greats but water their shit down with clumsy innuendo such as when Naledge encouraging us to ""get a little drunk, get a little naked. Let's go where the wind takes us."" (Are we in a boat?) ""Lucifer's Joyride"" has little Jimi, Rick, or James, but it does have just about everything else-- vocoder; allusions to drugs, gambling, and prostitution; a soul sample so drowned out you can barely hear it, and of course Gym Class Heroes' Travis McCoy, who is better at doing what he does than these guys are. With their frantic, rushed rhymes, and beats which are a bit too eager to please, the Kidz may be popular. But if they want to any cred they're going to have to learn to be themselves.","Kidz in the Hall's sophomore album is poised to be their breakthrough, but it's merely breezy, nostalgic, and serviceable.

A Perfect Place OST,Mike Patton,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb61ea9e61561daa7212/1:1/w_160/699547a5.jpg,2008-06-23 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11589-a-perfect-place-ost/,Ipecac,"So many of Mike Patton's projects have been conceptual in nature that context is key to their enjoyment. Factor in that he's a prolific bugger-- appearing in any number of bands, combos, and permutations, playing any number of styles with any degree of commercial or artistic aspirations-- and that's a whole lot of context bogging down his constantly expanding discography. A Perfect Place, for example, is presented as the original motion picture soundtrack to the film of the same name. The art is laid out like a lost Italian thriller, replete with dramatic stills bathed in red. And if the soundtrack weren't packaged with a copy of the film itself, one would be forgiven for presuming the music provided only the theoretical score to a movie that existed only in Patton's mind. The film (written and directed by one Derrick Scocchera, co-founder of Fantoma Films, who last year released a couple of volumes of Kenneth Anger works) is a droll, fitfully funny hardboiled noir/black comedy hybrid, shot in 'Scope and presented it black and white. It also runs just a short 25 minutes. Patton's released score, on the other hand, runs ten minutes over that, which may show where the priorities lie. It's a Patton soundtrack with a bonus DVD, not the other way around. Patton, of course, is a huge film score buff. His band Fantomas pays tribute to the greats (by way of chamber metal), and his Ipecac label released a useful sampler of less than obvious Ennio Morricone music. Predictably, Morricone looms large over much the score, as does the influence of someone like Henry Mancini in Latin jazz/tiki mode, and if the music plays a subtle role in A Perfect Place, Scocchera constantly calls attention to it in the most conspicuous of ways, primarily through its characters fiddling with radios. ""What is that?"" asks one guy as the other scans the dial of a car radio. ""I don't know,"" the other guys responds. ""I've never heard it before. Should I change it?"" ""Eh, keep it on,"" says the first guy. ""I kind of like it."" Subtle the diegetic nod is not. Fortunately, Patton's score isn't nearly as in your face. That cue in question, ""A Perfect Place"", features twang guitar, whistling, and the occasional synth squelch, and sounds right out of the world of Il Maestro. The two cues called ""Car Radio"" are basically just static filled runs across the fuzzy dial, pausing briefly on a number of diverse and strange snippets, while manic percussion occasionally gives a jazzy edge to some of the other cues. The lounge rock of ""A Perfect Twist"" features Patton on vocals, but most of the remaining score veers away from pop and plops instead into the infinitely deep pool of pop culture and kitsch. Even more than Morricone, Patton mentor John Zorn and his own eclectic, semi-experimental soundtracks inform Patton's explorations. Zorn, of course, has released several compilations of Filmworks, collections of music written for films both released and unreleased, obscure and even more obscure. Listening to Patton's bits and pieces, most of which don't hit the three-minute mark, it's easy to imagine him following suit. Surely the guy must have hours of this stuff stowed away. All he needs now, with A Perfect Place as a sort of self-contained calling card, is a few dozen filmmakers giving him a ring to justify unleashing it all.","The prolific Mike Patton delves into film work with a score to a short film, helpfully included in the package.

Same As It Never Was,The Herbaliser,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8113d197565213b0d9/1:1/w_160/c1a70df4.jpeg,2008-06-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11613-same-as-it-never-was/,!K7,"At what point does a hip-hop producer decide to lean towards live instrumentation? Is it something that comes up after years of sample-searching, where months upon months' worth of listening hours and beat dismantling spur a fascination with the original soul or jazz product via reverse-engineering osmosis? Or is it just a growing disenchantment with the idea of plugging away at ProTools? Whatever the motivation, Ninja Tune's longtime resident hip-hop geeks Ollie Teeba and Jake Wherry-- better known as the Herbaliser-- took a gradual but noticeable shift into live-band dynamics over the course of their decade-and-a-half career, solidifying their current incarnation of horn-driven pop-funk bombast on 2005's Take London and finding themselves right at the center of the nu-Swingin' London retro-soul maelstrom that Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse belatedly became the faces of. It's an interesting place for the Herbaliser to wind up, but it's also a perilous one: as one of the more straightforward and unassuming groups to come out of the otherwise avant-blunted mid-late 1990s Ninja Tune camp, their sense of populist feel-goodery only gets more lapel-grabbingly eager-to-please when you factor in blaring brass and Nixon-age demi-kitsch. Like Take London, there's some points on their first post-Ninja Tune release, Same As It Never Was, that threaten to suffocate you in a chortling wave of self-aware schmaltz, like some kind of Mike Myers version of Lalo Schifrin or the John Barry Orchestra. Dopey genre-film-score homages like the cop-show lite-funk clichés of ""Blackwater Drive"" or the bumbling Benny Hill mugging of ""Amores Bongo"" don't radiate much excitement or smarts -- sure, they're kind of funny-ha-ha, but ultimately frivolous and cheesy enough to damage initial impressions of what would otherwise be a well-assembled work of inoffensively likeable pop-funk revivalism. Fortunately, those moments are just speed bumps, and better failed levity than failed grandiosity anyways. When Jake, Ollie, and the Easy Access Orchestra horn section (Andrew Ross and Ralph Lamb) consolidate their efforts into less goofy turf, they come across like a solid set of compatriots to your typical Daptone Records band, sporting a chameleonic modular-soul versatility that doesn't strain too hard to fit into hip-hop turf. Whenever they're playing behind a vocalist, which they do for the majority of the record, they stick to providing a solid backbone and let all the attention focus on whoever's got the mic. So you get Jean Grae, who goes back with the Herbaliser over a decade, fitting a novella's (or a screenplay's) worth of fraternal betrayal and true-crime intricacy inside ""Street Karma (A Cautionary Tale)""-- and suddenly the cop-show vibe that made ""Blackwater Drive"" come across sort of flippantly sounds a lot more intense this time around. And even if the epic-Western tone makes the bounce of ""Just Won't Stop"" sound a bit off, Yungun's sympathetic Luddite laments over YouTube culture and record-shop closings give it some gravity. Then there's Jessica Darling, who appears on five of Same As It Never Was' twelve tracks and gives the album much of its character. A 22-year-old Londoner who sings a bit like a Southern U.S. r&b vet in her late fifties, it's kind of a disconnect to hear her go all Jean Knight on some assorted Mssrs. Big Stuff in ""You're Not All That"" or paraphrasing Smokey Robinson's lyrics for ""Get Ready"" on ""Can't Help This Feeling"". But the displacement in era and culture and continent aren't really what makes her voice surprisingly appealing-- she just sounds comfortably fierce and high-energy, a belter who's a little too raspy and rough for your more polite coffeehouses (though closer ""Stranded on Earth"" proves she can work chillout duty just fine). Even as the post-Winehouse fragmentation of nu-soul drops artists into bleached pockets of mannered, by-the-numbers nostalgia (have they green-lit The Commitments II yet?), Same As It Never Was at least risks something-- and when it's not tripping over its clownish go-go boots, it makes a good-enough case for going all the way live.","Trip-hop vets continue their move from samples to live instrumentation and now find themselves comfortably enmeshed in the nu-Swingin' London retro-soul maelstrom.

Vasco EP Part 1,Ricardo Villalobos,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb99abf31b7dc7155b15/1:1/w_160/2e49a0a8.jpeg,2008-06-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11920-vasco-ep-part-1/,Perlon,"With a few exceptions (including, but not limited to, his wiry and emotional debut album Alcachofa, the gorgeous Achso EP, and many of his perkier remixes), Ricardo Villalobos has spent the past five years or so mining that corner of minimal house where ""nothing happening"" becomes a happening, uncovering moments of magic-eye shifts in perception when privation is transformed into an embarrassment of riches. Last year's Fabric 36, a mixed-together compendium of new Villalobos productions, pushed this absence-excess dynamic to its extremes, its delirium of quietly overlapping rhythms and uncomfortable vocal samples verging on being too-much of that not-enough that constitutes the producer's odd charm. I use ""charm"" deliberately here: The word ""genius"" gets bandied about just a little too easily with this guy, though you can see what people are aiming for when they make the claim. There's an inscrutable quality to Ricardo's music that makes him seem way ahead of any curve you're on, and this sense of a higher intelligence is seductive even when the music fails to be. ""It's not him,"" I've often thought when a particular Villalobos track has left me cold, ""it's me."" Villalobos seems to be pushing the less-is-more line further and further these days; but then, he's getting better at it, or at least more fluent. With his latest double-LP release Vasco EP Part 1 (yep, that's two pieces of vinyl for four tracks, and it's only part one) he retreats slightly from the through-the-wormhole (or at least k-hole) antics of Fabric 36 and its sister vinyl release Sei Es Drum, for a partial return to basic house principles. But unlike the compulsive swing of his recent remix of Shinedoe's ""Phunk"", or his remarkably catchy, hype-inducing DJ tool ""Enfants (Chants)"", Vasco has no truck with house's traditional pleasures. On ""Minimoonstar"", one of two new productions included, melody is abandoned almost entirely, in favor of rippling drums and a quirky, xylophone-like bassline that slides around uneasily for 13 minutes. Taken as a whole, its radical uneventfulness is perverse, but at any given moment the sheer delicacy of its sound (in particular its bruised, radioactive bass tones) is bewitching. Still, it's hard not to suspect that Villalobos' increasingly hardline stance against structure, dynamic, and linearity is undermining the execution somewhat: *""*Minimoonstar"" crests at about six minutes, with eerie ambient washes giving a sense of significance-- if not exactly purpose-- to its aimless meanderings; but Villalobos then seems to shy away from the pathos he hints towards, drifting instead into doldrums of fitful kicks whose game-faced emptiness is frustrating more than enigmatic. His reluctance to force emotions onto his audience is noble in some ways, but as listeners sometimes we need to be manipulated. Perhaps this sense of trailing off wouldn't be so stark if Vasco didn't include a stunning remix of ""Minimoonstar"" by Shackleton, the erstwhile dubstep producer now increasingly determined to beat all the Germans at their own games. While never seeming overtly structured, Shackleton's remix drifts organically through several movements that build in intensity with a lethal grace. As with his own recent track ""Death Is Not Final"", here he uses a pulsing 4X4 kickdrum less as a concession to house groove than as a nominal structure around which his rhythmic excursions can roam even more willfully than before: the astonishing middle section contrasts a solemn house pulse with ringing and melodramatic widescreen percussive patterns that sound like stones skipping across the surface of a bottomless lake, unabashedly evoking a kind of spiritual agoraphobia. Despite its title, Villalobos' second track, ""Electronic Water"", is by far the less fluid, opting for an awkward, fidgety groove that promises less but ultimately delivers more, its wired-up nervousness culminating in a closing stretch of compulsive computer funk that's as smile-inducing as anything in the producer's back catalogue. Still shunning melody or emotion, ""Electronic Water"" at least embraces narrative, moving logically from near-formless substance towards a semblance of chattering electro that's pure form. Remixer San Proper takes this idea further, enclosing the entire thing in a cavernous but insistent house groove that sacrifices little if any of the original's unpredictable rhythmic spikiness. Villalobos acolytes will doubtless make sneering references to functionalism and hidebound DJs-- you'll know them because they will be unable to say anything bad about anything Villalobos has ever done-- which misses the point somewhat: A good deal of the attraction of the original ""Electronic Water"" lies in how it almost seems to yearn towards becoming proper house, its rhythms probing blindly for some kind of stable reference. In fact, taken together, Shackleton and San Proper's efforts feel like the logical conclusions that Villalobos deliberately leaves off the page, although they're conclusions that tend in opposite directions, with San Proper embracing sensuality and Shackleton thematic soundscaping. Vasco is not an album for the uninitiated, or for those looking for another way into the producer's bewildering and labyrinthine aesthetic; it's less an album than a survey, less a statement than a question mark. If Villalobos' hypnotic excursions into ""nothing happening"" are by now their own genre-- and let's accept that they are-- then Vasco asks what kind of nothing we want to happen, and whether Villalobos is the guy to give it to us. Shackleton carries the day here (if only just) because he reminds us of how devastating Villalobos himself can be when he's prepared to meet us halfway, still ahead of the curve, but glancing back to where we are, and trying to put into words we'll understand the indescribable things he's seen.","By this point, Ricardo Villalobos' hypnotic and sometimes inscrutable excursions into minimalism are practically their own genre; his latest release retreats slightly from the through-the-wormhole antics of Fabric 36 and its sister vinyl release Sei Es Drum, for a partial return to basic house principles.

Exile in Guyville [15th Anniversary Edition],Liz Phair,by: Chris Dahlen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9aea9e61561daa729a/1:1/w_160/05175b35.jpeg,2008-06-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11921-exile-in-guyville-15th-anniversary/,Liz Phair,"You break all kinds of unwritten rules when you're a guy who admires a girl. The white suburban kids who idolize gangster rappers are old news, and the rich kids have always loved to rub elbows with the poor. But when a man tries to identify with a woman, he doesn't just hit the normal problems of ""white male gaze"" and ""exploitation of the other"" and ""being a jackass"": There's also the third rail of male sexuality, where identifying too closely with a woman might make you seem, perish the thought, sensitive. So instead, the guys who dig a girl like Liz Phair have to play up the attraction, the lust, the submission to a rock'n'roll goddess-- even when, for many of them, the lust ain't the main draw. The other tactic is to take credit for what she's done. And guys can take plenty of credit for Phair's early career. Rock critics like Bill Wyman brought Phair to Chicago's attention when they ranted and raved about Guyville weeks before the thing came out. The Rolling Stones recorded Exile on Main Street, the loose template for Guyville's 18 tracks-- and one of the blues-rock genomes that saved this from being just another singer-songwriter set. And a couple other guys, co-producer Brad Wood and engineer Casey Rice, helped nail the minimalist production of Guyville and its follow-up, the underrated Whip-Smart. It was the guys like her Johnny or her Joe-- the titular guys in the indie boy's club centered in and around Chicago's Wicker Park-- who preened for her, dicked her over, and taught her how to push back, inspiring her and making it necessary for her to write these songs in the first place. And it was guys who took the piss when she started headlining at venues that were too big for an amateur. Playing a New Year's Eve show at the Metro as your sixth or seventh gig is a lot to bite off. And if I recall correctly, she bit. But stagecraft and starpower weren't the point: Those of us who were taken in by Phair loved her because she was-- sorry to use the word-- real. Men and women have written paeons to Phair since Guyville was released, putting her swagger, strength, and mundanity in whatever context meant the most to them-- ""girl next door,"" ""older sister,"" ""younger sister,"" ""easy lay,"" ""slut next door,"" ""bitch."" But let's start with ""female rocker."" Guyville still runs up your spine on track one with its full-on opener, ""6'1'"", which is the best song she's ever recorded: tough but exposed, with cute feints in the lyrics, a wicked riff, and the door slamming open on her sassy tomboy vocals. On cuts like these, guys can dig Phair because she's one of the guys. The songs are mostly sprints or drones, and on relistening to it, it's striking to hear the full-band cuts next to the solitary head space of songs like ""Glory"" or ""Shatter"", where she's backed more by a memory of guitar than by the raunchy blues-rock of the album's other half. The production of the ballads replicates the intimacy of a bedroom recording without the tape hiss or bum notes, which is an awesome illusion; and only a beginning songwriter could make such elemental riffs sound so exciting. Phair has famously struggled to become a star, and never quite made it. Guyville turned her into an object of fascination, but those early gigs revealed she wasn't a superstar: She had to get by on talent, and perceptiveness. She has the gift of turning everyday downers into rock, and the shock came when she sang about things that nobody else discussed in public. The cover shot nipple, ""I want to be your blow job queen,"" the outro of ""Fuck and Run"" (""...even when I was 12"")-- this stuff was startling at the time, but I'm guessing it won't register with any teenagers who discover this today. You can get Savage Love right on your cell phone, and young adults today can browse mainstream blogs and read about machines that will fuck you. Sad to say that at the time, it was shocking to talk about non-missionary sex with the girl you could take home to mom, but today, on ""Flower""-- the one about blow jobs-- the line that surprises is her Dungeons & Dragons-like reference to ""minions.” (On the original, she said she'd fuck the guy's girlfriend.) Also hard to explain would be the sound, which is grey and wedged entirely in the midrange. When a ""remastered"" edition was announced, I had to wonder if the remasterer had actually heard the thing before taking the job-- but hearing it now, the treatment works: the rhythm section, when there is one, has more punch, and Phair's vocals come a little closer to your earlobe. The package also comes with a poorly-made DVD of interviews that Phair conducted with people from Chicago who knew her when-- Steve Albini, Ira Glass, the Urge Overkill guys. It makes a scene that fancied itself ""the next Seattle"" seem exactly as insular and provincial as it really was. More useful would have been a tighter focus on Phair-- say, a better set of her B-sides and demos. Would it have killed ATO to throw in more of her early, even less-inhibited Girly Sounds material? Three B-sides grace this reissue, including the meandering ""Ant in Alaska"" and a curious cover of Lynn Tait's ""Say You"". They're nice throwaways, but they explain little about what was going on around the making of her debut. Fifteen years on, Guyville occasionally sounds dated-- for its particular sexiness, and its particular indieness. But the songwriting holds up. She ticks off all the bruises and embarrassments of relationships, and never lets her defenses get in the way. Naturally as a guy, I can't speak for what women saw in the record back then, or how young women will take it now. But of all the albums written from a woman's perspective, this is one of the most accessible to men. It's intriguing to watch her deal with us-- not as a mere revolutionary, but as someone who knows that sex will always be tough, so she always has to be tougher. She's been tested in ways we never will be, and we understand just enough to admire her for it. Men don't get what it's like to be a woman. But spinning this record, you swear that you could.",,9.6,
Violets,Twine,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb7eea9e61561daa725d/1:1/w_160/e797d713.jpg,2008-06-20 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11611-violets/,Ghostly,"The artwork of Violets features scenes from a building in pleasant disrepair. Papers scattered and walls sea-green in morning light, it's the type of squat-able city residence you'd expect to find an art collective haunting. The photos serve Twine's inviting electronic scribbles well, but unlike some of their sound-art peers-- Fennesz, Tim Hecker, Gastr Del Sol-- whose work suggests entropy or decay, Twine's compositions sound like careful reconstructions of the decayed. A mix of twitching electronics, long, semi-coherent samples, and lapping melodic figures, Violets suggests painting a wall to peel or building stairs to creak. Like a peek into the off-limits bedroom of a high school crush, much of Violets serves as fascinating melancholy. Snippets of voice, both sampled and recorded, float in and out of the album's chambers, vying for time with doped-down rhythm tracks and slo-mo guitar. On their fourth album and second for Ghostly International, Greg Malcolm and Chad Mossholder have mastered these atmosphere-heavy pills, to the point where ""there's nothing new under the sun"" would be apt criticism if any part of Violets-- save its cover art-- suggested the sun would come out tomorrow. The penultimate ""Lightrain"" uses a now-anachronistic answering machine, the device's junkyard destiny straining its recordings far more than the curtain of buzz and dewy piano they're forced to fight through. Two female guest vocalists-- Alison Shaw (of Cranes) and Gail Schadt-- offer mostly seamless cooing as a windy reprieve from Violets' claustrophobia. But while Twine clearly seek to ply their doom with disconnected voices, their discordant, mordant guitar work is the battery that powers Violets. ""Disconnected"" is the simplest track here, but it offers a weird inversion of melody/rhythm relationship: a pendulous electric guitar-- one that wouldn't be out of place on one of fellow Ohioan Jason Molina's doom-folk records-- strains out chords in slow-clap time while a combustible beat sputters on like its drum machine blew a sparkplug. The title track places a preacher under trance-metal guitar while a xylophone-synth line offers the tiniest of sonic counterpoints. It is indicative of Violets' overarching mood that opener ""Small"" features a barely ascendant melody line that plays under a recording of heavy rain. Whatever its pieces, Twine's compositions rarely disguise their origins: instruments, voices, and electronics remain mostly separate. Violets can seem fatigued and depressed without reason or release, but its hardships are lessened because Twine always allow listeners insight into their structure. ""Longsided"" condenses Twine's strengths and failings: the track begins with a rough male voice bitching about lodging over a phone. Over the next seven minutes the track ping-pongs between industrial noise, ominous drone, and glitchy beats. It's a fucking mess, and it highlights a sense of restlessness that runs through Violets: tracks like ""Counting Off Again"" and ""Piano"" from Twine's eponymous 2003 album found a hard-won compromise between familiar atmosphere and sonic ingenuity. Violets seems to abandon the latter half of that deal, sounding relatively conventional, or at least as conventional as a band can be inside the realm of sweaty, mush-brained sound dramas. At their best, Twine can sound like they're matting Silly Putty against the Books and then stretching and distorting the resultant print, using their beefy track lengths to elongate the silences between words and flirt with numbing repetition. Violets offers plenty more of these weirdly personal in-betweens, but they're starting to feel less weird.","Electro-acoustic duo on Ghostly return with an album of compositions-- built mostly with guitar, bits of piano, subtle processing, and voices-- that sound like careful reconstructions of the decayed.

Ghost Town,Dan Friel,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb965e6ef95969322c47/1:1/w_160/fa3a6670.jpeg,2008-06-20 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11918-ghost-town/,Important,"As one of dual frontmen in Parts & Labor, Dan Friel takes the disobedient squeals of keyboards and other sundry electronics and marries them to more familiar contexts, making otherwise jaw-clenching noise surprisingly palatable while helping the two- to three-chord punk anthem sound new again. On his solo record Ghost Town, he's using many of those same glassy, treble-heavy electronic tones, but just as P&L can replace guitar and bass with unfamiliar sqeals, Friel goes further and replaces the drums, the vocals, and pretty much the whole band with the wheeze and skronk of electronic instruments. Even as he abandons traditional rock instruments, he bends his new toys to the particular vision of his better-known band-- that is, to twist noise until it's basically pop. Opening track ""Ghost Town Pt. 1"" builds slowly from honking and sputtering into a thunderous bass chug, setting a rhythm that almost overwhelms its prideful 8-bit-like theme. That same deep, distorted bass is the bedrock of ""Desert Song"", though its melody is woozier and less distinct than the album opener; high-pitched whistles mark out more video-game territory, but they slide in and out of tune as the cascading mechanical beats take the foreground. ""Buzzards"" is almost a pocket-sized rave, its rhythm relentless, its keyboards drunkenly melodic, its background whistling and wheezing demanding more and more. The quiet ring of ""Ghost Town Pt. 2"" has a dog-whistle melody countered by a theremin-like tone, but they fold over each other and slowly recede into another ear-piercer and hip-shaker. From its extended intro to its slow-burning melody matched to a tireless rhythm, it's a distinctly rock move that unfolds like many of P&L's monster singles. But Ghost Town is far more than just demos for Friel's other band, which you can tell from its forays into a more desolate and mournful atmosphere. The hiccuping ringtone beat of ""One Legged Cowboy"" could fit in with the minimal, melodic IDM Thom Yorke ventured into on his solo album, and its quiet whistles are lonely and almost kitschy as the track's open space begins to evoke the album's title. The same goes for closing track ""Horse Heaven"", which could almost soundtrack the closing scenes of a Western with its low-battery siren melody augmented by far-away church organ over the slow, inevitable march of its rhythm. As it is with Friel's day job, your mileage with this may vary depending on either how you noisy you like your pop, or how poppy you like your noise. However, the fact that Friel has accomplished the same ends in a much more difficult context, all while adding his own distinctive and personal touch, is no small feat.","On his latest solo record, Parts & Labor's Dan Friel replaces the drums, the vocals, and pretty much the whole band with the wheeze and skronk of electronic instruments, in the process twisting noise until it's basically pop.

The Ken Burns Effect,Stars Like Fleas,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b66e5e6ef95969322931/1:1/w_160/3e00b379.jpg,2008-06-20 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11578-the-ken-burns-effect/,Hometapes,"Please, stop right there. Certainly by now, you've noticed the numerical rating several pixels above this second sentence, and you're already thinking, ""Another 7.something. No time for this."" Your pointer is above the back button, your finger on the trigger. Don't do it, please: Over the past two months, I've listened to The Ken Burns Effect, the second proper record from New York-centered collective Stars Like Fleas, about 50 times, and I'm about as close to offering a conclusion now as I was around spin five. The number above is a suggestion to listen but also a waiver to go right back to your Fleet Foxes or Lil Wayne if need be. That is, it's an absolute indication of quality, not a guarantee you'll find your new favorite band. The Ken Burns Effect is one of the year's most ambitious and daring records, blessed, beset and united by the desire to steer clear of indie rock's middle road, to be ambitiously good. It loses and wins big, sometimes in the same song, sometimes in the same verse. But, at the very least, just as you shouldn't pass on a band because of an inane name like Stars Like Fleas, records this cared for shouldn't be skipped because of a rating. Sometimes, I think The Ken Burns Effect deserves a 10.0. Sometimes, it feels like a 2.0. You might hate it. You might love it. But you need to hear it. Stars Like Fleas deals mostly in symphonic pop de-/reconstructions, building around the words of co-architect Montgomery Knott with elaborate stacks of melodies and slingshot maneuvers that dart through seemingly linear movements. No moment of The Ken Burns Effect suggests the path of least resistance. Even the band's pop ideal, the three-minute ""Berbers in Tennis Shoes"", twists contexts and introduces unease. ""Berbers"" bounces to a steady, springy rhythm, and wide, arching horn-and-string arrangements lift its four sections up and along. But such relative rhythmic stability clashes with the song's broader sonic dual: Banjo, glockenspiel, harp, flute, and a flugelhorn guide the melody along, but a current of dissonance-- occasional sharps and flats from the pretty instruments and an electric guitar that threatens to raze the whole thing with noise-- runs like a bright blue vein beneath otherwise unblemished skin. And Knott isn't selling you on empty sentiments, either: ""Have you slept with your fill of men?"" he asks acerbically, later indicting with the suggestion, ""Money saved for those who were fucking you."" Similarly, ""Karma's Hoax"", which opens the album after a collagist introduction, pits skittering drums and squawking bass clarinet and baritone saxophone beneath beautiful dream-like vocals, pedal steel moans and patient piano chords. The drums and horns temporarily overrun the song's softer side, slapping at the theme like Albert Ayler letting ""Spirits Rejoice"" with Fred Frith and Joey Baron. Fortunately, Stars Like Fleas don't use their philosophy of flourishes just to corrode or provide wrinkles. ""I Was Only Dancing"" is a simple country-ish creeper-- steady drums, banjo, and acoustic guitar gliding under Knott. He sounds most comfortable somewhere between Dave Matthews and Chris Martin, quietly insistent but capable of rising into choral resplendence when needed. The band forces his voice here, and, in turn, they help deliver one of the record's best moments. Even though Knott's words indicate deep desperation, the chorus-- lifted by good company-- sounds like the darkest clouds broken by the brightest sunlight must look. Continuing sounds possible, enjoyable even. And there's ""Falstaff"", which reads less like a ""song"" and more an like elliptical, illusory verse entwined into a glorious musical setting. Those free drums return, dispersing the rhythm into a gorgeous matrix of sound. Trilled violins flash low in the mix. Single piano notes rise, hover, dissipate. Sharp dobro licks cut through it all, like a sharp knife made gorgeous by craftsmanship. Even without vocals, you'd never forget ""Falstaff"" and its strangely interlocking whorls. Those compositional complexities and wormholes stem somewhat from the band's foundation and evolution. Stars Like Fleas has long been Knott and Shannon Fields, together forming ideas, then organizing a sprawling core of part-time members and collaborators to expand them. No less than 21 people-- from Sam Amidon and Espers' Jesse Sparhawk to former Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn-- contribute to The Ken Burns Effect. While most of the additions work, such loose collaboration is the double-edged sword that likely shaved the number up top that everybody's so worried about. Some of the ideas feel slightly pedantic-- like an (admittedly accomplished) microtonal drone that introduces ""Toast Siren""-- or even lazy, like the token electronic beat that rattles after the drums on ""You Are My Memoir"". By adding too much to a song, Stars Like Fleas occasionally diminish the mass of their own accomplishments, reducing the gravity of the best moments. You're left floating. Moving quickly from one allusion or clipped phrase to the next, Knott's words sometimes do the same. Eventually, though the band will bring you back. I can promise that, even if I can't make any promises about that pesky 7.5.","Latest from the Brooklyn symphonic pop collective led by multi-instrumentalist and producer Shannon Fields and vocalist Montgomery Knott is dense, challenging, and ultimately rewarding.

A Thousand Shark's Teeth,My Brightest Diamond,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb975e6ef95969322c4a/1:1/w_160/f80acc9a.jpg,2008-06-20 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11919-a-thousand-sharks-teeth/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Back in 2006, an opera student from New York City named Rachel Zevita auditioned for ""American Idol"". Armed with a bright personality and even brighter hippie duds, she convincingly sang Jeff Buckley's ""Eternal Life"" and lite-soul classic ""Get Here"", along with some glass-shattering opera blasts. It was not your typical ""Idol"" try-out. At the end of the eclectic vocal exhibition, Simon Cowell asked her: ""Who would you like to be?"" If Shara Worden-- the opera-trained leader of New York City's My Brightest Diamond-- was a little younger and a lot more desperate for attention, she could've been that ""Idol"" oddity. Able to tackle everything from a drum 'n' bass version of ""When Doves Cry"" to a foot-stomping take on Nina Simone's ""Be My Husband"" to a karaoke-hustling ""I Will Always Love You"" with shocking ease live, Worden's voice is one of the most astounding in all of indie rock. But, after listening to her dark, impressionistic sophomore album and then watching her crack bassoon jokes and mimic Michael Jackson at a recent show, I'm left with the same question as Cowell: Who would Shara Worden like to be? According to MBD's head-snapping debut, Bring Me the Workhorse, the singer-songwriter-arranger-musical omnivore wanted to be the female Jeff Buckley with a more pronounced perfectionist bent and without sex. She brooded about unspeakable terribleness, dead bugs, talking dragonflies and glue factory-bound horses with the seriousness of a ghostly naturalist. Even more, she turned what should've been an overreaching neo-transcendental nightmare into something even the most protective Buckley-phile would swoon over. Worden's heady, music school talents were apparent but not overbearing and she tempered her flower child side with considerable menace. The first track on A Thousand Shark's Teeth, ""Inside a Boy"", continues with this winning formula. The rest of the album does not. Originally conceived as a record full of string quartet pieces, Shark's Teeth was always bound to be a riskier affair than the more straightforward Workhorse. Though the strings-only mandate fell by the wayside somewhere along the LP's six-year gestation, its Debussy-inspired impressionistic flourishes remain. Songs often sidestep repetitive structures in favor of more meandering paths. Woodwinds and strings follow elaborate charts. These more mannered experiments start off curiously pleasing. ""Ice and the Storm"" quickly rebukes the infatuation of ""Inside a Boy"" as it chronicles the quivering finale of a relationship with human nature intact: ""I want a storm to blow it out/ I want to shake myself and turn my heart inside out,"" wails Worden, while all sorts of harps, choirs and skittering snares turn her wants into realities. ""If I Were Queen"", meanwhile, lovingly mixes the fantastical with the mundane. Over delicate strings, Worden uses her hypothetical royalty to bring a distant loved one closer just so they can ""collect things and argue where to put them"" together. The playful ""Apples"" somehow makes folding clothes sexy, and album centerpiece ""From the Top of the World"" is the most exquisite thing on the disc, its celestial marriage vows working in perfect tandem with an immaculate symphony underneath. The latter half of the record quickly falls into a mid tempo malaise, though, with Worden's ethereal references to the heavens growing staler with each overly precious arrangement. The first part of the nearly seven minute ""To Pluto's Moon"" sounds like a sub par tribute to Björk's insular masterpiece Vespertine, while the second part veers dangerously close to trip-hop wallpaper. The indulgences begin to overwhelm and, by the end of the album, Worden's fantastical charm turns itself inside out. It's too posed for its own good. Frustratingly, what should be the album's best song isn't on the album. A recent live favorite, ""The Gentlest Gentleman"" is available only as a bonus track on iTunes (it's also currently streaming for free on MBD's site). Thematically, the exclusion makes sense; ""Gentleman"" is a stunningly simple ukulele ditty that goes down easy after Shark's Teeth's orchestral intricacies. It's also the most direct My Brightest Diamond song to date, with Worden saying goodbye to a loved one with understated grace. ""If this is to be the end well, hey, that's it,"" she shrugs, resigned but resilient. A creative chameleon with endless wells of technical skill, Worden stuffs Shark's Teeth with studied know-how. ""Gentleman"" bypasses such careful intelligence-- it gives the singer away more than a thousand of violins ever could.","After a head-snapping debut that recalled Jeff Buckley, Shara Worden's second record-- originally conceived as an album full of string quartet pieces-- was always bound to be a riskier affair.

So it was pretty exciting when the two bands merged to form White Rock, with Double Leopards' Mike Bernstein and Maya Miller joining Mouthus' Brian Sullivan and Nate Nelson. Their 2005 album Tarpit (named after their communal quarters) mixed enveloping soundscapes with disjointed sludge, approaching the best work of either band. Religious Knives, another Mouthus/Double Leopards collaboration, is a different proposition, but one that's becoming even more exciting. The group began as the trio of Bernstein, Miller, and Nelson (bassist Todd Cavallo has since joined in), and are a much more conventional group than White Rock. With Bernstein on guitar and vocals, Miller on organ, and Nelson on a more standard drum kit than the electronic-acoustic hybrid he plays in Mouthus, the band even looks like a power trio on stage. This is a sharp contrast to Double Leopards, who crouch around their instruments and prefer to face each other rather than the audience. The first few Religious Knives releases were rather noisy, but hints of melody and beat gradually slipped in. Following that path, the group has now found its strongest voice, a 1960s-ish trance-jam sound touching on garage, krautrock, and even Doors-style organ-pop (it's telling that a recent live CD includes a cover of ? and the Mysterians' ""96 Tears""). Atop Nelson's looping rhythms and Miller's hypnotic chords, Bernstein-- an unabashed fan of Neil Young and the Grateful Dead-- pours his guitar like syrup over pancakes, and moans like a vampire afraid of sunlight. The result is the musical equivalent of a slow-rolling storm cloud. Religious Knives songs seem to hang in the air and move forward, leaving thick trails of echo behind. Resin is their best record yet. Compiled from singles, split releases, and live sets, it has the coherence of a studio album. The best songs offer simple melodies rising like beams of light through fog: ""Everything Happens Twice"" melts Nelson's marching beat into a Can-like jam, while ""The Sun"" fuses Miller's Manzarek-ish chords to swaying fuzz. Even the album's loosest tracks-- like the open-ended ""Twelve Bottles and One White Cone""-- have an urgency that's oddly catchy. Religious Knives' affinity for drone is never far away, but the melodies are what make Resin so enticing. It's After Dark, recorded by the trio version of the band and produced by Samara Lubelski at Rare Book Room Studios, opens with the same kind of blood-flow that Resin courses with. ""In Brooklyn After Dark"" chugs forward for 11 dense minutes, as Bernstein hums stoned musings about the band's home: ""In Brooklyn after dark/ The helicopters are the birds...The children all have gray hair/ They stare and stare and stare and stare."" But the rest of the album isn't quite so energetic. Most tracks are slow and subdued, with Nelson's beats more relaxed, and Bernstein and Miller sounding generally dreamier. Even a different version of ""The Sun"" meanders in comparison to Resin's strident take. Not that Religious Knives aren't good at being mellow-- the haunted-house jam ""It's Hot"" and the Terry Riley-esque ""Noontime"" are mesmerizing enough to dilate any eyes. But It's After Dark is just a bit more uniform, just a bit less urgent, than Resin. Still, these two releases are the band's peak so far, and show a growth that suggests they too will be bested, and probably soon.","Pedal-pushing droners Double Leopards and heavy rock deconstructionists Mouthus come together as Religious Knives on two new releases.

We Started Nothing,The Ting Tings,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb685e6ef95969322be4/1:1/w_160/a9f8fcb3.jpg,2008-06-19 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11594-we-started-nothing/,Sony,"For a reasonable price, English indie-pop duo the Ting Tings are selling anti-establishment ""fuck you""'s by the bottle. Plus some barely serviceable party tunes. And, oh yeah, they're kinda sexy, too. Actually, it's tough to tell exactly which readymade, tongue-in-cheek pop angle they're adopting, but the duo's genesis unequivocally stems from a mutual jadedness towards the record industry. Both Katie White and Jules De Martino cut their teeth in teenage pop groups only to see their music career as adults hamstrung by bum record deals and one false start after another. Bent on seeking vengeance, the pair packs loads of not-so-subtle jabs at the industry into their spotlight-hungry debut, but despite the tough talk, they can't avoid sounding like the simplistic saccharine pop lifers they are. Of course, no one expects an album like We Started Nothing to carry the torch for subversive, incendiary popular song (see Robyn, Santogold, and M.I.A., among others, for that); we just demand good hooks and lots of 'em. Any hand-wringing over the Ting Tings's conceit as Top 40 mutineers is rendered moot by the inadequacy of their pop craftsmanship. Shticks may make for easy initial criticism, especially with great pop acts already straddling the lines between the charts and indie (cf. Lily Allen, the Pipettes, Annie), but when a band sport featherweight singles like ""Shut Up and Let Me Go"" and ""That's Not My Name"", they'd be lucky if listeners pay attention long enough to even notice their bit. The duo self-produced Nothing and, thanks to their hefty experience, they accurately cop pretty much any genre they want, from fratty new wave to mopey twee-pop. Problem is, they pay little attention to detail. On a breezy summer jam like single ""Great DJ"", this can pass as shrewd understatement, but other tracks don't benefit from the same. ""Fruit Machine"" is a grinding bitchslap that never really connects, wanting so badly to sound just a smidgen as tough as Peaches or M.I.A. but inevitably melting into painfully adorable, boring Toni Basil cadences. When the time comes to really crank up the party engine, White and De Martino prove even more shorthanded. After club-footed dance numbers ""We Walk"" and ""Shut Up and Let Me Go"" sink the album, the duo tries to bring it home with the six minute-plus self-titled closer, a seemingly endless, riff-less stab at B-52's bacchanalia that never gets off the ground. Maybe it's my own vengeful sadism talking, but the Ting Tings sound much more engaging when sad. ""Be the One"" and ""Traffic Light"" may not possess the immediacy to qualify as standout tracks, but the goth-tinged twee of the former and aching lullaby of the latter makes for the most fully fleshed-out ideas amidst a sea of half-baked inklings here. Maybe once the Ting Tings stop trying so hard to convince everyone they're having a good time and start actually having a good time, these cute little ballads will no longer be their sole redeeming quality. For now, we're stuck listening to them flounder for revenge like they haven't learned a damn thing from Shakespeare or The Wrath of Khan.","Ridiculously popular back home in the UK, the Ting Tings' self-produced debut cops everything from fratty new wave to mopey twee-pop.

Begin Civil Twilight,Auburn Lull,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5eeb335119a49eca0b/1:1/w_160/0bc7f3d5.jpeg,2008-06-19 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11586-begin-civil-twilight/,Darla,"Auburn Lull have proven surprisingly hard to forget. Minor members of Michigan's minor space rock scene-- think Burnt Hair Records, Windy and Carl, Mahogany; call it suburbgaze-- the Lansing quartet are now on their fourth Darla release: a reissued 1999 debut, a rarities comp, and two proper full-lengths. And like the copy of Alone I Admire I copped so many years ago in one of those same Michigan suburbs, Begin Civil Twilight reminds of a time when I very nearly bought a Landing record every time I entered a record store and when I actually did buy a used Flying Saucer Attack album every time I entered a record store. Auburn Lull sell a particularly dense, nurtured form of dream-pop that acts as an admirably neutral standard for a genre and scene whose survival instincts have proven cockroach-like. Auburn Lull sport a perfectly shoegaze-y name-- well, perfectly American anyway, as those E'd-up cross-pond Brits wouldn't be caught dead in something so drearily Midwestern-- but even that genre would imply too much grit: Begin Civil Twilight takes far more cues from ambient or even new age music. Guitarist/vocalist Sean Heenan captains the band with a sadistically slow metronome; drummer Jason Wiesinger possesses either otherworldly patience or mountains of sedatives. Along with guitarists/bassists Jason Kolb and Eli Wekenman they resist any and all temptation to create friction or to amass tension. Apply all standard music-critic buzzwords to the guitars: float, drift, languish, glide. Drum patterns are whisked away like accumulated rain from a windshield. Compared to their peers, Auburn Lull are relatively less willing to blur their sounds-- guitars and keyboards mostly meld, but there are traceable lines drawn between the vocals, bass, and drums. The difference seems to arise less out of a desire to produce proper pop music than to not let Heenan's understated delivery and actual melodies go to waste. Opener ""Light Through the Canopy"" peels away to reveal a heavily reverberated Heenan worming his way through a contoured melody: ""This is how it's supposed to go,"" he claims, light/lite guitars wearing threadbare behind him in confirmation. ""Broken Heroes"", Twilight's most overt pop stab, relies on little more than intermittent bass gurgles during the verse, allowing Heenan and wife Elsa room to mourn in unison. ""November's Long Shadows"" (stereotypical song title alert level: Orange) features a curlicue lead guitar that cuts through the ever-present sheen and gives the song a vague college-rock feel. ""Coasts"", ironically, is the closest Twilight comes to propulsion, dancing with a skittish high-hat before stumbling into a jog, little guitar bends and stabs darting in and out of a tastefully martial drum pattern. While the band's lack of saturation has heretofore worked to its advantage, with each successive release Auburn Lull sound less like squirreled-away torch-guarders and more like a veteran group of studio wizards retracing their steps very, very, very slowly. Twilight contains plenty of Auburn Lull autopilot: little tone poems with vague clips of dialogue (""Geneva""), four and five minute swaths of effected guitar (""Civil Twilight""), or blank soundscapes that serve only as cots for pretty acoustic noodling (""Stanfield Echo"" and, most egregiously, the untitled nine-minute closer). These are not offensive compositions, just extraneous ones that seem like dead weight for a band three albums in and capable of lovingly muted pop. Auburn Lull remain charmingly unswayed by time; hearts grow fonder, sure, but metal rusts and shelves dust over, too.","The third proper full-length from these Lansing-based denizens of the Michigan space-rock scene has the dreamy abstraction of ambient music while still touching on pop song structure.

"The Devil, You + Me",The Notwist,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb95eb335119a49eca87/1:1/w_160/6c588a1c.jpg,2008-06-19 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11917-the-devil-you-me/,Domino,"The popular history of the Notwist has been steeped in transformation-- gloomy grunge misanthropes reborn as laptop-pop romantics. But in the six years that have elapsed since the German band's 2002 Stateside breakthrough Neon Golden, the Notwist haven't changed so much as the definition of what it means to be an indie/electronic crossover act. For the Notwist, the gradual adoption of IDM idioms was less a paradigm shift than a complementary outcome, with the clicks and cuts that permeated Neon Golden and its 1998 predecessor Shrink providing a more modern variation of the tape hiss and crackle that formed the intimate ambience to the classic 80s indie-rock records on which brothers Markus and Micha Acher were raised. But since Neon Golden's release, the indie/electronic divide that the Notwist so carefully toed has been obliterated in a flash of strobe lights, with acts like Cut Copy and Hot Chip pushing shy-guy indie-poptronica out of the bedroom and onto discotheque floors; compared to the outsized, big-room ballast of ""Lights and Music"" and ""Over and Over"", the Notwist's brand of mechanized melancholy now seems understated. Of course, the obvious move would be for resident programmer Martin Gretschmann to beef up the beats and set the synths on squelch. But for all of their rhythmic manipulations and percussive precision, the Notwist have always strived to move the heart over the hips. And if anything, their knee-jerk response to indie's current clubland crossover is to head back to the garage: The Devil, You + Me's stellar opening salvo, ""Good Lies"", begins with a bright, jangly guitar riff and a pounding floor-tom beat that mainline Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation, while frontman Markus Acher introduces the anthemic, gently fist-pumped chorus. But the song's euphoric rush-- emphasized by its breakdown/rebuild structure-- is decidedly at odds with the betrayals described within. Acher provides a candid glimpse into a troubled marriage by describing it in terms of the material goods used to prop it up-- ""I remember good lies/ When we carried them home with us/ To our bedside tables and the coffee sets""-- thereby keenly drawing parallels between dysfunctional relationships and the IKEA-furnished apartments that house them: the cool surface appearances barely concealing the soul-deadening sterility. The equally affecting ""Gloomy Planets"" works a similar contrast between expression and repression-- overtop spirited folk-song strums, Acher asks ""why is everything so locked up?"" before the song's ascending, accelerated climax lets it all out in a cathartic gush of tremoled synth tones and motorik motion. Appearing in the first and third positions respectively, ""Good Lies"" and ""Gloomy Planets"" make an early case for The Devil, You + Me as the Notwist's return-to-rock gesture, and the fact that the title track-- a glockenspiel-glistened acoustic lullaby-- is based upon a chorus melody very similar to that of Neon Golden's ""Pick Up the Phone"" might suggest the Notwist are settling into a comfort of zone of sorts. Though they comprise The Devil, You + Me's most immediate moments, these songs aren't the most representative ones on an album that proves to be every bit as intricate in construction and disorienting in effect as its celebrated predecessors. Melody is an absolute, but everything else is fair play: on the unnerving ""Alphabet"", a tense one-chord acoustic strum clears the way for a procession of horror-movie drones, power-drill guitar squall, laser-beam synths clattering drum breaks and incessant sleigh bells-- recalling the soundtracky beat-scapes the Notwist fashioned in 2006's 13 & God collaboration with hip-hoppers Themselves-- all while Acher drops one-liners like ""I won't sing you algebra"" with an eerie sense of calm. Later, on side two, the bedside ballad ""Sleep"" projects a break-of-dawn optimism that's mischievously undercut by piercing glitches and booming dub breaks, the latter of which also form the backbone for the shadowy slow-motion creep of ""On Planet Off"". But even as the mise en scène around him mutates in unexpected, sometimes sinister ways, Acher's voice is unwaveringly poised, an eminently curious instrument that manages to project both disaffection and great concern in the same breath. In contrast to its briskly paced first act, The Devil, You + Me doesn't so much build to a finale as gradually wind itself down, lending the album a sense of anti-climax; in retrospect, it would have been a smart idea to reassign ""Gloomy Planets"" to the home stretch so as to break up the second side's mid-tempo momentum. But even after a six-year siesta, the Notwist's approach to pop music-- exploiting both its formal properties and endless possibilities-- is no less captivating and visionary than before. And when Acher declares himself ""Gone, Gone, Gone"" on the album's sweet, uncannily Nico-esque closing ballad, you're left hoping you won't have to wait another half decade for a reintroduction.","After a lengthy hiatus-- one that has found indie increasingly enthralled with clubland crossovers-- the Notwist finally follow Neon Golden and Shrink with an album every bit as intricate in construction and disorienting in effect as its celebrated predecessors.

The Wake / A Grave Is a Grim Horse,Scott KellySteve Von Till,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6deb335119a49eca2c/1:1/w_160/a440ed80.jpg,2008-06-19 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11688-the-wake-a-grave-is-a-grim-horse/,Neurot,"As metal approaches its fourth decade of existence, it raises the question of what metallers do when they get old. With the help of Viagra, 62 year-old Lemmy of Motörhead is still going strong. Judas Priest's Rob Halford, 56, and Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, almost 50, remain in top shape, vocally and career-wise. Ozzy Osbourne, on the other hand, is showing all of, if not more than, his 59 years. Whether relying on past glories or attempting to fashion new ones, these veterans are still enacting the young man's role that they created: bringing the thunder. Neurosis' Scott Kelly and Steve Von Till have followed a more organic path: turning down the volume. Neurosis are 23 years old, and their discography has progressed accordingly. Once born of concrete, the band became born of earth. Early recordings of savage hardcore punk gave way to varied experimentation-- metal, industrial, tribal, electronic-- and a gravitas that only comes with age. Later records have been exercises in maximal minimalism, shaping deceptively simple ingredients into textural edifices. Yet they're full of space and nakedness. Neurosis' songs require patience, with long periods of brooding before big, bloody payoffs. Kelly and Von Till's solo acoustic careers are really not that different from Neurosis. They're quieter, of course, but they simply distill the band's concerns-- earth, wind, fire, soul-- to their barest essences. Music need not sound heavy to be heavy. Kelly's The Wake relies heavily on this principle. It's mostly just his voice and guitar. The former is appealingly husky, while the latter is starkly minimal. This pairing yields a beauty that's a little bare sometimes. Despite their transparent presentation, the lyrics are oblique: ""The patterns bring truth/ The stars bring vengeance/ The reasons unknown/ There is no why."" Such abstraction can feel wispy, though at times Kelly's guitar gives the songs meat. ""The Searcher"" has a dramatic ascending riff that could be metal if amplified, while ""Catholic Blood"" is like a slow-motion version of Tom Petty's ""Wildflowers"". ""Saturn's Eye"" is sturdier due to counterpoint, as a distorted lap steel guitar keens over Kelly's dirge-like strumming. It's a distant wolf with a fire nearby, and it's shiver-inducing. Von Till's folk is much more full-bodied due to diverse instrumentation. On A Grave Is a Grim Horse, he girds his acoustic guitar with electric guitar, banjo, fiddle, cello, drums, and Hammond organ. The result is a lucid, Nick Drake-esque setting subtly crowned with electricity. Von Till also benefits from covering some masters: Drake, Townes Van Zandt, Lyle Lovett. However, his songs more than stand on their own. The alt-country lament of ""Looking for Dry Land"" could have come from Red House Painters. Pedal steel guitar gently weeps in the twangy ""Western Son"". ""Brigit's Cross"" alternates crackling electric chords with plaintive fiddle lines. A quavering organ illuminates ""The Acre"", which instructs, ""You must work with the acre you are given."" Von Till's not just speaking in metaphor. He moved from the Bay Area to a rural life in Idaho; A Grave is the happy result of a metaller being literally put out to pasture.","Neurosis' two singer/guitarists simultaneously release acoustic, folk-tinged albums.

O,Tilly and the Wall,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20e9d034d5c69bf2ae8/1:1/w_160/dc17b8b2.jpg,2008-06-19 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11619-o/,Team Love,"The cornerstone of the Team Love roster and its first signing, Omaha's Tilly and the Wall are like the aural equivalent of their label's logo-- a pastel-hued cartoon of a bespectacled teenage girl wearing braids and pink headphones with a candy-colored rainbow emanating from her mouth. Over the course of two albums, this unselfconsciously cute and relentlessly earnest quintet has emitted rainbows of their own, delivering exuberant, glittery folk-pop that's bursting with childlike joy and a sincere appreciation for the sloppy, big-hearted wonder of youth. They are a warm-and-fuzzy respite from an indie rock world that's overburdened with too-serious bands trying to make self-important ""art""-- this is, after all, a group with a tap-dancing percussionist-- though their whimsical songs are infused with raucous energy and real emotion. And while their third full-length (called O for the shape of the frame that holds the nameless album's cover artwork) features their most mature songwriting yet, these Peter Pans are still committed to an innately innocent sound that's free of pretense and full of spontaneity and ingenuity. O expands upon Jamie Pressnall's arsenal of tap-shoe percussion, embracing group stomping, cymbals, and live drums to fill out the rhythm section while exploring new ways to manipulate and record their tried-and-true tap sound. With this newfound rhythmic depth, the Tillys' five songwriters can take chances on a few harder-edged tracks. On ode to schoolyard smack-talking ""Pot Kettle Black"", which was recorded in a local school's gym with a 10-person stomp group, the band matches its marching beats with a tough electric guitar melody that struts and stops abruptly, overshadowing its usually lighthearted, buzzy synths. Singer Kianna Alarid, who has always used her girlishly feisty voice to a cheerleader-y effect, unleashes her inner Karen O, wringing distortion from her mic with her acidic, kittenish tones to match the garage-rock assault of the music. And ""Too Excited"", the album's other ""aggressive"" (by Tilly's tender standards) guitar gem, opens with Pressnall's extended tapping intro and evolves into snotty, defiant cacophony that includes a group cheer of a chorus and the dropping of multiple f-bombs. But even on these tracks, amidst their rowdier rhythms and steelier guitars, the Tillys maintain the playful naïveté for which they are known. Despite the evolution of their sound, Tilly and the Wall haven't forgotten about what made them appealing in the first place: bright co-ed harmonies, rousing choruses, and their overall open-hearted good nature. And so they lure you into this rich, multi-dimensional collection with opener ""Tall Tall Grass"", which wouldn't have sounded out of place on their debut. The soaring acoustic number starts out spare, but uses the dreamy interplay between Alarid and Neely Jenkins' sweetly sassy sopranos to take flight amidst a stately piano line and a surprisingly reverb-heavy guitar solo. And elsewhere the band gives in to their penchant for big, sing-along hooks and glorious, celebratory noise. Both ""Jumbler"", which is built on handclaps and off-kilter piano melodies and is studded with horn slides, and the aptly named ""Cacophony"", which makes the most of the band's wealth of vocal talent by layering tangy three-part harmonies over Pressnall's galloping rhythms and some revival tambourines, will remind listeners why they fell in love with this charming band: Because Tilly and the Wall aren't jaded or studiously cool or blasé. Because they know it feels good to stomp your feet and scream at the top of your lungs. Because they haven’t lost their connection to the emotional freedom of childhood-- that moment in time when you feel the rawness of your emotions, but haven't learned to be ashamed of them yet.",,7.6,
Real Close Ones,The M's,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb67ea9e61561daa721d/1:1/w_160/6f6408ed.jpg,2008-06-18 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11593-real-close-ones/,Polyvinyl,"Regardless of their still-burgeoning profile and local-hero charm, the supreme confidence of the M's has been apparent from the very beginning. From their first eponymous EP onwards, they've written simple, soaring melodies and cobbled together anthemic rock from the glam of Bowie and T. Rex, the saccharine tunes of the Kinks and later Britpop, and the alternately scrappy and surging guitars of 90s American indie. It's the band's knack for making all that seem natural and effortless that's made them worth revisiting with each release, but on their third record that confidence has manifested itself in a different way: rather than barnstorming, the M's on Real Close Ones are starting to sound aloof. They subtract elements once integral to their sound, add a few no one saw coming, and pay unhurried homage to artists they've never nodded to before. If previous records had them pulling all the cool records out for new guests, Real Close Ones is what you'd hear on your ninth or tenth visit to the M's' apartment. Congratulations; you're bros now. Part of that aforementioned confidence surely stems from the members' time spent in earlier bands. Three-fourths of the M's originally started in psych-pop outfit Sanoponic, and those roots are beginning to make themselves heard in these 13 songs. So while ""Big Sound"" starts things off with the weaving urgency you'd expect from the M's, its fuzzy production and seemingly anemic low-end sounds at first like something is missing-- like a car coming down the street without a windshield. ""Breakfast Score"" restores the ample low-end, but they soon add violin presets that would normally only fly in the haze of modern psych-pop. It reads like it should be at odds with the band's guitar-driven rock, and it's jarring at first, but it's incorporated with the same deliciously disinterested manner as any other part of their pastiche. The guitar tone in ""Pigs Fly"" has gone for days without water, but the echo on the vocals serves the yearning harmonies perfectly, and some spacey Rhodes floating over it makes for the dreamy, sun-bleached highlight of the disc. ""Don't Be Late"" is tentative acoustic pop that phases in and out, as if being heard across the street through mid-day traffic, and ""Papers"" gets smokier with gurgling bass tones, lazy drum machine beats, and backwards guitar-- all sewn together into coy, crooning pop. The guitar intro for ""Get Your Shit Together"" is jagged indie with serious soul, but it's merely a segue into another woozy glam rock we've come to expect from the band, with some extra honking bass and a bit of Harry Nilsson's cracked swagger. Speaking of: ""Naked"" could be a dead ringer for ""Coconut"", a self-admittedly creepy ditty about where and why nudity can happen that never raises its voice above a drunken slur. ""Ultraviolent Men"" begins as careless drum-machine pop, but the chorus once again shows the band's knack for melodies that blossom from nowhere in moments of subtle surprise. ""Impossible View"" is a swinging rocker toting a formidable low-end, though it may get its strength simply by standing next to the album's many diversions, not to mention the impossibly annoying chorus of ""Bros in Arms"". After that, tracks like the largely acoustic ""Tryin To Keep"" or the tireless Beatles worship of ""Days in the Sun"" end the record on an extended and lethargic denouement. Following their first two crunching and careening albums, it may seem as if the M's have lowered the bar for themselves, but through all the detours they've made an album that sounds more like themselves than any previous work. There's more personality here than pastiche, and that bodes extremely well.","Chicago band with a fondness for the Kinks, glam-rock, and 1990s indie expands its psych-pop sound in a satisfying direction.

Apocalypso,The Presets,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6bea9e61561daa722c/1:1/w_160/6cab837e.jpg,2008-06-18 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11596-apocalypso/,Modular,"Ignore that score, kind of! You are reading a rave, the only tire-slashing stipulation being that this duo can only achieve so much subglory, even at their finest! I actually like the great cynical joke that the Presets went to conservatory but anti-compositionally named their band after authorless automation. Seriously, hating on the Presets is like hating on Cheetos. You know damn well what you're getting, that the product leaves fingerstains, and that it is not ""good,"" but can still be a tad awesome, occasionally. Having a Presets jam stuck in your head, though, is akin to holding a crinkly orange bag of that aforementioned snack up to your maw for a slide-gorge and getting a single errant Cheeto lodged somewhere in your overalls, or ski suit, or tight Modular tee, or whatever: It's sort of annoying but also sort of Aryan-trash James Bond to keep it hidden somewhere in your getup, undetectable via naked eyes. Debut full-length Beams committed the casual sin of many an electro-pop album-- it contained four hits and a bunch of filler tracks only distinguishable from fellow whoom-whoom-whoomers such as, say, Boys Noize by a giddy Reagan-era gloss. The singles-- and their remixes-- created enough goodwill, though, that one didn't wholly disdain the Presets for surrounding the hits with all that parsley-house. (I'd go as far as to say that each iteration of ""Down Down Down"" is a calf-cramping, forelock-swinging, sweat-drinking banger.) This sophomore release, despite its titular breach of the moratorium on dreary, been-done apocalypse puns, is laudable for pretty much sustaining every cut's levels of quality, such as they are. Once again, vocalizer Julian Hamilton plays impressionist. Mostly gone now, though, are his ribald takes on PiL's John Lydon, Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, and Matthew Dear. Apocalypso features blasé (and certainly intentional?) apings of the Faint's Todd Baechle/Fink, the B-52s' Fred Schneider, and Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder. The effect is: sass aplenty, as each song's verses are sneered with macho Billy Idol bombast, only to go high/falsetto on the chorus, and then refrain like the Cult's Ian Astbury moonlighting as a motivational speaker for real estate agents. Kim Moyes' programmed keys are hardly solely responsible for Apocalypso's being so much aural potpourri atop the toilets of dance clubs hosting 80s nights: You get dabs of swooning Moz, booty-rap-caliber lyrics about girls hungry for ""T-bone,"" triumphant elemental clichés straight outta Bon Jovi, and even hair metal's preoccupation with sterile priapic imagery and prowlerism (check the metal masks and crystal boners making up the artwork of this disc and recent singles). Even their embrace of being labeled ""gaybe"" seems to quaintly hearken back to my childhood of watching painted dudes with teased hair and lacy outfits all bothered on MTV. Hamilton and Moyes' mutual derivativity eventually suggests hybrids of hybrids, like Klaxon Killers meets Duran Justice. Everything here goofily struts and snarkily pulses, and its crassness is the only tonal ""advance"" on display since, well, the proliferation of electroclash compilations at the dawn of this decade. ""My People"" and ""Talk Like That"" are the most punishing (in a good way) numbers, while the boring ""Together"" is apparently a study of how bpms affect sleep rhythms. ""Eucalyptus"" is the oddest effort, as it careens from threatening vamp to Erasure smooshiness-- interesting but ultimately abortive. So this album is a seminar on how to score exactly par in this genre: Simplistic overdriven synth riffs, drained drum-machinery, a rockist 'tude, intense vacillations from ""flowing"" to ""jilted,"" blurry buildups to stark breakdowns, choruses unmeant to penetrate conscious consciousness, sirens, laser sounds, consistent privileging of urbanity, etc. (""This Boy's In Love"" is particularly rich, in that the romance doesn't get belted about as passionately as its context: ""Under the city lights!"") That even the ""human"" ""analog"" vox are constantly looped and stretched doesn't help give Apocalypso the antiseptic, Kubrickian-soundstage feel attained by the best digitalia. The fun herein notwithstanding, as you listen, try to not to place an eBay bid on a Fantom Fogger, think about how unvogue it was when Trans Am re-did this stuff before everybody else (and got called Loverboy loyalists), and tag these tunes in your playlists as (At Least It's) Not the Bravery, or maybe just Huuuge In Sydney.","Simplistic overdriven synth riffs, drained drum-machinery, a rockist 'tude, intense vacillations from ""flowing"" to ""jilted,"" blurry buildups to stark breakdowns, choruses unmeant to penetrate conscious consciousness, sirens, laser sounds, consistent privileging of urbanity, etc.

Made in Dakar,Orchestra Baobab,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb69eb335119a49eca22/1:1/w_160/775592c9.jpg,2008-06-18 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11595-made-in-dakar/,Unknown,"The music biz being what it is, Orchestra Baobab never quite got their due in the West. They disbanded in the mid-1980s, just as more and more people were growing aware that there was music being released all over the world, some of it-– gasp!-– not even in English. Still, the Senegalese group had it better than most. During their initial run, at least, Orchestra Baobab ruled West African pop, and their impact and influence were such the group eventually reconvened, at last getting the star treatment not just locally but around the globe. Orchestra Baobab's aptly titled 2002 comeback disc, Specialist in All Styles, encapsulated many of the ever-evolving group's strengths, in particular their knack for musical assimilation. Equally informed by Cuban and indigenous African musics, not to mention hybrids like Congolese rumba and Senegal's own pop strain mbalax, the disc found them picking up where they left off. Six years later, Made in Dakar continues the voyage with still more seamless style blending. Of course, nothing here is as crass as, say, rap-metal. Orchestra Baobab's fusion is far more subtle, and always rooted in traditional music. While world music elitists might prefer their sounds obscure, exotic, and mysterious, Orchestra Baobab is so smooth, so deceptively accessible, that for once the liner notes actually significantly enhance the listening experience. We learn that the lead track, ""Pape Ndiaye"", stretches back to 1968, and marked one of the first modern updatings of a traditional griot song. We see that ""Nijaay"" was first performed by Baobab back in 1972; the version here features a cameo from Youssou N'Dour, whose own stardom eventually came to eclipse Baobab. ""Beni Baraale"" is a tribute to Guinea's equally groundbreaking Bembeya Jazz; Guinea guitarist Baba Nabe joins Baobab guitarist Barthélemy Attisso in what amounts to a tip of the hat by way of ethno-musicology. Each song here-- with vocals performed in Wolof, Portuguese Creole, French, and Malinke-- is equally rich in history, testament to one of the few positive outcomes of European occupation as they deftly incorporate soul and salsa, rumba and jazz, reggae and country, an exercise in cross-pollination made all the more impressive by the near invisibility of the threads connecting it all. That's ultimately what makes Orchestra Baobab such a joy: It's dance music, pure and simple, made for others to have a good time, easily appreciated on the basis of its musicianship alone (Attisso is particularly inspired throughout) but becoming more impressive the deeper you dig into what's actually being done.","The legendary Senegalese band's first album in six years, consisting in part of re-recordings of the group's earlier songs, continues its impressive record of seamlessly fusing the traditional and the modern.

Litany of Echoes,James Blackshaw,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb93abf31b7dc7155b09/1:1/w_160/4a751a4c.jpg,2008-06-18 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11915-litany-of-echoes/,Tompkins Square,"It was once easy to think of James Blackshaw as an inheritor of the Takoma tradition, a school of searching acoustic guitar playing pioneered by John Fahey, Robbie Basho, Leo Kottke, and others in the 1960s. But listening to the English guitarist's new album, it's clear it's not that simple. While echoes of those three and some of their contemporaries are still present in Blackshaw's music, these days you can hear just as much Terry Riley and Philip Glass in his work. His synthesis of acoustic experimentalism and minimalism is so complete at this point that it's possible to call it Blackshaw's own style. His evolution as an instrumentalist hasn't so much been one of technique (he arrived quite fully formed in that department) as one of diversification. Blackshaw continually expands his approach, and on Litany of Echoes, his sixth album, he's extended his reach away from the 12-string acoustic guitar to the piano, building the record's bookends, ""Gate of Ivory"" and ""Gate of Horn"", off of thick, relentlessly repetitive piano figures. His approach to the piano, though uncomplicated in terms of musicianship, shares much in common with his approach to the guitar. On the latter, he often uses open tunings that allow him to leave notes ringing while he plays short figures or to take advantage of sympathetic vibrations that add clouds of overtones to his music. On the piano, it's a little more straightforward: Blackshaw puts the sustain pedal to the metal and turns simple chords into sheets of harmony. This produces the same kind of sympathetic overtones, but in a great many more octaves. It's still his guitar playing, however, that thrills the most. On ""Echo And Abyss"", Blackshaw alternates dense passages of fluttering, thick guitar and piano chords with sparse solo acoustic guitar passages. In these instances, he plays simple melodic figures over and over, subtly mutating them. The notes he leaves ringing, particularly when he plays harmonics, create sound for the listener that isn't actually even there-- the beating of two close notes against each other creates the auditory illusion of oscillation, adding a false dimension to the sound that nonetheless enriches it. Blackshaw employs violinist/violist Fran Bury to deepen the texture of some of his extended compositions, but ""Infinite Circle"", the smoothest, most harmonically placid song here (it's sort of New Age-y at times) is the only one where it sounds much like a violin or viola normally does. ""Past Has Not Passed"", the album's most stunning composition, features the strings scraping away at the back of the guitar. Bury sets up a pool of drone for Blackshaw to drop strange, sweeping chords into before settling on a pedal tone and working out the song's primary theme, which he reiterates countless times, carefully controlling his constant dynamic fluctuations. Litany of Echoes gives me the impression that Blackshaw began to feel so thoroughly in control of his craft on last year's brilliant The Cloud of Unknowing LP that he needed some new element to destabilize it. The piano doesn't so much do that as logically extend what he already does with 12 strings into a much larger resonating box. Partly because of broader palette, this album loses some of the magnificence of its predecessor, but it is still a heaping pile of gorgeousness that adds another chapter to a young guitarist's already very impressive and increasingly indefinable oeuvre.","Often considered an inheritor of the Takoma acoustic guitar tradition-- think John Fahey, Robbie Basho, and Leo Kottke-- James Blackshaw's synthesis of acoustic experimentalism and minimalism is so complete at this point that it's possible to call it his own style.

"Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea",Silver Jews,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb94c0084474cd0c28bb/1:1/w_160/99dcd936.jpg,2008-06-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11916-lookout-mountain-lookout-sea/,Drag City,"""In 1984, I was hospitalized for approaching perfection."" As first lines of an album go, this one, the opening shot fired on Silver Jews' 1998 album American Water, is among the greats, up there with Raw Power's ""I'm a street-walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm"" and Straight Outta Compton's ""You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge."" It's an especially great line coming from Silver Jews' David Berman because ""perfection"" as a concept has little place in his universe. In this landscape, flubbed notes exist alongside amazing guitar solos (when Berman's buddy Stephen Malkmus is around, anyway), shirts are untucked, keys are more suggestions than rules, some of the best lyrics in rock history are interspersed with unapologetic groaners (I could kiss the guy who wrote, ""Come to Tennessee/ 'Cause you're the only ten I see"") and characters are often flawed to the point of paralysis. Perfection being what it is for Silver Jews, and Berman being so comfortable with that notion, it's easy for fans to gloss over the rough patches. I have a feeling I'm not alone when I say that on every SJ record-- save American Water, almost-- I still skip around a bit. The nature of Silver Jews allows for inconsistent albums, even though the records appear infrequently. Two or three or four duff tracks on one record is nothing to get worked up about, and they may even add to the ramshackle charm. And so while Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea, the first Silver Jews album in almost three years, has the usual small handful of eh-to-just-OK tracks, it also feels different from prior Silver Jews albums in a way that's hard to put a finger on. Part of it could be the lack of knockout songs. There are no instant entries to the SJ canon, nothing here that knocks you on your ass, not a single ""How did he write that?"" moment. And this problem is there from the beginning, the opening, where SJ have always killed: Where Tanglewood Numbers grabbed us by the throat with ""Punks in the Beerlight"" and The Natural Bridge turned a chair around and sat us down to explain ""How to Rent a Room"", Lookout Mountain opens with the plodding and dull ""What Is Not But Could Be If"". You feel like you just tripped and fell awkwardly into the album. It doesn't help that the production is oddly harsh and distant-sounding; where Berman sounds best clear and uncluttered, so that it seems like he's engaging you in conversation, on this record his voice has a weirdly persistent metallic reverb clinging to it, like he's broadcasting from inside a tin can and you're straining to connect with him. Something about the sound makes him sound a bit uneasy, stiff, and a touch less confident. Busy Nashville producer Mark Nevers handled a chunk of the recording and all the mixing, and the warmth he's been known to give albums by Lambchop, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, and the Clientele is missing here. Berman's bassist and vocalist wife Cassie is, as she was on Tanglewood Numbers, far too high in the mix. There were some weird choices made in the studio. I shouldn't dwell on the production, since this band started out as the lo-ist of the lo-fi, recording white noise-packed songs on answering machines-- and besides, you listen to Silver Jews for words. But an album that finds Berman in a more focused mode lyrically, writing lines that seem to straighten out some of his bent lyrical aesthetic, would do well to come with a more welcoming sound. In any event, there are still good songs with quotable lines here, thankfully, and the tunes throughout are solid. The lengthy, bouncy, Dylan-y ""San Francisco B.C."", in particular, is packed with lyrical nuggets: ""We had sarcastic hair/ We used lude (sic) pseudonyms/ We got a lot of stares on the street back then"" and ""She said, 'You don't make enough to provide for me'/ I said, 'What about the stuff that we-- quote-- believe?'"" are two. (I love how you can picture the fingers in the air setting aside the word ""believe."") If the focus throughout seems to move away from stringing together rich, penetrating images, Berman is still skilled enough with words to make him do what he wants them to. The peppy, rushed ""Aloysius, Bluegrass Drummer"" is a surreal short story, with a title character who is a dishwasher at a restaurant ""Open 'til the end of time"" and who falls for a girl ""all strung-out on hard street fat."" And then the weary countrified lament ""Strange Victory, Strange Defeat""-- which wonders about the ""handsome grandsons in these rockband magazines"" who have supplanted ""the fat ones, the bald and the goateed""-- works pretty well, even if the second half of the song doesn't stick. The closing track, ""We Could Be Looking for the Same Thing""-- a cozy ballad that finds David duetting with Cassie-- strips the lyrical flourishes back almost completely: Lines like ""Where the days turn the weeks into months of the year"" and ""I've been around some and I've seen enough to know/ We could spend happy lives, inside the days of you and me"" could have been written by any number of singer-songwriters. That seems purposeful: Berman seems to have something specific that he wants to get across, and he's OK saying it in what, for him, is a direct way. With both Lookout Mountain and Tanglewood Numbers, there's been discussion about these records being made after Berman's time staring into the abyss, when he survived a suicide attempt, worked through a serious drug problem, got married, started touring, and generally got his shit together. So it's tempting to hear some of the differences with this record-- the tamer imagery, the more even keel, the highs that aren't so high-- as somehow mirroring the changes in Berman's personal life. For me, though-- since I never knew how tough Berman had it while enjoying his records up through Bright Flight, never had a clue as to depths of his suffering, and never heard his music in that context-- it seems wrong to start thinking about such things now. Instead, I prefer to think of Lookout Mountain as an album of pretty-good songs from a guy who has written some unbelievably great ones, and will, more than likely, write some more of that quality down the road. There's never been any kind of definable arc with the Silver Jews, no movement toward a fixed point; it's more about keepin' on keepin' on. Once perfection is off the table, and you're just doing the best you can with what you have, there will be moments like this.","Their first album in three years, the latest from Silver Jews finds songwriter David Berman in a more focused mode, writing lines that seem to straighten out some of his bent lyrical aesthetic.

The Siren's Wave,Nalle,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6c13d197565213b0b5/1:1/w_160/63abbba3.jpg,2008-06-17 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11597-the-sirens-wave/,Locust,"Glasgow trio Nalle strike an interesting balance between traditional folk and experimental drone-- interesting, but not always successful. The group is clearly well-versed in minimalism, and they make thoughtful meditations using a wide range of instruments (the CD notes list more than 20, including harmonium, singing bowl, water, and birds). But their farther-out drones tend to drift into ruts, and their music is more engaging and unpredictable when they mix abstraction with melody. The best example comes in the middle of The Siren's Wave, during two 10-minute tracks that hit the poles of Nalle's sound. ""Voi Ruusuni (O Rose)"" is an elongated tone-poem with some hypnotic elements, especially Hanna Tuulikki's Yoko Ono-like wail. But mostly the track wanders with no clear destination, its sonic range narrow and its energy level unchanging. By contrast, ""Secret of the Seven Sirens"" moves purposefully from idea to idea. The band still rambles loosely, unrestricted by set patterns, but a little structure makes them more focused. It also frees Tuulikki and partners Chris Hladowski and Aby Vulliamy to try sounds that ""Voi Ruusuni""'s monolithic drone can't accommodate. The rest of The Siren's Wave divides along similar lines. The gentle ""Alice's Ladder"" and the ethereal ""Young Light"" both entice with small melodies, but the morose ""First Eden Sank to Grief"" (Nalle aren't exactly comedians) sags into monotony. There are exceptions: the drone of opener ""Nothing Gold Can Stay'' mesmerizes due to Tuulikki's responsive voice, which sounds more like a string instrument than human breath. Tuulikki, who wrote most of these songs, smartly makes her singing the album's spine. Evoking Joanna Newsom, Björk, and Finnish avant-folker Lau Nau, she can sometimes get a bit too mannered, but she is admirably unafraid of any vocal sound, as childlike or atonal as it may be. Even when Nalle meanders, you can hear strands of many influences in their loose concoctions, from La Monte Young to Tower Recordings to White Magic. This bodes well for the group's future-- as they hone in on what parts of their sound work best, the various traditions their music is steeped in should provide the staying power that The Siren's Wave might ultimately lack.","Glasgow trio Nalle strike an interesting balance between traditional folk and experimental drone, making thoughtful meditations by using a wide range of instruments (the CD notes list more than 20, including harmonium, singing bowl, water, and birds).

All We Could Do Was Sing,Port O'Brien,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb60eb335119a49eca11/1:1/w_160/33dbe8e4.jpg,2008-06-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11588-all-we-could-do-was-sing/,self-released,"Are the manifold manifestations of twee the most fearsome boogieman facing rock music? Did you frame that Sasha Frere-Jones article where he complained about indie not being black enough? Ever consider buying a Decemberists concert ticket just for chance to get a clean shot at Colin Meloy? You should probably just stop reading right now. Odds are, this very site is reviewing four other records that you'll almost certainly like more than this one. Okay, are they gone yet? Great. Admittedly, the old-salt seafarer archetype may as well be the paleface dope boy at this point in terms of tired ubiquity, and All We Could Do Was Sing is built on the very things that tend to keep the rhythm bandits at bay: massed choruses, prop pieces, nautical terminology, female bandmembers. The good news is that the band's official debut (following the 2007 collection Wind And The Swell) is still a solid art-pop album at its core, and importantly, more American Gangster than The Crane Wife-- i.e., though anchored by a central narrative and supported by enough real life experience to tell the tale, Port O'Brien weaves its way in and out of the story whenever it's convenient. Which I suppose would make the heaving, power-chorded scene dismissal ""Pigeonhold"" Port O'Brien's ""Ignorant Shit""-- an album highlight of playful venom that couldn't have less to do with the actual concept, which wraps up with the scratchy Exxon barb ""Valdez"" (""There's no way they can repay the sea/ There's about two million ways you could repay me""). It's a lyrical deception that carries throughout, particularly on ""Fisherman's Son"", which, despite being something an autobiographical retelling of cannery work in Alaska, is actually more of a country mouse/city mouse examination of the universal burden of living up to or breaking free of familial expectations. Likewise, the slowly rising string drama of ""Stuck on a Boat"" could just as easily be an allegory transferable to titles like ""Stuck in a Cubicle"". While those two in particular manage to retain a rickety, unkempt charm, Port O'Brien come perilously close to running aground on obvious influences. ""Don't Take My Advice"", cop of Modest Mouse's ""Perfect Disguise"" and all, is one of the more lethargic odes to wandering eyes you'll ever hear, dragging ass too heavily to really chase it, and ""In Vino Veritas"" finds Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Otherside"" ambling on a horse with no name. Of course, if you want to paint these guys as another teetering collective gassed off Arcade Fire fumes, overlong interlude ""The Rooftop Song"" serves up a softball c&w approximation of ""Wake Up"" for your convenience. But Port O'Brien know how to win skeptics over, a good trait to have when you're touring with sonically similar bands like Rogue Wave. This album is bookended by the most propulsive tracks-- ""Close The Lid"" does a wide-eyed scamper through its deceptively roomy five-minutes, latching on to a ragged guitar hook amidst the torrent. But if they don't appeal to you in the first four minutes, odds are they won't at all-- ""I Woke Up Today"" is a mission statement and a summation, a sticky acoustic motif over relentless drums, the group singing in chorus the whole time, echoing the main theme of its title by rhyming it with ""in a very simple way."" Turns out Port O'Brien take to the sea for the same reasons many do-- either as an escape or a search for some sort of cosmic truth.","Oakland, Calif., art-pop outfit returns with a full-length of nautically-themed songs; while there is an overriding narrative supported by enough real life experience to tell the tale, the band is smart enough to weave its way in and out of the story whenever it's convenient.

African Scream Contest: Raw & Psychedelic Sounds From Benin & Togo 70s,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b66113d197565213ae01/1:1/w_160/52e96c92.jpg,2008-06-17 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11566-african-scream-contest-raw-psychedelic-sounds-from-benin-togo-70s/,Analog Africa,"If you're a fan of classic music from the African continent, you're living in rich times. Interest in the music outside of the communities it was made in is at an all-time high, and there is a new crop of intrepid reissue labels willing to put in enormous amounts of time and energy to bring this music to a whole new set of waiting ears. These are not the fly-by-night exploito outfits of old-- Popular African Music, Sound Way, Analog Africa, the newly resurrected Strut, and Graeme Counsel's recent series of African music projects on Stern's/Syllart do it the right way, tracking down the original masters when available, finding the artists, and making sure they get paid. Analog Africa's Samy Ben Redjeb already had loads of cred for the way he handled his two previous releases, which featured Zimbabwe's Hallelujah Chicken Run Band and Green Arrows, respectively. He traveled to Zimbabwe and spent time with the creators, digging deep into their stories and emerging with great-sounding, informative compilations that thoroughly introduced the listener to both the music and the musicians. African Scream Contest moves a few thousand miles northwest to Benin and Togo, two chimney-shaped former French colonies (Togo was a German colony until WWI) squeezed between West Africa's Anglophone giants, Ghana and Nigeria. These are small countries, usually overshadowed by their neighbors in international affairs but nonetheless culturally and musically rich, and both have experienced the numbingly common ailments of former European colonies to varying degrees. Most of Francophone Africa fell heavily under the sway of Congolese rumba in the 1960s and 70s, or developed heavily Cubanized forms of their own-- Senegal, Guinea, and Mali in particular developed their own sounds parallel to rumba. Benin and Togo were certainly not exempt from rumba's charms, but they were also caught in the highlife crossfire between Ghana and Nigeria, and the funk and soul sounds imported in massive quantities to those countries in the 60s and 70s inevitably found their way across the borders. There's even a case to be made that Afrobeat developed just as much in Cotonou, Benin, as it did in Lagos, Nigeria. Ignace de Souza & His Melody Aces were pulling in rock elements as early as 1962, and there's plenty of funk in his work with the Black Santiagos-- if you can find a copy, Original Music's long out-of-print Ignace de Souza compilation, the Great Unknowns, Vol. 1, is wall-to-wall brilliant. Benin had an amazing surfeit of excellent bands by the early 70s, and Redjeb tracked down many members, a touch-and-go process he describes vividly in the liners, which function as both educational piece and travelogue. The kings of the Cotonou scene were Orchestre Poly-Rythmo (there are innumerable variations on their name; the most complete is Tout Puissant Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou Dahomey). Though Redjeb makes an admirable attempt to offer as much variety as possible, Poly-Rythmo still shows up three times, once on its own and twice as a backing band. The band recorded in all kinds of styles-- check Popular African Music's Reminiscin' in Tempo disc for their highlife sound, and Sound Way's Kings of Benin Urban Groove for their funk side-- but these three all feature a particularly wicked high-speed groove that they were the first to perfect. Their ""Gbeti Madjro"" is stunningly funky, with a few head-spinning passages where the band strips back to just guitar, bass and drums as if to say ""even at our most skeletal, we are twice as powerful as anyone else."" The quality of the recordings is excellent, and the remastering brings out the depth in each one, but the character of the sound is about as raw funk gets. Togo's Roger Damawuzan (sometimes spelled Damahouzon) has all the screaming charisma of early-70s James Brown, and his ""Wait for Me"" balances his gruff vocal with a cool, mellow guitar riff and burbling bass. The horns and guitar sound utterly Memphis, but the cracking drums are all West Africa. His countrymen, Napo de Mi Amor et Ses Black Devil's, turn in a burning, organ-led Afrobeat tune that recalls the style of some of their Ghanaian colleagues. Back in Benin, Orchestre Super Jheevs des Paillotes come closest to matching Poly-Rythmo's breakneck Afrofunk groove on the amazing ""Ye Nan Lon An"", which swivels around an Afrobeat backbeat with a breathtaking guitar part that earns pride of place ahead of the vocals in the mix and makes that upside-down engineering decision sound completely logical. It's counterintuitive moves like this that make African funk such a constant joy to discover, and there are plenty more on this disc. But beyond that, there's just a uniqueness to these musicians' take on funk and Afrobeat that's magnetic. Dig the garage rock organ flipping out over the funk beat of El Rego et Ses Commandos' ""Se Na Min"". Try not to dance to Picoby Band d'Abomey's outrageously raw and rhythmic ""Mi Ma Kpe Dji"". If you're into funky African music you won't be able to resist them. African Scream Contest easily joins the ranks of the most essential African funk compilations, partly by covering ground no one else has walked on, but mostly just for relentlessly kicking ass for over an hour. This is some of the best funk ever recorded anywhere, and it ranges from quick blasts of hyperspeed groove like Le Super Borgou de Parakou's ""Congolaise Benin Ye"" to the ruminative Fela-style Afrobeat of Vincent Ahehehinnou and Les Volcans' spicy Afro-Cuban workout. Whether you've been hunting down El Rego 45s on eBay for years or just heard and loved your first Fela reissue, this disc is emphatically for you.","New set from the Analog Africa reissue label joins the ranks of the most essential African funk compilations, partly by covering ground no one else has walked on, but mostly just for relentlessly kicking ass for over an hour.

The Supreme Genius of King Khan and the Shrines,King Khan and the Shrines,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb88abf31b7dc7155af2/1:1/w_160/93a68f30.jpg,2008-06-17 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11620-the-supreme-genius-of-king-khan-and-the-shrines/,Vice,"The fantastical tale of King ""Bama Lama"" Khan begins in 1995, when the Montreal-born son of immigrants from India (and self-professed grandson of the opium-addicted ""Johnny Thunders of the sitar"") left home to play bass for the Spaceshits, a Cramps-linked garage-rock group fronted by Mark Sultan, aka future King Khan partner BBQ Show. A few years later, while in Germany Khan formed ""psychedelic soul big band"" the Sensational Shrines. By 2004, King Khan and the Shrines had played shows across Europe, along the way releasing not just a handful of 7"" and 10"" records, but also two full-length albums: 2001's Three Hairs & You're Mine, which was produced by White Stripes engineer Liam Watson, and 2004's Mr. Supernatural. Most people didn't hear about King Khan and the Shrines until last year, when What Is?!, their most recent LP for German label Hazelwood, seared the band's combustible combo-- Stax plus Nuggets plus hiss-covered indie-rock screwiness-- onto listeners' collective noggins. It was as if they were the Dirtbombs on simultaneous James Brown and Sun Ra kicks, or Black Lips with less of the Vice-ready comedy and more underlying pathos. Now signed to Vice, King Khan and the Shrines present a few of the best tracks from What Is?!, along with some of their earlier cuts, on label debut The Supreme Genius of King Khan and the Shrines. Despite the appropriately over-the-top title, it's not so much a Greatest Hits-- What Is?! has slightly better songs overall-- as a chronicle of how Khan became King. The strongest tracks, where the band's unhinged nostalgia meets not only squealing discord but also Khan's stupefying jester/soul-man antics, appeared previously on What Is?!. Take nourishment from the Hammond-drenched soul food-stamps of ""Welfare Bread"". Hear Khan go howling mad and a step past girl-crazy amid the sitar-like guitar and wah-wah pedals of ""I Wanna Be a Girl"". The string-tying absurdity of ""69 Faces of Love"", or the prickly dick jokes and ""Venus in Furs"" string drone of ""The Ballad of Lady Godiva"" are sadly absent, but the deafness-repping James Brown of ""Land of the Freak"", the Stooge-ian assault of ""No Regrets"", and the relatively sane red-line retro of ""Outta Harm's Way"" are all present and accounted for, as they should be. The seeds for that sound were sown long ago, as the older tracks on The Supreme Genius of show. The record opens where it oughta-- at a record store-- with the masochistic ""Torture"", originally from a 2000 7"". The ""she's fat, she's ugly"" chorus of 2001 10"" cut ""Took My Lady to Dinner"" loses its novelty sooner than some of the band's later ideas, and yet every time Khan sings about bringing home the bacon (or his special lady's Empire State-sized ass), well I just break down and laugh; queasy ballad ""Fool Like Me"", from the 2001 debut LP, finds similar redemption. ""Sweet Tooth"", off a 2004 split LP with the Dirtbombs, has the party ambiance of What's Going On, but it, like a few of the tracks on the second half of the album, shows a group not quite fully formed, lacking the self-awareness and depth of their best work. ""My heart is broke and I feel alone,"" Khan intones on 2003's ""Que Lindo Sueno"". Even at their worst, they're merely retro. It probably bodes well for King Khan and the Shrines that their best days aren't already, uh, years behind them.

At Mount Zoomer,Wolf Parade,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb84ea9e61561daa7268/1:1/w_160/b10fe42f.jpg,2008-06-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11616-at-mount-zoomer/,Sub Pop,"Any proper insomniac can recite the consequences of a few frantic, sheet-twisting nights: lethargy gives way to elation, reason falters, your teeth start to throb, and a vague sense of uneasiness gradually mutates into weird, wild-eyed paranoia. Wolf Parade doesn't seem like a band that routinely logs its eight hours: Apologies to the Queen Mary, the group's 2005 debut, was riddled with allusions to sleeplessness, and its follow-up, At Mount Zoomer, is no less restless-- it's a fraught, expansive ode to being way too awake. ""We're tired,"" vocalist/guitarist Dan Boeckner admits, voice defeated. ""We can't sleep."" While prepping At Mount Zoomer for release, the band reportedly promised Sub Pop ""no singles,"" which-- no matter how attached you are to the notion of the LP as a singular document-- seems like a self-defeating vow. Paradoxically, for a statement of cohesion (take these tracks together, or don't take them at all), At Mount Zoomer is inherently disjointed, very much the product of two distinct, if exceptional, songwriters. Unluckily for Wolf Parade, the success of Boeckner and co-frontman Spencer Krug's side ventures (Handsome Furs and Sunset Rubdown, respectively) means their stylistic tics are now public information, and, as effectively as these dudes co-exist onstage, they're still singular creative forces. The band's resolve to enlarge and intensify itself-- At Mount Zoomer seems focused on skewing darker, on sounding nastier, more perilous, and less straightforward than its predecessor, with elaborate arrangements and, you know, no singles-- translates into a lot of proggy diddling (and, ironically, less theremin). The approach yields predictably mottled results: At Mount Zoomer is both captivating (""Call It a Ritual"", ""Language City"", ""California Dreamer"") and a little bit exhausting. Recorded in Petite Église, the Quebec church owned by Arcade Fire, and produced by drummer Arlen Thompson, At Mount Zoomer is free from the influence of Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock, who produced the bulk of Apologies. Lyrically, familiar themes abound: multiple allusions to funerals, cities, dreams, empty rooms, and things that mean nothing. Wolf Parade are uniquely skilled at skewering contemporary (see also: urban, digital, accelerated) culture, and these songs relay a sense of being stuck in the wrong spot at the wrong time-- it's a tense, tenuous place to live. ""Soldier's Grin"" opens with punchy keyboard and guitar, before Boeckner steps up to outline the scene: ""In my head, there's a city at night,"" he sings, voice clear and desperate. Although the song's objectively optimistic, full of twittering synths and mewling guitars, it's also deeply anxious, and when Boeckner promises ""what you know can only mean one thing"" it seems pretty evident that that one thing's no good. ""Call It a Ritual"" is equally uneasy; Krug's quiet, opaque vocals are spectral and strange-- less piercing than Boeckner's, but way more atmospheric-- and the track descends into a dreamy, muddled haze that feels a little bit like sleepwalking. ""California Dreamer"", another Krug-penned cut, is epic in scope: Although it's only six minutes long, it's relentlessly squirmy, flitting from quiet, guitar-driven dirge to full-band throwdown. Whereas Apologies to the Queen Mary closed with an unimpeachable tract of songs, from ""Shine a Light"" on, At Mount Zoomer fizzles and sags after its sixth track-- the record's grueling backend culminates with the contentious, 11-minute ""Kissing the Beehive"", a stubbornly unmelodic finale marked by a mush of throbbing guitars and histrionic vocals (ironically, it's the only track that Krug and Boeckner co-wrote). At Mount Zoomer is fractured and spastic, and at times, the band's ambition eclipses its strengths. Still, there's something about Wolf Parade's fragility that's profoundly relatable, and the sense that the entire operation could fall apart at any second-- that we're all tottering on the brink of total dissolution-- is as thrilling as it terrifying.","The two distinct, exceptional songwriters in Wolf Parade-- Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug-- combine to create a record that seems focused on skewing darker, on sounding nastier, more perilous, and less straightforward than its predecessor, 2005's Apologies to the Queen Mary.

Body Language,Monotonix,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6685e6ef95969322925/1:1/w_160/1805c0b9.jpg,2008-06-16 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11573-body-language/,Drag City,"If there were ever a band that had trouble living up to its live show on record, it'd be Monotonix. While you can get the gist of their concert experience from breathless online reports and YouTube clips, suffice to say, if you don't want to be covered in more than a few bodily fluids, lift musicians and their equipment in the air with your hands as they play, see flames leap from cymbals (an old trick that's still pretty dangerous), and stare into the hoary pockmarked face of rock'n'roll itself, then whatever you do, don't go see Monotonix live. So when it comes to their records, short of the CD spitting on you the moment you crack open the case, it's gonna fall short. That said, the band's debut EP is an inspired slab of no-frills, no-nonsense guitar rock that stands in the shadow of vintage metal while stretching out for a few genuine surprises. For a band that names one of its songs ""No Metal"", Body Language sure has its share of palm-muted and bottom-heavy riffs, charmingly over-the-top vocals, and even ominous, maniacal laughter on ""Deadly Weapon"". Metal is definitely part of the record's appeal-- most especially for those singeing opening notes of ""Summers and Autumns""-- but that's not where it ends. Monotonix certainly nods to a few hip hard-rock influences, from Sabbath to ZZ Top to maybe even a little early Iron Maiden, but there's more to it than that. They're far more fluid than most two-man guitar/drums lineups, as guitarist Yonatan Gat slides in and out of solos without ever throwing the rhythm off the rails. There's serious synergy between him and drummer Ran Shimoni as the latter underlines every whim of the guitar on ""Summers and Autumns"" while and anchoring every stop-on-dime turn, and maintains this grasp from the sleek and relatively straightforward riffery of ""Deadly Weapon"" to the go-nuttery guitar of ""No Metal"". ""Body Language"" has the most headbanging rhythm and conspicuous guitar licks on the EP, but it also throws in a cascading piano riff over the song's tricky turnaround that goes a long way to color the track, and keeps the record itself from getting too homogeneous. The descending guitar line that follows is sweet and yearning enough to fit onto a damn Strokes record; It's a hell of a hodgepodge that makes its four minutes seem epic, and it all flows seamlessly. Singer Ami Shalev navigates every turn with an exaggerated croon that can taunt, plead, and terrify as the situation demands. The EP stands up as a whole, but it's these kids of details that bode well for future releases that could do more than lure listeners to the band's stage show. As it is, this is a promising start.","Tel Aviv-based hard rockers with an over-the-top live show debut on record with an EP on Drag City.

How We Lost,Windsor for the Derby,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb57ea9e61561daa71fe/1:1/w_160/c37e91a7.jpg,2008-06-16 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11579-how-we-lost/,Secretly Canadian,"Over their last few albums, Windsor for the Derby have traveled steadily further from their roots in 1990s post-rock and into the realm of melodic indie pop. Vocals went from being little smears in the mix to fully-formed, coherent carriers of melody and understandable lyrics, rhythms lost some of their krautrockiness, and they generally became a better band. As of their eighth LP, the band's always-fluctuating membership stands at five, with Jason McNeely and Dan Matz in the lead, as always. They haven't totally abandoned their old post-rocking ways-- they're still as much about sound as they are about songs, and some of this record's inconsistency stems from relapses into meandering soundscapes, albeit mostly brief ones. Little ambient doodles like the mostly inert ""Robin Robinette"" and the disheveled-sounding ""Troubles"", which features guitar playing totally out of rhythm along with barely discernible mumble-singing, just don't fit anymore amidst cranking, memorable rock songs such as ""Maladies"" or ""Fallen Off the Earth"". The first two thirds of the album are mostly filled with crisp songs. Opener ""Let Go"" rises from a placid tone pool into a moody, minimal number with floating, doubled vocals, fluttering organ figures, and a nice, clean guitar part-- it's supremely uncluttered and bodes well for the rest of the album. ""Maladies"" largely delivers on the promise with its thumping beat, good guitar riffs, and fantastic wordless chorus. ""Hold On"" and ""Fallen Off the Earth"" flow in a similar vein, falling back a bit more on the band's familiar motorik-derived sense of rhythm, while the nicely understated guitar-and-voice track ""Forgotten"" features possibly Windsor's best lyrics to date, with simple ruminations on being remembered and growing old. Then there's the matter of the album's final third, which takes a headfirst dive into grainy shoegazer territory with little in the way of warning. Though ""What We Want"" is actually quite good, subsuming the noisy guitars in favor of organ and harmony vocals, it stills feels disjointed next to what comes before, and the other two closing songs aren't as memorable. Indeed, after years of indecision as to what kind of band they wanted to be, Windsor for the Derby seem to have finally opted against ever deciding. And that's really not a bad thing-- while it's not a masterpiece or terribly cohesive, How We Lost still manages to pack a lot of interesting and even excellent music into its 36 minutes.","While it continues their steady drift from post-rock to melodic indie pop, Windsor for the Derby's eighth full-length is still diverse enough to suggest that they never want to be any one kind of band.

Young Team [Deluxe Edition],Mogwai,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb70ea9e61561daa723a/1:1/w_160/6146ac11.jpg,2008-06-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11600-young-team-deluxe-edition/,Chemikal Underground,"The current decline of the music industry is of course not so much a catastrophic collapse as a simple market correction: a delayed downturn that should've actually begun in the early 1980s, before major labels cajoled consumers into replacing their vinyl collections with shiny CD replications-- thereby artificially padding their bottom lines well into the 90s. But now that record companies have lost control of the means of production, it's funny to see the indie-rock industry resorting to the same behaviour: Making people buy the same albums over and over again, lavishing the reissue treatment not just onto era-defining classics (e.g., Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe and Deluxe set), but also on albums that were simply very good. Just this spring alone we're being treated to 15th-anniversary editions of Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville, the Lemonheads' It's a Shame About Ray, and Sebadoh's Bubble and Scrape-- albums that were certainly much admired and analyzed in their 1993 inception, but which in 2008, don't really resonate far beyond nostalgic completists. By that yardstick, Scottish post-rock perennials Mogwai are jumping the gun somewhat, reissuing their debut full-length album, Young Team, in an expanded double-disc edition barely a decade after it first appeared, and given that they've released a steady stream of mildly variable albums since then, it's not as if we've had much of a chance to miss them. But in this particular case, the reissue serves more of a practical than a canonical function-- the label that released Young Team in the U.S. in 1997, Jetset, went kaput several years ago, making what is still the band's most cohesive and consistently bracing album the hardest to find on these shores. But the timing is all the more appropriate given that Mogwai's most recent release, 2006's Mr. Beast, was their most perfunctory set of quiet/LOUD instru-metal to date, so it's an opportune time to revisit the album that made us care in the first place. And the fact that Young Team's influence can still be felt across the international indie-sphere-- not just in kindred art-rock spirits like Sigur Rós and Explosions in the Sky, but also avant-metal outfits like Boris and Pelican-- means the album exists today as something more vibrant than a museum piece. For a mostly instrumental band, Mogwai have developed a reputation in the media for being big mouths who take no small delight in slagging other bands (hey guys, how about a 10th-anniversary reissue of those ""blur: are shite"" t-shirts?) and praising themselves. However, the spoken-word intro-- a friend reading out a gushing student-paper review of an early Mogwai performance-- that ushers in the slow-burn rapture of Young Team's ""Yes! I Am Long Way From Home"" feels less like a cheeky self-aggrandizing device than a rejection of the hollow Britpop hyperbole that was endemic to the era. But if Mogwai were determined to distance themselves from prevailing retro-rock fashions, Young Team evinced a nostalgic streak of its own, particularly for the pre-Britpop moment of 1988-91, when indie rock bands both American (Slint, Mercury Rev) and British (My Bloody Valentine, Bark Psychosis) were obliterating the parameters of rock music (and the VU meters that quantify them), before those groups either dissolved or turned more classic rock. So in a sense, Young Team was tending to unfinished business, bridging the continuum the connects shoegaze psychedelia to the anti-pop aesthetic and rhythmic thrust of the then-emergent post-rock. But, of course, what distinguished Mogwai from the multitude of all-instrumental outfits jockeying for a Thrill Jockey deal was that their post-rock actually rocked. And to this day, nothing in their catalogue attests to this fact more than Young Team's startling second track, ""Like Herod"". Even when you heard it the first time, you knew the song's silently stalking momentum-- guided by Dominic Aitchison's deceptively melodic bassline-- would trigger an eruption of heavy-metal thunder that sounded like Slint soundtracking the shower scene in Psycho. But the tension lies not in question of whether the bomb is going to drop, but when, and this re-mastered reissue does a superb job of prolonging that feeling of impending doom-- during the song's second quiet stretch, you can hear Stuart Braithwaite and John Cummings' fretboard taps panning back and forth in the mix, like an unseen predator taunting you from some unseen location in the shadows before going in for a particularly savage kill. And after 11 years, I'm still never quite prepared for it. At 11 minutes, ""Like Herod"" is actually only Young Team's second longest song; that honour belongs to 16-minute closer ""Mogwai Fear Satan"". Rather than resorting to sudden dynamic shifts, Young Team's colossal closer masterfully layers sheets of distortion, percussion and flute swirls over a repeated, ascending three-chord progression that-- despite the cacophony swarming around it-- projects a remarkable sense of calm. These two titanic tracks-- still staples of the band's live set-- have traditionally overshadowed the rest of Young Team's tracklist; listening to the album in its entirety today, what strikes you most is not so much Mogwai's brute force, but that these erstwhile piss-takers are capable of moments of great beauty and sensitivity: On the glockenspiel-gilded ballad ""Tracy"", random phone conversations are threaded into the mix, casting the mundane chit-chat in a overwhelmingly melancholic light, rendering the track as a requiem for someone who's no longer with us; on ""R U Still In 2 It""-- Young Team's lone vocal track-- guest singer Aidan Moffatt of Arab Strap duets with Braithwaite on a devastating anti-love song that vividly captures a dead-end relationship being strung along by declarations of non-commital commitment. Given how prolific Mogwai were in their formative years, much of what would normally be considered for anniversary-edition extras was already released 10 years ago, in the form of the Ten Rapid singles collection, the 4 Satin and No Education = No Future (Fuck the Curfew) EPs and the Kicking a Dead Pig remix collection. So all that this reissue's second ""Appendix"" disc can offer is one unreleased track (the suitably mournful ""Young Face Gone Wrong""), a couple of compilation rarities, and a hearty serving of Young Team concert/radio-session recordings. The band's faithful version of Spacemen 3's ""Honey"" (taken from a 1998 tribute album) provides insight into Mogwai's more melodic influences, and seven-inch obscurity ""I Can't Remember"" finds the band toying around with a DJ Shadow-esque drum loop, but the live tracks mostly stick to the script-- the one revelation being that, in concert, Mogwai seem to be in more of a hurry to plow through ""Like Herod"" and ""Mogwai Fear Satan"", lopping several minutes off of each. Still, the version of ""Satan"" that closes this collection-- taken from Chemikal Underground's fifth anniversary party in 2000-- does add one sound effect that the original Young Team version merely implied: the sound of ecstatic applause confirming minds well blown.",,9.2,
Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends,Coldplay,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb89abf31b7dc7155af6/1:1/w_160/eb613a95.jpg,2008-06-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11621-viva-la-vida-or-death-and-all-his-friends/,Capitol,"Earlier this year, Britons voted Coldplay as The Band Most Likely to Put You to Sleep. The poll, conducted by hotel chain Travelodge, had Chris Martin & Co. beating out aural Ambien including James Blunt and Norah Jones. Even for a band known to take solace in their overarching pleasantness, the drowsy coronation doubled as a harsh insult. After all, Coldplay is a rock band. A grandma-friendly, Radiohead-normalizing, disarmingly polite rock band led by a man who sounds like he's still yearning for puberty perhaps...but a rock band nonetheless. After proving their stadium bona fides with 2002's bristling A Rush of Blood to the Head, these wuss messiahs fattened up with X&Y, a startlingly bland affair that even forced eternally level-headed New York Times critic Jon Pareles to dub them ""the most insufferable band of the decade."" The Travelodge survey indicated this considerate foursome wasn't even keeping people awake long enough to piss them off anymore. So Coldplay did what any U2 acolytes worth a chiming guitar chord would do-- they went off to ""rip it up and start again."" But Viva isn't a complete overhaul á la Achtung Baby or Kid A; just as they dull the sharp corners of their legendary influences musically, Coldplay offer a diluted version of the ""experimental"" mid-career maneuver with their fourth LP. It's a case of well-honed troubleshooting that should keep the faithful conscious enough to appreciate its subtle improvements. Ever self-deprecating, Martin offered his band's thesis to MTV a couple weeks ago: ""We look at what other people are doing and try and steal all the good bits,"" he said. ""We steal from so many different places that hopefully it becomes untraceable."" That last bit is probably wishful thinking. For their ""new direction"" album, Coldplay hired the egghead responsible for more new direction albums than any other producer over the past 35 years, Brian Eno. The move isn't original, but it's smart. A self-described ""sculptor"" with a tendency to chip away rather than augment, Eno helps Coldplay reverse their bloat in favor of a slimmer sound; the anthems remain but they're no longer bogged down by incessant refrains and overdubs. Thanks to a bubbling bit of exotic percussion that wouldn't sound out of place on Peter Gabriel's latter-day LPs, ""Lost!"" is transformed from Just Another Coldplay Song into a uniquely alluring smash and live staple for years to come. The Gabriel connection is also apparent on the spectacular, wide-eyed ""Strawberry Swing"", which floats light tribal drums above circular guitars and Martin's idyllic musings. Think ""In Your Eyes"": The Next Generation. More welcomed semi-surprises: Ballsy first single ""Violet Hill"" pulls off some honest-to-God Scary Monsters mutant funk while ""Chinese Sleep Chant"" is a shoegaze excursion as traceable as it is passable. Arcade Fire producer Markus Dravs' touch can be heard on the strung-out anthem ""Viva la Vida"", its ""woah oh oh!"" refrain already responsible for untold iPod sales. Apart from a few brief lulls into somnolent twinkle-pop, the music is purposeful, svelte, and modern. If only Martin could inject some pathos into his often-embarrassing universal scripture. There's a thin line between lyrics that speak to everyone and lyrics that suck-up to everyone (see: Bono's steady devolution over the last couple decades). Even on Coldplay's best songs, Martin sometimes has trouble reconciling his inner hack with his better judgment. On Viva, he backs away from the wallowing self-pity that tanked X&Y, instead going for black-and-white extremes-- life and death, love and lust, dreams and reality-- with little regard for any shades of gray. His supposedly ominous headstone obsession on ""Cemeteries of London"" is about as creepy as a midday graveyard stroll. And ""Lost!"" is nearly done in by a cringeworthy verse featuring big fish and a small pond. But there are moments when Martin's band mates push his wide-open words toward more specific meaning. Blissful nostalgia permeates ""Strawberry Swing"" so thoroughly it's impossible to deny its ""perfect day,"" and the hook to Viva's closer relishes its immortal rush: ""I don’t want to follow death and all of his friends!"" He may be a pointed critic of his own broadness-- as seen in his guest appearance on ""Extras"" and in countless humble interviews-- but Martin is still a hopeless sap. He's clearly aware of Thom Yorke's apocalyptic verve and Bono's most cunning reflexive confessionals, but thus far he's incapable of matching either one. ""Lights will guide you home/ And ignite your bones/ And I will try to fix you,"" sang Martin on X&Y's ""Fix You"", a gag-inducing bit of motivational flotsam that came off like self-parody. Viva offers a more believable fix to the current Coldplay dilemma, i.e., how does a pop band with artful aspirations please everyone while satisfying themselves at the same time? Because while they ape their forebears without mercy, there's no mistaking a Coldplay song from a U2 or Radiohead song. The new album expands their individuality in tiny, effective ways while maintaining their world-beating gifts. The record's violent, revolution-themed artwork is misleading. Viva is more like a bloodless coup-- shrewd and inconspicuous in its progressive impulses.","In a case of well-honed troubleshooting after the startlingly bland X&Y, Coldplay's fourth LP is a diluted version of U2's Achtung Baby or Radiohead's Kid A, the ""experimental"" mid-career maneuvers of their peers.

A Place Where We Could Go / Airwalker EP,Jeremy Jay,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb78c0084474cd0c2878/1:1/w_160/177ba17b.jpg,2008-06-16 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11692-a-place-where-we-could-go-airwalker-ep/,K,"Jeremy Jay grew up in Los Angeles speaking exclusively French. If his idea of the cinematic differs from the glacial landscapes of Sigur Rós, or the widescreen orchestration of Eluvium, blame it on Jean-Luc Godard. The lo-fi pop singer/songwriter's releases evoke an urban boulevard of yet-unbroken dreams, starting with 2005 debut 7"" ""This City Tonight"" and continuing through last year's piano-synth instrumental Dreamland soundtrack LP. Like Peter Pan or a left-coast Jonathan Richman, Jay takes us to his imagined worlds on the Airwalker EP, released late last year, and first proper full-length A Place Where We Could Go. Both are bathed in reverb the way film noir is in shadow. The Airwalker EP, then, is a cryptic, compelling short. As with Jay's ""We Were There"" 7"", released about the same time, the EP tucks Jay's half-crooned, half-spoken vocals into a bed of interlocking guitars, rigid beats, and analogue synths, creating an air of mystery out of disconnected images. Where the 40-second intro is a dubbier variation on the title track, doing little more than establish Jay's predisposition toward intros, ""Airwalker"" itself finds Jay singing beneath his usual voice, his reflecting intonations sounding like Ian Curtis, though there's a knowing artiness in the chuckles emanating from the right side of the speakers. ""What's in the air when you're walking on air?/ Where can we go when the lights are low?"" Jay repeats. More about images than meanings, it's the opening shot that draws the audience in. The rest of the EP presages A Place Where We Could Go's stark lullabies more clearly, even as it fails to achieve the title track's magic. Piano features amid the Morrissey-esque wordless murmuring of finale ""Can We Disappear?"", with its lyrics about shadows, and on the bass-driven ""We Stay Here (In Our Secret World)"", in which a ""secret"" boy and ""secret"" girl ""talk of secret things"" while driving down the boulevard past street lamps. ""Lunar Camel"" has the EP's most intricate guitar riff as well as its most explicit reference to pre-rock music (""Fly me to the moon""). The reverb-swept tambourine and guitar jangle of 1980s indie's 60s nostalgia accompanies what could be set directions on ""Angels on the Balcony"", with its talk of afterglows, open doors, phantom cigarettes, silent cries, and ""the kids,"" always the kids. A Place Where We Could Go, produced with great understatement by K founder and former Beat Happening frontman Calvin Johnson, is Jay's feature film. At slightly less than 29 minutes, it's a slight one, reminiscent of an era before 78-minute CDs-- and on it, Jay fittingly ditches the synths, playing guitars and pianos while Chris Sutton (of Olympia, Wash., groups C.O.C.O. and the Johnson-led Dub Narcotic Sound System) adds loose, simple drumming that varies in intensity as the songs dictate. From a six-second opener with Jay sighing ""night, night"" to a bare, piano-driven finale asserting that ""Someone Cares"", Jay's debut plays out like a Buddy Holly- and yé-yé-informed soundtrack to a night of wistful dreams that eventually (sort of?) come true. If there are hints of Bowie in there, it might just be a mutual admiration for British actor, singer, and songwriter Anthony Newley (""Pure Imagination"", ""Goldfinger""). The simple arrangements, like Jay's spoken-sung vocals, recall the solo work of Jonathan Richman, who has also bridged the pre-rock era with a punk sensibility, the Stop & Shop with the lesbian bar. Jay's songs are best when the images they're centered around have, like 50s icons James Dean or Marilyn Monroe, a certain dream-like hyper-reality: the youthful title character of the fuzzed-out ""Beautiful Rebel"", the mysterious figures of slow doo-wop waltz ""The Living Dolls"", or the narrator dreaming ""of a story to tell/ While you lay there in soft white sheets"" on ""Escape to Aspen"". The first full-length track, night-night-bidding ""Heavenly Creatures"", pictures a face with ""porcelain skin, ruby-red lips, dark blond hair, fairy tale look."" The slightly plodding, flamenco-flavored ""Till We Meet Again"" has its bike ride at midnight, and the title track borrows the lamppost from the Airwalker EP. None of this is as overly precious as it might sound-- Jay emphasizes mood over cleverness-- but the drowsy pacing and sentimental leanings won't be for everybody. Jay's voice takes on a higher tone on ""While the City Sleeps"", over snapped fingers and one of the album's fleeting bass lines, as he compares a dream-walk with a lover to, what else, a movie. The shambling ""Hold Me in Your Arms Tonite"" remakes the bed into a place for making love-- ""true love,"" as obvious as it is necessary to the album's narrative arc (such as it is). On bonus track ""Oh, Bright Young Things"", Jay murmurs, ""The other day my dreams and life seemed like one/ In my dreams I know how to fly."" A Place Where We Could Go probably wouldn't make much of a film, but it's a mostly picturesque escape.","L.A. singer-songwriter brings a left-coast Jonathan Richman sensibility to these Buddy Holly- and yé-yé-informed K Records releases.

Go Out Tonight,Paul Haig,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b65eb1335d7bf169aa4f/1:1/w_160/11689420.jpg,2008-06-13 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11564-go-out-tonight/,Rhythm of Life,"There are cult acts cool to so many they hardly qualify as cult, and then there are cult acts cool to so few they barely show up as a blip on the radar. It's in this latter category that you'd likely find Paul Haig, not that the former Josef K leader has been doing much about it. Like fellow Scottish post-punk stalwarts Orange Juice, Josef K burned bright but briefly, and unlike former Orange Juice frontman Edwyn Collins, Haig has had a mostly overlooked solo career-- much of it spent shifting his attention from strummy guitars to slick dance pop. But frustrated that his commercial aspirations never quite bore fruit, Haig more or less fell from view, his erratic back catalog in and out of print save for Josef K's brilliant output. Don't call it a comeback, but, well, the Paul Haig some know and love has returned. A recent Scottish show marked Haig's first live set in almost 20 years, and by all accounts the music leaned heavy on the guitar. Not that Go Out Tonight is any less of a dance record than some of its predecessors, but it takes only a few seconds into opener ""Trouble Maker"" before Haig's trademark angular and funky guitar shards enter the fray. If the music sounds more like mid-period New Order or even late-era Wire than prime Josef K, Haig at least seems interested in re-engaging with his roots. Songs like ""Stay Mine"" and the closing gem ""Gone in a Moment"" are equally indebted to early 1980s UK indie, though the bulk of Go Out Tonight is more amorphous in its meeting of synth-pop and rock. It's in this in-between place where you'll find tender ballads like ""Believe"", buoyed by acoustic guitar and some old school programming or the more propulsive rave-ups ""Shut Down"" and ""Data Retro"". Then again, it's hard to tell if the likes of ""Hippy Dippy Pharmaceutically Trippy"" is terrible or tolerable, and ""Fantasize"" and ""Acidic Snowdrop"" both feel at least a couple of decades of dance music off. Indeed, as pop goes, Go Out Tonight teeters on the edge of piffle, and rarely comes close to brilliant. Still, you can't begrudge Haig's belated if ultimately half-hearted attempts to seize the spotlights.

Flight of the Knife,Bryan Scary,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b66513d197565213ae0b/1:1/w_160/95218ebb.jpg,2008-06-13 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11570-flight-of-the-knife/,Black and Greene,"As far as puns on rock icons named Brian go, Bryan Scary is as appropriate an appellation for its glam-boyant eponymous frontman as the Brian Jonestown Massacre is for that band's brand of sinister psychedelia. But
the kind of scary that Bryan deals in is of a decidedly Rocky Horror variety: His second album, Flight of the Knife, sucks in all kinds of 1970s-- the canonic glitter-rock of Sparks and Queen, the MOR pop of Wings and ELO, and the fleet-fingered prog of Yes and early Genesis-- but its crafty construction betrays a staunch determination to make a whole decade of once-guilty pleasures feel innocent all over again. Ironically, one definitive 70s rock act that Bryan Scary doesn't immediately bring to mind is Roxy Music-- in contrast to his namesake Ferry's debonair cool, Bryan Scary projects a gentle, childlike presence that seems forever on the verge of being overpowered by the time-signature trickery and noodly arpeggios swirling around him. But like Bob Pollard and Carl Newman before him, Scary understands that prog-rock is really just psychedelic pop with the between-song gaps removed-- and if you want people to buy into your crazy cosmic concepts, you better make sure they have something to sing along to first. The end game is not so much prog as power-pop with chops. That Flight of the Knife's title track is broken up into two book-end tracks-- the first, a rhapsodic overture complete with jazz-funk interludes, the latter a rollicking, boogie-woogie-- implies some sort of overarching storyline (in short: the sky is high and space is the place), and the ecstatic energy with which Scary prances through character pieces like the celestial ""Venus Ambassador"" and the giddy, piano-pounded freak-out ""Imitation of the Sky"" suggests he’s already fantasizing about a crossover theatrical adaptation. But it'll be one narrative logic takes a back seat to spectacle: in just four minutes, ""The Purple Rocket"" alternates between head-bopping power-pop and jarring prog-jazz breaks, before settling on a ""ba ba da ba ba” group chorus that sounds like a jingle for a kids' cereal commercial-- for no apparent reason other than it can. Scary's aggressively eager showmanship and ADD-addled arrangements threaten to exhaust himself and his audience equally-- by the time we hit the plasticine pop of ""Son of Stab"", the song's whip-lashed change-ups feel more the product of indecision than ingenuity. So the penultimate piano ballad ""Heaven on a Bird"" feels all the more triumphant for its McCartneyian modesty: ""It's such a fantasy,"" Scary admits of the titular travel plan, but if heaven is out of the question, he'll at least settle for Broadway.","Bryan Scary's second album sucks in all kinds of 1970s rock-- the canonic glitter-rock of Sparks and Queen, the MOR pop of Wings and ELO, and the fleet-fingered prog of Yes and early Genesis.

Single Collection 1972-1980,Richard Pinhas,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b66cea9e61561daa6f82/1:1/w_160/ac8ae805.jpg,2008-06-13 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11577-single-collection-1972-1980/,Captain Trip,"French rock and pop, when not being dismissed outright, are often discussed only in terms of English-language antecedents. Johnny Hallyday brings to mind Elvis, for example, and the chameleonic, hedonistic Serge Gainsbourg is sometimes compared to David Bowie-- the latter despite being a predecessor. Even in the French experimental and electronic communities, this tendency has reduced France's historical context. Magma is often filed away from its country in the auspices of the krautrock section, Parisian synth-punk groups like Metal Urbain are often viewed as a dark answer to-- you guessed it-- punk, and progressive and electronic composers like Richard Pinhas languish in the shadows of Manuel Göttsching, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler. But Pinhas, whose Single Collection 1972-1980 has recently been issued by Japan's Captain Trip label, has left just as long a legacy as any of his German contemporaries. This CD compiles a number of Pinhas's early 7"" singles, all released before the de facto beginning of his solo career, the 1980 masterpiece Iceland. Even at his best, Pinhas also isn't above being directly influenced by his forebears. Alongside his solo work, the disc also chronicles Pinhas's work in the witty blues-based psych-rock outfit Schizo, as well as his Berlin School-influenced sequencer work with Heldon and his further experimentations in that scene as THX. Pinhas exhibited a fluidity that moved in the flowing undercurrent of technology in the mid-1970s, adopting the Moog and later sequencer sounds of his contemporaries with a decidedly direct approach to melody. These singles show Pinhas never shying away from synthesized or guitar-based leads at the outset, spurning the patient, sometimes half-hour long approaches adopted by Schulze and others in the Berlin camp. Even ""Baader-Meinhof Blues"", an eight-minute Heldon tune that owes a lot to Tangerine Dream's Rubycon and Phaedra, wastes little time in developing a bass synthesizer progression, and then an oblique distorted guitar lead. Pinhas' solo work is some of the most arresting on the compilation. ""West Side"", one of the few vocal pieces outside of the Schizo singles, strikingly combines his dense electronic pulse with the anthemic noise of the emerging new wave. ""Beautiful May"" also hints at his increasing use of melodic synthesizers such as those on Brian Eno's Another Green World and his future use of tape-delayed guitar, a la Robert Fripp. Unfortunately, the Fripp & Eno comparison might be the most troubling of all that can be drawn with Richard Pinhas, especially considering that his later works like 1996's De l'Un et du Multiple (also recently re-issued on Captain Trip) rely on delay systems similar to Frippertronics. But as both that record and Single show, Pinhas composes with the intent of translating the sometimes obscure lexicon of technology with the wit and honesty he's carried since his absurdist Schizo days. Maybe the best defense for Pinhas-- hell, for all alleged French imitators-- is not that he took from those who came before him, it's that he took what came before him and made some damned sense out of it.","French experimental electronic performer shows tinges of progressive rock, new age, and no wave on this compilation from the Captain Trip label, which includes solo work as well as singles from his seminal group Heldon.

Seeing Sounds,N.E.R.D.,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb7d13d197565213b0d3/1:1/w_160/e3d539e3.jpg,2008-06-13 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11610-seeing-sounds/,Interscope,"Rockist habits die hard-- if you don't believe me, go to the nearest used CD store and spin a N.E.R.D. album. Trust me, they'll be there. While the Neptunes' space-age synths and bucket percussion spawned literally dozens of pop hits over the past decade, even as contemporaries like Timbaland and Kanye West were becoming muso darlings, these Tidewater gadflies were mostly denied any sort of serious credibility until they got critics back into their comfort zone by hitching their sound to Hulk Smash palm-mute riffs and live drums. At which point everyone went kinda overboard, as Brent DiCrescenzo put it in a review of 2004's Fly or Die, ""limit[ing] their vocabulary to the Hall of Fame"" while lauding some of the weakest material Pharrell Williams, Chad Hugo, and Shay ever came up with. At least In Search Of... had enough juice to be called uneven, but the musical priorities of Fly or Die were so out of whack, only the most determined contrarian could possibly still be listening to it. Needless to say, all those breathless ""future of music"" plaudits were probably anticipating a more profound result of N.E.R.D.'s influence in 2008 than kids in tight pants learning how to pull a fakie ollie. So yeah, the bar's been set far lower for Seeing Sounds, which by default makes it a more satisfying experience-- it can even be backhandedly complimented as a comeback of sorts by mere virtue of not being noticeably worse than what came before it. But the continuing problem of N.E.R.D. is that it's nearly impossible to figure out how much you should invest in them, or really how much they're invested in it-- as the group's public voice, Pharrell has never shied away from claims of helming some sort of polyglot musical mastermind, and free of their commercial burdens, N.E.R.D. should ostensibly document their unfettered genius. And then they release songs that chop it up with Good Charlotte, compare female asses to spaceships, and on lead single ""Everybody Nose (All the Girls Standing in the Line for the Bathroom)"", P lampoons partygoing cokeheads by sounding like Baha Men after five too many rails. If you're looking to soundtrack scenes of ""Real World: Hollywood"" housemates dry-fucking each other at Geisha House (""jump around like you're ADHD! ADHD!"" goes ""Anti-Matter""), Seeing Sounds might be worthy of regular rotation, but for the rest of us, it's just another baffling, obnoxious mess of ""serious fun"" from a squad whose glory days are getting harder to remember. It almost feels silly pointing out how brazenly they're wielding Occam's Razor here: Were Seeing Sounds just a collection of hooks or beats, it might not be half bad. I can't imagine too many people in Starboard P's Rolodex turning down the sass mouthed chorus of ""Anti-Matter"" or the gleaming harmonies of ""Sooner or Later"", but neither disparages the idea of actual songwriting being far down the list of what N.E.R.D. is actually good at. The former gets marooned from the rest of the song as they go into a rampage fueled by equal parts Red Bull and Roni Size, and as for the latter, it's ironic that P swipes the piano part from ""Changes"", since they repeat themselves so often over the span of nearly seven minutes of nebulous breakup malaise that you'll wonder if you got a faulty leak. Like its unexpected stylistic kin My Morning Jacket's Evil Urges, Seeing Sounds finds its creators partaking in the subversively phallocentric narcissism of staring at their CD collections, confusing music listening with music understanding rather than enjoyment. At first blush, ""Windows"" nicely jerry-rigs an octave-toggling surf riff to some eerily Sting-ish backing vocals, but get past that surface pleasure and you're treated to Pharrell's typically priapic lyrics, rhyming the title with ""she's a 10, yo,"" among other things (mostly ""yo""). ""Happy"" is N.E.R.D.'s shoegaze moment (no, really), albeit with a complete misunderstanding of the production dynamics-- despite all those flanger sound effects, it's about as immersive as a thimble and could just as easily be coming out of a Sega Genesis. And then there's ""Kill Joy"", which along with Lil' Wayne's ""Mrs. Officer"", augurs a scary possibility that rappers are starting to rediscover deep cuts from Blood Sugar Sex Magik. At the very least, some will feel better knowing that Pharrell and Chad are apparently speaking again, even if playing 52 pickup with genre is becoming the only fun of N.E.R.D. albums as opposed to considering every track a battle to see whether P first gets bored of his lyrics or his melodies; it's a tough call on ""Yeah You"", four minutes of quiet storm drizzle about being stalked via e-mail. But in an odd way, Seeing Sounds is a liberating listen-- clearly, N.E.R.D. are beholden to no one but themselves and a kind ear can at least enjoy the almost Zen-like nothingness of the Black Card Era: all withdrawal, no deposit.","The new album from the Neptunes' rock project can be backhandedly complimented as a comeback of sorts by mere virtue of not being noticeably worse than what came before it.

U.S. Singles Collection: The Capitol Years (1962-1965),The Beach Boys,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb74c0084474cd0c286f/1:1/w_160/aae60437.jpg,2008-06-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11603-us-singles-collection-the-capitol-years-1962-1965/,Capitol,"There's a historical marker on Interstate 105 in Hawthorne, California, in about the same spot that the Wilsons' childhood home once stood. That's Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, who shared a bedroom into their teens and went on, with their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine (replaced for a time by David Marks), to form a band that's still cemented in the American consciousness 50 years later. Brian Wilson was the driving creative force in the band, taking his love of Chuck Berry, doo-wop and Phil Spector's widescreen L.A. pop sound, adding a large helping of his brother Dennis's surfing hobby and California car culture, and creating a sound all his own. The evolution of that sound is on full display across the 16 discs of Capitol's new U.S. Singles Collection: The Capitol Years, which covers the group's 45 output from 1962 to mid-1965, oddly stopping in the middle of that year without including ""She's Not the Little Girl I Once Knew"" and ""Barbara Ann"". The box is available digitally, but the real draw for fans will be the limited-edition boxed set, which includes a book, 15 singles ,and one ""bonus single,"" each on its own disc with a reproduction sleeve, plus 32 bonus tracks distributed across the set and mostly consisting of alternate stereo mixes. It's a lavish treatment-- definitely not carbon-neutral, but it does have the effect of turning back the clock a bit to a time when listeners had to engage more closely with records, physically changing the disc when the song was over. Brian was 19 when the band formed in 1961 (as the Pendeltones) and just beginning to flex the songwriting and arranging muscles he'd developed in his childhood from watching his father Murray play piano and taking music classes in high school. Though a newly minted adult, he and his band set about building a musical monument to early 60s teen culture that had an odd resonance across the U.S. in spite of its focus on surfing and hot rods, which were very specific to California at the time. It was the soundtrack to the sort of endless summer that a kid in Minnesota or Connecticut could only dream of, and it was packed with enough detail to paint a vivid picture for record-buying kids who had never seen an ocean. This set understandably doesn't include the band's debut single, ""Surfin'"", which was released on the independent X label in late 1961 and managed to hit #75. Instead, it begins with their major label debut, ""Surfin Safari"", backed with ""409"". It was a perfect kick-off, with the band's trademark harmonies setting up both of the band's early obsessions, surfing and fast cars. It's hardly a masterpiece, but the A-side is infectious and creates a perfect mental image of guys in trunks running across the sand with their boards, beach-attired girls behind them. If you grew up in the 60s or around oldies radio in the decades that followed, you undoubtedly have ""Fun, Fun, Fun, ""Little Deuce Coupe"", ""I Get Around"", ""Shut Down"", and ""Surfin' USA"" memorized, but in a lot of ways these songs don't even tell half the story. Even at the very beginning, you can hear Brian Wilson's creative restlessness shining through. The band's second Capitol single, ""Ten Little Indians"" b/w ""County Fair"", is certifiably awful on both sides, but ""County Fair"" makes interesting use of bullhorn-wielding carnies in its arrangement and offers an early hint at some of the uncertainty that would ultimately bubble up through Wilson's work as the girl he goes to the fair with leaves him with another guy, calling him a loser in the process. The early slow songs show an amazingly mature compositional sense. ""Surfer Girl"", with a melody inspired by ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", is a wonderful waltz-time ballad that gives us a spine-tingling early taste of Mike Love's ability to handle slow songs with rich emotion. The song is full of pie-in-the-sky promises and self-conscious reality checks-the protagonist tentatively asks his love interest, ""Do you love me?"" ""In My Room"" leaves behind the surf and exhaust for quiet introspection-- it's hard to imagine a single teenager anywhere in America not being able to identify with wanting a space of one's own in which to brood over the day's drama. The psychological dichotomy of the Beach Boys-- and more specifically Brian Wilson-- is most prominently on display on that 45: ""In My Room"" is the B-side of ""Be True to Your School"", a boastful account of athletic prowess and school spirit that also features an imaginative arrangement complete with cheerleaders. The backing tracks are handled by crack L.A. session players, whose skill gave Wilson wide latitude in his arrangements. Capitol includes an instrumental backing track for ""I Get Around"" a few discs later that is just astounding in its precision and complexity. That song's B-side, ""Don't Worry Baby"", was Wilson's attempt to capture the feel of the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"", his favorite song. Led by his own falsetto vocal, what he wound up with has a different feel, but its sophistication and sweeping melody place it on par with its inspiration nonetheless. By this point it was the middle of 1964 and the band was headed inexorably away from its roots and toward something more enduring and powerful. ""She Knows Me Too Well"" is a heartbreaking and exquisitely arranged song that has Love sifting through his relationship with his girlfriend and essentially finding that while he loves her, he's also a jerk who can't stop himself from hurting her with his roving eye. ""The Warmth of the Sun"" is another tremendous slow song, borrowing its slow 6/8 sway from some of the best doo-wop of the 50s but pointing the way toward Brian Wilson's most ambitious work. In 1964, he was already experimenting with hand percussion, harps, tympanis and other ways to augment the band's sound, but it was at the end of the year, when he quit touring with the band following a nervous breakdown, that Wilson truly became free to expand on his ideas as he wanted to. He'd felt pressure from the British Invasion to innovate for over a year, and it's hard to argue against what he came up with. B-sides ""Please Let Me Wonder"" and ""Kiss Me, Baby"", neither of which charted, are both pretty enough to raise the hair on the back of your neck, but both were lost on the flip sides of mega-hits, the latter attached to ""Help Me Rhonda,"" the band's second #1. These discs chart an amazingly steady build-up to the final single they catalog, ""California Girls"" b/w ""Let Him Run Wild"". Though there will always be debate as to the worth of the A-side's lyrics, the music, a stately stomp that sets jaunty organ to dissonant horns, swinging bass and multiple tambourines, is undeniable. In July of 1965, it was a Technicolor re-affirmation of the endless summer, but don't forget the B-side. ""Let Him Run Wild"" is nearly as good and a clear sonic blueprint for Pet Sounds. This box is an interesting look at the warts-and-all development of America's Band, though I hesitate to call it essential for anyone but the band's most dedicated and invested fans. Apart from a live version of ""409"" recorded in Chicago after Brian Wilson had stopped touring, all eight previously unreleased tracks are alternate mixes, so there are no major revelations. To that end, it's more the object that commands the price, and it is a very attractive object. For the more casual listener, though, there are plenty of other ways to obtain these singles.","This set of early Beach Boys songs (some now almost 50 years old) is available digitally, but the real draw for fans will be the limited-edition boxed set, which includes a book, 15 singles, and one ""bonus single,"" each on its own disc with a reproduction sleeve, plus 32 bonus tracks distributed across the set and mostly consisting of alternate stereo mixes.

Let's Be Friends,Mixel Pixel,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b669ea9e61561daa6f7a/1:1/w_160/25a64442.jpg,2008-06-12 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11574-lets-be-friends/,Mental Monkey,"It was only a matter of time before Brooklyn-based trio Mixel Pixel gave into the techie connotations of their name and did away with their psychedelic, willfully cheap guitar sound. After all, though 2005's Contact Kid was wracked with twee Beat Happening aspirations, their 2006 follow-up was, if not better produced, at least more sweeping in scope. Taking their arch, druggy songs to the dancefloor on Music for Plants, they seemed to find their footing with minor-key new wave flourishes and electronic textures, embracing their more computerized impulses so as to match the winking artificiality of their droll, acid-friend lyrics. But now, on their fifth effort, they seem to have given up on the guitar altogether. Well, maybe not altogether-- Rob Corradetti's axe does turn up on most of the 11 tracks on Let's Be Friends, but it always sounds like an afterthought buried in the mix below videogame bleeps and bloops. His guitar melodies either sound like lackadaisical throwaways, as if he is simply noodling absentmindedly under buzzing keyboards, or they are used for brief bursts of feedback and fuzz to aid in the synthesized feel of these wannabe-8-bit songs. It is not coincidence, then, that the album's finest moment is its least electronic. In fact, ""Sinking Feeling"" isn't just this record's best song, but is also, hands-down, the best Mixel Pixel song yet. Its squishy drum machine rhythms add a propulsive heartbeat underneath the guitar's almost-folk vamp, and though Corradetti is singing in unison with Kaia Wong, this song makes wonderful use of the dissonance between his handsome, dusky delivery and her sweet, babyish coo. But ""Sinking Feeling"" aside, most of Let's Be Friends sounds like it was made on a crappy vintage Casio, lazily using the machine’s pre-programmed beats as its foundation. That kind of sparse lap-pop can work, but without catchy vocal hooks to lure listeners in or clever lyrics to keep them attentive, it simply sounds hollow. And sadly, these songs too often feel like excuses for Corradetti and/or Wong to wryly speak-sing hipster shout-outs to their Converse and getting high. When the too-clever or downright silly lyrics are swathed in less barebones synth arrangements, as on the blatant Magnetic Fields homage ""Cats"", they are less grating or noticeable; the listener can just ignore them and enjoy the sticky-candy melody and astral computerized effects. But those moments are few and far between. Perhaps what's missing here is a lyrical innocence to match the amateurish synthesizer melodies. After all, if the words were as faux-naïve as the music (or artwork) here suggests, maybe it would read as an overall aesthetic choice, instead of a musical limitation. Mixel Pixel are right to wade in electro textures, but, right now, they aren't quite comfortable enough yet to submerge themselves, so this synth-heavy collection finds them, unfortunately, a little out of their depth.","On their fifth album, Brooklyn-based trio Mixel Pixel have finally, fully given into the techie connotations of their name and mostly done away with their psychedelic, willfully cheap guitar sound.

After Hours,D. Charles Speer and the Helix,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b662c0084474cd0c25a3/1:1/w_160/5d1fc81c.jpg,2008-06-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11567-after-hours/,Black Dirt,"After Hours rolls in, alt-country flags flying: opener ""Fossilized"" boasts some two-chord strum and pick, a rutted-road rhythm, honky-tonk ivories, even the thick thud of cowbell. And in his lugubrious baritone, Dave Shuford-- the man behind the D. Charles Speer curtain-- lays out a litany of boilerplate woes: broken relationship, stalled career, the general suckiness of growing older and an inch closer to feeling obsolete. From a six-Buds-to-the-wind perspective, he tells a woman who used to come to his shows but doesn't anymore: ""These days I see you'd rather be set on fire/ Than to be a part of the attending choir/ But I don't really mind"". These genre markers, however, are posted on what turns out to be a garden path. Two verses in, guitars whinny, drums stumble, and amps froth at the mouth, as ""Fossilized"" spasms seizure-style, and Shuford and backing band the Helix collectively lose their shit in a brief psychedelic breakdown. Limning the country/psych membrane isn't a particularly novel strategy, of course. From the cross-pollinating Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and adjacent artistic circles of the 1960s and 70s, to the cowpunk and psychobilly scenes of the 80s and 90s, to today's robust indie-country landscape, the curious crossroads of backwoods and inner eye always seems to draw its share of pilgrims. Many of the hybrid's recent strains-- gothic Americana, in particular-- offer willfully weird, self-conscious genre-bending performances that verge on camp. But on their second record after 2007's more folk-identified Some Forgotten Country, Speer and the Helix take a page from the past and play it straight up. Kind of. After Hours' bounty of drinking songs for down-and-outers-- ""Drink Up and Go Home"", the title track, and the band's cover of Gary Stewart's desolate ""Single Again""-- proclaims its genuine, irony-free affection for twang and scant patience for artifice. When damp creeps through After Hours' floorboards and stuff on the walls slips askew, they come off as reasonably organic developments. The droning-veering-into-abstract ""Sit Right There"" imagines the Greek bouzoukis as a historically accurate fixture of the Appalachian folk tradition. ""Canaanite Builder"" is convincingly fire-and-brimstone, as Shuford drawls jumbled Old Testament verse and draws vivid grotesquerie (shrunken heads, severed feet) to menacing, heavy-bottomed grooves. ""Past or Beyond"" is a schizophrenic style parade of whiplashed time signature shifts that hints at band members' avant-garde backstories in taxonomizing-resistant acts No Neck Blues Band and Sunburned Hand of the Man. But even when it shares more with No Wave than No Depression, After Hours makes you think that maybe the odd stuff was buried in the ancient songs all along. And here's where the ""old, weird America"" is typically invoked. Nine times out of 10, the phrase Greil Marcus made famous is utterly inapplicable. However, D. Charles Speer's hidden-in-plain-sight aesthetic, its facility for making the familiar strange (and deserving of closer scrutiny) is exactly what Marcus was on about when he pointed in wonder at ""the mystical body of the republic, a kind of public secret...a declaration of a weird but clearly recognizable America within the America of the exercise of institutional majoritarian power."" So shine a light, lift a rock: this weird secret deserves to be known.","Although it sometimes shares more with No Wave than No Depression, Dave Shuford-- the man behind the D. Charles Speer curtain-- most often speaks from a six-Buds-to-the-wind perspective.

Parallel Play,Sloan,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8013d197565213b0d7/1:1/w_160/84161b01.jpg,2008-06-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11612-parallel-play/,Yep Roc,"Sloan never really fell off, but they've often been taken for granted. You know how it goes with American critics-- make a bunch of classicist pop comparisons, wonder why they aren't as big in the U.S. as they are in Canada, slap three stars on it, move on to something with more cachet and see you in two years. Which leads me to believe that the surprisingly muted reception of 2006's Never Hear the End of It was the result of no one really knowing what to do with it. Clocking in at 30-tracks with a suite-like flow (more like an avalanche), the record didn't reprogram the parameters of Sloan's sound so much as their scope-- this sort of ambition played completely against type, and were it the work of a younger band, there's a good chance, well, you'd never hear the end of it. Which puts Parallel Play in a strange position of being a follow-up to a breakthrough album that never really broke through. At least that's what one might think judging from its decidedly more restrained 13-track, 37-minute dimensions. But Parallel Play isn't a reaction to the excess of Never Hear the End of It so much as a consolidation of its strengths. As before, each song careens into each other with nary a second in between, which can distract from the real reason this feels so consistent-- Sloan continue to sound more like a band than four distinct songwriters, a set-up which has arguably led to some accusing them of lacking distinction. Having taken their Beatles fixations to a logical extreme, they find a parallel play in Belle & Sebastian's The Life Pursuit, co-opting glammier beats to service their fussy, handcrafted pop-rock without succumbing to a loosey goosey sexuality that would be a poor fit. Even those accustomed to Sloan's effortlessness will find the first half of Parallel Play almost flawless. There's still little in the way of artifice or innovation, but it's still easy to admire the architecture-- while the hammering shuffle of ""Believe in Me"" builds to an ecstatic, positive chorus, it careens right into ""Cheap Champagne"", which reverses course by downplaying the clever minor progression in hooks in favor of the ""ba ba's"" that start it off. But beyond those two, Sloan never feel the need to come on too strong, as ""All I Am Is All You're Not"" gets its hands muddy before striking oil on the hook and ""Witch's Wand"" disguises its subtly dark lyrics about female mind control (or possibly heroin, but I doubt it) behind the head-bopping melodies. But then again, there's an issue here that's not really Sloan's fault, per se-- as with most bands who traffic in this sort of retro-minded AM fixation, they always have to skirt the temptation of being too academic. No band should get docked points for making things sound too easy, but when they try to stretch out into a more psychedelic format with the uneasy melody of ""The Dogs"" and wiggly wah-wah on ""The Other Side"", things drag on quite a bit-- these are songs Kula Shaker could probably write in their sleep. Which isn't true of the mission statement of ""Down in the Basement"", a surprisingly personal (and Dylan-aping) retelling of what matters most to Sloan at this point-- staring down their forties, but unfortunately reprised with a cloying, generic lyric on ""I'm Not a Kid Anymore"". Simultaneously evidencing hope, doubt, and perseverity, it's an endearing mission statement, and with power-pop generally falling into the clutches of edgeless pantywaists like Fountains of Wayne, it's refreshing to hear one of its finest practitioners see it as a cause worth fighting for.","The latest from veteran power-poppers Sloan, Parallel Play, is in a strange position of being a follow-up to a breakthrough album-- 2006's ambitious Never Hear the End of It-- that never really broke through.

The fact was evident at this year's Summer Jam, when he spent two and a half interminable minutes noodling and crooning all by his lonesome while a stadium full of New York's most devout hip-hop fans looked on bewildered. ""Is he really playing the guitar right now?"" giggled a teenage girl. ""That's not a chord or anything!"" Still, she recorded Wayne in all his tatted-up Tracy Chapman glory for YouTube posterity just the same. While everyone else on the day's bill-- from Alicia Keys to Kanye West-- filled their shortened, festival-style sets with hits and finely-tailored theatrics, the audience's most anticipated act took the opportunity get his Guitar for Dummies on; Lil Wayne is, as he likes to say, ""different."" Always has been. Earmarked as a gifted elementary school student in New Orleans, he became the token prodigy of his hometown's Cash Money clique at the age of 16, spitting pipsqueak gangsterisms over skittering Mannie Fresh beats. And, opposed to the typical rap flame-out trajectory, Wayne got better-- and stranger-- with each album. Now, nine years after his first solo LP, and on the heels of an unprecedented glut of increasingly remarkable mixtape and internet leaks, we get Tha Carter III, the epic culmination of a lifetime of eccentricities. This is Wayne's moment and he embraces it on his own terms. Instead of hiding his bootleg-bred quirks in anticipation of the big-budget spotlight, he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions into a commercially gratifying package that's as weird as it wants to be; he eventually finds his guitar but keeps the strumming in check. ""I pay my dues, you keep the difference."" As the major music industry continues to wheeze and splinter, Lil Wayne's spitball marketing plan for C3 is an unprecedented masterstroke. Over the past couple of years, he's given away more worthwhile free music online than most artists of his stature ever release officially. Using the mixtape market as a free-for-all training ground, Wayne expanded his persona, voice, and talent while presumptively killing off thousands of wannabe MCs hoping to charge five bucks for some garbage CD-R. For that alone, he deserves thanks. Wayne set the definition for a Web 2.0 MC-- his output pours through computer speakers at broadband speeds. And while stellar tapes like Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3 offered-up plenty of hidden darts for sun-deprived message board nerds, his Just Say Yes policy toward any and all guest invitations (Enrique Iglesias? Why not!) provided maximum visibility and chiseled his radio-friendly chops. Piggybacking on hits by Chris Brown and Lloyd undoubtedly did wonders for his giggling teenage girl fan base, but a lesser-known assist appears to have had an even bigger effect on the new record. ""Gotta work everyday/ Gotta not be cliché/ Gotta stand out like Andre 3K."" One of the few satisfying tracks on OutKast's bungled Idlewild album was a woozy bitchfest called ""Hollywood Divorce"" featuring Lil Wayne. In hindsight, the invite feels like an act of sanctification. The song's a lesson in winning idiosyncrasies-- Andre, Big Boi, and Wayne are all salty, but they make sure to side-step pessimism (Big Boi deems rumor mongers ""M&M's with no nuts""). Traces of the South's most genre-bursting, P-Funk-worshipping ATLiens can be heard all over C3, from Wayne's staccato phrasing on ""Mr. Carter"" to the extraterrestrial fetishism of ""Phone Home"" to the eclectic unpredictability of it all. The musical open-mindedness also lifts C3 above regional niches-- the #1 hit ""Lollipop"" sounds more like it was born on Jupiter than anywhere on earth. While Wayne isn't quite ready to produce something like ""Hey Ya!"", don't be shocked if you see him held up by a pair of leprechaun suspenders in the not-so-distant future. ""I've done it before, please don't make me do it no more."" C3 is Wayne's most absurd album to date but it's also his most personal. ""Shoot Me Down"", with its ""Lose Yourself""-style guitar chug and ominous hook, has the rapper looking all the way back to age 12, when he accidentally shot himself with a .44 Magnum while toying with the gun in a mirror. ""Two more inches I'd have been in that casket/ According to the doctor I could've died in traffic,"" he rhymes on ""3 Peat"", possibly referring to the day in 2001 when a disgruntled groupie shot at his tour bus, planting a bullet in his chest. Such details add even more gravitas to his grizzled, elastic timbre, which suggests an impossibly hoarse (and high) David Ruffin at times. ""All I ask is don't take our love for granted,"" sings a perfectly sympathetic Babyface alongside Wayne on the lush ballad ""Comfortable"", the line coming off more like a saucer-eyed plea than a threat. And the LP's best track doubles as its most crazed and pained. ""Playing With Fire"" is a full-on faux-metal stunner that hearkens back to Bad Boy's cinematic peak. On it, Wayne reaches Ghostface levels of paranoid distress: ""I'm doin' the same shit Martin Luther King did/ Checkin' in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch/ Same balcony like assassinate me, bitch!"" His claims of MLK grandeur are far-fetched, but his impassioned delivery makes them seem more believable than one would think possible. Apparently, those Biggie and Pac references are getting to his codeine-addled brain-- after all, at 25, Wayne is now older than both legends were when they were gunned down. The implicit danger of carrying on such a legacy only adds to the rapper's dramatic reading, and his anguish burns as hot as his punchlines. ""I think everybody gonna like this one...I got one!"" Considering his running-faucet leak rate, there are bound to be fanboy quibbles about the intricacies of C3's tracklist (e.g., the buoyant web gem ""La La La"" should replace ""La La"" and its braindead Busta Rhymes verse, and what about the hazy ""I Feel Like Dying"" or the promising speed-soul track ""3 a.m.""?). But considering there are probably several hard drives stuffed with syrupy odes featuring Wayne's dubious auto-tuned howl, the final tally is exquisitely balanced and considered. After dozens of listens, the record's overflowing minutiae-- from Fabulous and Juelz Santana's overachieving cameos to Wayne's hilariously apropos kinship with ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage-- still feels limitless. Just as the record's cover playfully skews the Ready to Die/Illmatic baby-picture formula with Photoshopped tattoos, Wayne updates what it means to be the best rapper alive here. Gangster dandy. Fender-slinging sex god. Intergalactic prankster. It's all in him.","Nine years after his first solo LP, and on the heels of an unprecedented glut of increasingly remarkable mixtape and internet leaks, Lil Wayne produces Tha Carter III, the epic culmination of a lifetime of eccentricities.

Lake Toba / Ailanthus,Lukestar,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b666b1335d7bf169aa60/1:1/w_160/44077a4b.jpg,2008-06-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11684-lake-tobaailanthus/,Phone Me,"My first impression of Truls Heggero was neither positive nor, fortunately, reliable. Moments after I popped in Truls & the Trees' debut album, Ailanthus, into my computer, I unfolded the CD insert and found the poster of the Norwegian singer/songwriter/mastermind dressed in full Boy Scout garb (or the Scandinavian equivalent), holding an acoustic guitar and looking pensively into the distance-- a visionary in arrested development. Initially I feared this would be just another indie-cute collective with overly twee hooks and lyrics that could have come from The Dangerous Book for Boys, but soon realized how off base I was. Heggero may be a prodigiously ambitious musician with a gift for witty, sprawling arrangements full of offbeat instrumentation and plenty of musical gambits (not unlike fellow Scout uniform wearer Sufjan Stevens), but his songs rarely announce themselves as particularly over the top or elaborate. He wants to deliver the goods directly to the listener-- the demonstrative hook, the headlong jam, the thrumming ambience, the unexpected coda-- and it only helps that his vocals range from androgynous and adenoidal (think Isaac Brock via Placebo's Brian Molko) to a stage-whisper falsetto suggestive of Sigur Rós's Jon Thor Birgisson. Apparently, Heggero's brain runneth over, such that he needs not one, but two bands to get all his ideas out there. Releasing albums just months apart, the spacier Lukestar and the earthier Truls & the Trees show off slightly different aspects of his musical personality. Of the two, Lukestar's Lake Toba, the follow-up to 2004's Alpine Unit, has received more attention and is slated for a U.S. release this fall on Flameshovel. The title refers to the Sumatran volcanic lake that erupted eons ago and may have changed the course of human evolution. So much for modesty. Nevertheless, it's perhaps the more accessible, if not necessarily the more enjoyable, of the two albums, a solid collection of pulsing indie-rock songs with half-shouted hooks and guitars unwinding like fractal art. Opener ""White Shade"" and ""The Shade You Hide"" are Wrensy frenzies of manic guitars propelled by drummer Jørgen Smådal Larsen's tricky rhythms and imaginative fills. ""The Clouds Tell"" offers a floating-in-space interlude before the band blast off again on the zig-zagging ""In a Hologram"". Still, the album winds down as it proceeds: Lukestar can't maintain that creative intensity, letting the hooks soften and the arrangements lose some of their purposefulness. Conceptually, Truls & the Trees works as a rustic flipside-project to Lukestar: Instead of a firm five-piece, it's a loosely defined collective ranging from six to sixteen members, depending on the time and place. To call the group an earthy counterpart doesn't mean the Trees are strictly acoustic or folksy, just less streamlined and more grounded. They even open their debut, Ailanthus (named for the fast-growing deciduous often referred to as the ""tree of heaven""), with ""Aim Vs. Signal"", a full minute of squiggling synths. Similarly, these songs squirm away from expectations. Dag Stiberg's saxophone opens up the halting ""Mystaxxx"", making its dreamy atmospherics sound all the richer as drummer Larsen taps out Morse code rhythms on his snare rim, and ""Count Your Steps"" and the title track both race impatiently, doing somersaults as they run downhill. Stand-out ""Upside Journey"" sports an emphatic hook and a barreling momentum, then crashes into a Dexy's Midnight Runners breakdown on the coda. The one real joykill is closer ""Topquark Journey to the Center of the Universe"", which revisits ""Upside Journey"" but in a stiffly electronic style that ends the album on an uncharacteristically humdrum note. Still, while Lukestar's rock-band format necessarily limits their range, Truls & the Trees aren't quite a rock band or quite anything else, and with that unsettledness comes the freedom to do anything they want.","Norway's Truls Heggero-- a prodigiously ambitious musician with a gift for witty, sprawling arrangements full of offbeat instrumentation and plenty of musical gambits-- exhibits his rock (Lukestar) and rustic (Truls & the Trees) sides on two recent releases.

Charmed & Strange,Yoav,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b658b1335d7bf169aa45/1:1/w_160/cbeba4bc.jpg,2008-06-11 06:00:05,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11559-charmed-strange/,Verve Forecast,"Well, here's one you don't read every day around these parts: RIYL Keller Williams, Howie Day. Like eating Dippin' Dots or watching ""The Jetsons"", listening to the Israeli-born Yoav's debut is akin to experiencing yesterday's future today, in this case, the one-man band running his guitar through a looping delay pedal. But while previous progenitors of this form have come from a singer-songwriter/jam band background, Yoav's hook is that he's a student of dance music, as much of a Björk as a Buckley. And this approach has the potential for admirable results, since it's probably xenophobic and certainly factually incorrect to say that acoustic guitars and repetitive structure aren't conducive to body moving. But at the center of Charmed & Strange is one giant miscalculation-- Yoav is trying to approximate American club music, to become, in his words, a ""one-man Timbaland band,"" a hubristic claim that's almost charmingly naïve, considering even Timbo needs an extra pair of (Danja) handz these days. Regardless of how good this could possibly sound in theory, in practice Charmed & Strange rarely amounts to something much different from that jagweed at your local college watering hole covering ""SexyBack"" because he thinks it's a total laugh riot. For all of the melting-pot promise, *Charmed & Strange * feels more like the worst of all worlds summit of songwriter weakness-- Jose Gonzalez's tendency towards sonic similarity without the skill and delicacy, ""Punk'd"" Justin Timberlake without SNL Justin Timberlake, Dave Matthews' leering lasciviousness without...well, you get the idea. Blame a flawed business plan; no matter how many layers of simulated keyboards or percussion he slathers on, Yoav sounds completely alone at all times; like the acoustic cover of ""Boyz In The Hood"", a tenuous show of genuine love is inevitably overshadowed by having no real investment in physical place. Which brings Yoav's voice to the forefront and with it, a subtle twist of obnoxiousness in its sharp falsetto and ""Mark E. Smith in da club"" inflections. ""You'll be nuttin' but a club thing/ What would you say to be paid, to be one of the beautiful?"" ""Adore, adore/ Kneel down before""-- such is typical of Yoav's lyrical mien, which would be embarrassing enough in its own right, but it's exponentially worse in context of tracks that bear more in common with Nebraska than Ibiza; like so many other facets of Strange & Charmed, Yoav earnestly builds with the wrong set of tools. Or chalk it up to him yoking this record to one of the worst guitar sounds I've heard in some time, ridding the acoustics of all natural luster and range for the sort of cheap slapback delay familiar to anyone who's purchased a multi-effects processor under serious budget constraints. At least on ""Adore Adore"", he manages a sort of Kraut-ish trance similar to Iron & Wine's ""On Your Wings"", but Yoav breaks any sense of placidity with his overwrought accusations. Meanwhile, ""One By One"" is typical of the record's balance, songs that take too long to screw its way deeper into quicksand. It hints at propulsion, but never takes off because it could really use real drums, not a thumping approximation of them. With both indie and dance embracing a wider range of textures than ever, what sense does it make to limit yourself so severely? Charmed & Strange ends with a predictably curious cover of ""Where Is My Mind,"" and needless to say, it's no ""$20"". But even if you thought M.I.A.'s version was genius or merely tacky Pazz & Jop bait, it shows the comparative failure of Yoav's approach, which ignores that interdependence is a more advanced social relation than independence. Even though Maya has an unquestionably individual vision, she has enough confidence to seek out the strengths of others to help her achieve it, whether it's outside collaborators, producers, or samples. Yoav goes about his expecting some sort of kneejerk praise for rolling dolo, but thanks to a total lack of depth, sonic or otherwise, all I see is the gimmicks, the wack lyrics. Shit is depressing.","Israel-born singer-songwriter who infuses his acoustic pop tunes with beats wants to be a ""one-man Timbaland band."" Well...

Small-Time Machine,Cassettes Won't Listen,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b626c0084474cd0c253f/1:1/w_160/60776025.jpg,2008-06-11 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11513-small-time-machine/,self-released,"Cassettes Won't Listen is the electronic pop project of Brooklyn's Jason Drake. For his day job, Drake works in marketing for the hip-hop label Def Jux, and he brings his business acumen to the presentation of his own work. After spending the last two years on a stream of remixes (of Midlake, Asobi Seksu, Aesop Rock, and many others), last December he released a free download-only covers EP called One Alternative, whose artwork and song selection (tunes by Pavement, Liz Phair, Sebadoh) were meant to inspire nostalgia in the generation that came of age in the post-Nirvana era. But while Drake has had some moderate success marrying the organic and glossy with the odd remix or cover, Small-Time Machine-- a seven-song, 30-minute album that feels much longer-- meets with more difficulty. Comparisons have been made between Cassettes Won't Listen and electro-pop outfits like the Postal Service and the Notwist, but neither rings true. Unlike the Postal Service's Ben Gibbard, who had the luxury of laying his gut-punch turns of phrase over Jimmy Tamborello's lunar soundscapes, Drake is working alone and with less sonic imagination. Without the lyrical muscle of Gibbard (or one-time Tamborello associate Conor Oberst), his electronic backdrops don't have the color or edge to distinguish themselves. But the album's most striking weakness can't be chalked up to any shortage of hooky beat construction or bad poetry; rather, it's Drake's inability-- unlike, say, the Notwist's Markus Acher-- to integrate his often scratchy, Doug Martsch-biting vocals as an instrument into the mix. To live with songs by a one-man band is to be alone with that man and his thoughts, so it's best if he can either invite you in or transport you elsewhere. With so much glitchy, bad CGI-like synth scramble in the way, Small-Time Machine becomes an unfortunate push-and-pull between equally hyperprocessed elements. Which leaves us in kind of a bind, because as much as Small-Time Machine feels like kitchen sinking gone awry, there are a few moments of pop transcendence, most notably at the album's halfway mark. After a rough initial stretch that includes the more abrasive chug and scrape of ""Large Radio"" and single ""Paper Float"", Drake opens up his vocal chords a bit and bounces up off the ropes with what could be the album's centerpiece. ""Freeze and Explode"" boasts blindfolded guitar lines that snake in and out of a chorus that Drake not only sings but drives home with a clarity sorely missing from the rest of the record. It's sort of weird to think about someone like Ben Gibbard casting such an imposing shadow over Pentium rock. But just seconds after the aforementioned track closes, one more highlight in the lilting but clubby ""The Broadcast"" presents itself, if only because it bears the most palpable resemblance to Death Cab for Cutie. Which is totally cool, but it also makes that copy of the Postal Service's Give Up seem all the more appetizing right about now.","The first physical release from the Brooklyn-based one-man electro-pop project, last heard from on the download-only One Alternative covers EP.

Laulu Laakson Kukista,Paavoharju,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b65513d197565213adf0/1:1/w_160/f0c5a3ab.jpg,2008-06-11 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11555-laulu-laakson-kukista/,Fonal,"For any band with the willingness or capability to write actual tunes, critics and fans are apt to see anything else-- interludes, instrumentals, experiments-- as a digression. I understand and partially accept that this is what you are choosing to do when you are not singing me a song. These are the aural equivalents of John Steinbeck's turtle, often treated with the indifference and puzzlement afforded the itinerant reptile in your average high school book report; folks were known to edit off the ambient bits of even Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, an album renowned for its meld of song and abstraction. Finnish collective Paavoharju are obstinate in their attempts to buck this trend, scattering Europop, pastel electronics, and woolen drones like a tossed deck of Bicycle playing cards. The greatest achievement of Paavoharju's Laulu Laakson Kukista, though, is not its dexterous balance of song and sound but the way it invests you as heavily in field recordings, dub workouts, and quasi-classical think pieces as in the band's foreign-language hookmaking. Ostensibly a ""songs"" album, Laulu only gradually reveals their scarcity: count six using the standard ""Could I maybe put this on a mixtape for my coworkers if, in fact, my coworkers were into entropic Nordic dance-pop?"" benchmark. In place of half of a classic pop album, Laulu doesn't redefine out-music so much as find clever and inventive ways to incorporate it. Like its predecessor-- Paavoharju's 2005 debut Yhä Hämärää-- Laulu opens with ""Pimeänkarkelo"", a track that ceases to be an ""intro"" around the two minute mark and carries on for twice that anyway, ultimately serving as a palate cleanser for the surprisingly tart headrush of ""Kevätrumpu"". Kinetic synths and lovingly cheesed-out drums bleat and whir like dancin' music at a 1992 rollerblade disco. A stressed, sexed female voice coos and circles and punches like she's got Madonna's biceps but not those under-eye bags. And then...variations on a plinky piano melody in the form of ""Tuoksu Tarttuu Meihin"", which mulls and ponders amid a static curtain. When the band later remembers the melody on the album's two shortest tracks they feel less like interludes and more like rounding back to an earlier conversation after a thorough and fulfilling detour. Downtempo dub. Song. Weird pastel electronica. Song. Laulu is structured much like Yhä Hämärää and the line between should be drawn using confidence, or perhaps perseverance. Mulish is too ugly a word for Laulu, whose compositions are stubbornly given room to flower and expand but are always appropriately reined; instead let's say that Paavoharju have a well-developed internal clock, or are otherwise familiar with ""The Ugly Duckling"". ""Kirkonväki"" outgrows its watery piano and malfunctioning click-track to blossom into a goth-rock prom, replete with organs in waltz-time stumble. ""Uskallan"" features a male lead so clear-throated and dramatic that the song sounds like one of the early 90s Latin-American hits that increasingly populate Chicago's jukeboxes. ""Sumuvirsi"", a rhythm-less, female-led hymn whose second-most prominent sound is a cackling raven, hues closest to the psych-folk traditional to Fonal's roster, but even it seems more theatrical and dramatic, like Paavoharju have been taking their cues both from Eleanoora Rosenholm and high-school drama productions. The tiny honking synths that augment the rusty guitars of ""Tyttö Tanssii"" suggest a more literal reading of the Bicycle metaphor from above: a hill of two-wheelers, disheveled rubber, tassels, and bells. Laulu connotes this youth, motion, and playfulness in various states of repair and construction, and it does so by alternating well-formed, multi-faced pop songs with abstract head-scratchers, each component as warmly evocative and strangely necessary as the last.","Finnish collective on the Fonal label scatters Europop, rustic folk, pastel electronics, and woolen drones like a tossed deck of playing cards.

Takes,Adem,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5aeb335119a49eca01/1:1/w_160/29d17a78.jpg,2008-06-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11583-takes/,Domino,"The feeling that the world used to be better, clearer, or more pure has been historically persistent enough to suggest that it's a fundamental part of being human, and it logically encompasses music as well. Arguments against reactionary ideologies such as rockism often hang upon accusations of social prejudice, which certainly can be a component of it. But there's a more empathetic and equally plausible explanation: It's not that new music is inferior to old music (although the feeling often gets twisted this way), but that older music's obsolescence can make us uncomfortably aware that the same thing could, and likely will, happen to much of what we listen to today. Being trapped in this relentless forward momentum, with losses stacking up behind us, perhaps explains why, as popular music moves ever forward, the individuals creating it tend to move backwards. Punks eventually try their hand at country, indie rockers get into classic rock, and Adem, aka the guy from Fridge who isn't Four Tet, puts aside post-rock and neo-folk long enough to record Takes, a largely acoustic album of unpretentious covers rendered more emotionally than cerebrally. Takes mainly consists of Adem's charismatic voice and deft acoustic guitar, although a kitchen sink's worth of embellishments, from vibraphone to dulcimer to autoharp, flesh it out. It has a heavy nostalgia component, as all of the covered songs were originally released between 1991 and 2001, Adem's self-professed formative years. This lends it a backwards-looking, ""120 Minutes"" vibe, and bolsters its sense of longing regression. You can tell from Adem's earnest renditions that what he's singing here is less a collection of covers than a specific, intensely personal vision of his life. His evident love of his source material and the material's alternative-era continuity make Takes a vanity project that's much better and more universally appealing than what we usually mean by the term. Adem renders his source material in a homogeneous style, so that it actually sounds like a bona fide album whose rewards aren't contingent upon familiarity with the covered songs. For anyone who was young in the 90s, however, familiarity will augment its appeal. The best part of Takes is Adem's song choices, which tend to be surprising even when the artist choices are not. The feeling of burgeoning recognition is so pleasurable that I'd advise listening to the album before you read the track list, or the rest of this review. It's a lot of fun to listen to a lyrical, hammer-on intensive acoustic melody with a sense of near-maddening familiarity until a certain lyric makes you realize that you're listening to Smashing Pumpkins B-side ""Starla"", spliced with a bit of Gish's ""Window Paine"". This splicing speaks to Adem's infectious, fanboy enthusiasm in constructing this album, which reportedly came about because fans frequently ask him for recordings of the solo covers he plays live. When he couldn't settle on just one track from a beloved artist, he simply hybridized two. So a loping, easygoing version of Bedhead's ""Bedside Table"" mingles with a bit of ""The End of the Day"", and Aphex Twin's ""To Cure a Weakling Child"" and ""Boy/Girl Song"" get wrapped up in one twittering, bell-laden folk number. (Yes, Adem not only transcribed Aphex Twin songs for acoustic guitar, but he did a great job of it-- its gentle, upsweeping chorus is an album highlight.) Plus, he's got a nice voice, and a nice voice is crucial for this material. It's just rough-edged enough to sound ""alternative,"" but versatile enough to assimilate Björk's gulpy murmur (on a hovering version of ""Unravel""), PJ Harvey's gruff purr (on an ornately finger-picked ""Oh My Lover""), and Yo La Tengo's laundry-fresh harmonies (on a weary yet oddly uplifting ""Tears Are in Your Eyes""). Mix in some Lisa Germano (""Slide""), Pinback (""Loro""), Breeders (""Invisible Man""), and Tortoise (a pretty but negligible ""Gamera""-- the instrumental doesn't quite suit this vocal-centric album), and you've got a veritable '90s nostalgia-bomb on your hands. And maybe it's at least accidentally significant, as regards the desire to stop time and preserve lost innocence, that the most recent cover was released in 2001, right before a few hijacked airplanes set in motion a chain of events that would make life more complicated and perilous for most everyone.","Adem, aka the guy from Fridge who isn't Four Tet, puts aside post-rock and neo-folk long enough to record Takes, a largely acoustic album of unpretentious covers rendered more emotionally than cerebrally.

EP,Crystal Antlers,by: Ian Cohen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13cc0084474cd0bfd7b/1:1/w_160/7cc341e2.jpg,2008-06-11 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11580-ep/,self-released,"There aren't many bands I've listened to more than Crystal Antlers this year, but I still don't think there's an optimum way to hear them yet. If the buzz sends you to MySpace, you'll get their impact but not their dynamics. Catch one of their cramped live shows and you'll get their in-it-to-win-it intensity but not their expansiveness. Hear their self-released EP, and you're getting closer-- besides existing at the cross-section of so many styles, the disc finds the band at a more important nexus of potential and realization. In person, Crystal Antlers look like outcasts from six different bands, and at various points on this record, they sound like it, too: Merging psych, garage, lo-fi, prog, and countless other influences, the group easily maintains consistency despite a complete inability to be pinned to any specific movement or trend (so long as you're not counting the increasingly frustrating trend of unimaginative bandnames). You might come across comparisons to Les Savy Fav, an appropriate call if you consider it shorthand for ""relentlessly energetic band with crowd-pleasing stage antics."" EP's opener ""A Thousand Eyes"" is evidence enough of that: Beginning with doomy, lo-fi minor arpeggios, it soon explodes into a Latin-influenced rumble before the band piledrives into a swaggering psych hook, the track sounds something like if Comets on Fire inverted their ratio of chaos-to-craft. Beneath the squall, ""Vexation""'s headsnapping pace and flesh-searing bass riff could be a Stooges-style punk shoutalong. The organ riff that ""Owl"" pogos on is a found relic from late-1960s Venice Beach with a monolithic vocal melody. And like any long-haired throwback worth its bongos, EP ends with the loosest and longest number, the seven-minute swamp lurch of ""Parting Song for the Torn Sky"". As much as it diverges from the brain-frying aim of typical psych-rock outings, EP is an unorthodox summer record-- not so much for driving to the beach as actually being in its sweltering grasp, equal parts scorched earth and wide open spaces. Credit to producer Ikey Owens (aka Mars Volta's keyboardist-- there's hope!) for finding enough room for every instrument, few of which act in their traditional scope. If you find yourself humming any of the riffs, odds are they'll come from singer Jonny Bell, who treats his bass like a six-string while guitar (check the appropriate titanic ""Arcturus"") and organ provide shading under an ozone of reverb that, like early My Morning Jacket, gives an impression of an expansive soundworld the band can grow into. It's tempting to be patient and call this disc a stopgap on the way to a triumphant debut full-length. But EP is plenty substantial as is; at 25 minutes, it's only a few shy of Nouns or, more to the point, any number of psych-rock classics from decades past.

What begins as a potentially go-nowhere dirge erupts into a brief out-of-the-past acid-rock freakout, the maxed out guitars mingling uneasily with strings and woodwinds, not to mention singer Gillian Chadwick's deceptively pure voice. As the album progresses, you keep waiting for a similar outburst of fuzz guitar frenzy, but it never really arrives, at least not with such fervor. More often than not, the disc sticks to vaguely Eastern mysticism and medieval witchy-pooisms, a mix of incense and Ouija boards, delivered with total sincerity and off the charts portentousness. ""There's a force behind me, more powerful than you think,"" intones Chadwick in ""Clouds? Or Smoke?"". She's aiming for menace, but as far as stuff meant to spook you into submission goes, Ex Reverie is pretty mellow, neither particularly mean nor mysterious, and bogged down with flowery lyrical flourishes, like late-night notebook musings unleashed. They're actually perfectly suited to the mostly languid prog-folk songs, which themselves favor trancelike drifting over intricate assaults. It must stink to have your heart in another time but to be stuck here in 2008, though The Door Into Summer is surprisingly light on tension, let alone the mild cognitive dissonance of anachronism. The Renaissance fair-ready ""Wooden Sword"", for example, is all the unintentionally funnier for its po-faced seriousness, while the swirling dress hippie pop of ""Days Away"" sounds stolen straight from some Haight-Ashbury vault. Yet when Ex Reverie stumbles on something special-- a killer riff, or an interesting arrangement-- the group at least recognizes its potential. ""Dawn Comes For Us All"", for example, pushes forward on the back of an ultra-cool slo-mo Godzilla vs. Sabbath-styled churn, albeit one with more space stirred into the mix; the song's a cappella vocals and handclaps breakdown is an album highlight. Earlier, ""The Crowning"" sticks to its deliberate tempo and pace, making the intertwining guitar solos of its coda more effective. As strong a recreation of another era-- let alone another dimension-- The Door Into Summer may strive to be, its effects never quite transcend its affections, and in the end, it's still a few pours short of a full flagon of mead. It's channeling way too hard, like a novice psychic nervous around her supervisor when all she needs to do is relax and let the spirits come.","More folk-prog Rennaissance fair music from the folks at Language of Stone, all dressed up and looking backwards.

When Horses Die,Thomas Brinkmann,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b650c0084474cd0c2585/1:1/w_160/30207ae4.jpg,2008-06-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11550-when-horses-die/,Max Ernst,"It's a great coincidence that Thomas Brinkmann's name, minus the ""Brink,"" is identical to that of another magisterial German moralist, as his long career serves as a corrective to the lingering prejudice that techno music is fundamentally hedonistic and/or mindless. At almost-50, his elder statesman status feels earned, and the aloof whiff of philosophy in his music is softened by his hands-on, exploratory touch. He's never been afraid to reinvent techno and its tools for his own devices. The remixes on which he made his name involved his own specially modified turntables and records, with shapes actually etched into the vinyl, and on his last album, Klick Revolution, he imagined minimal techno as a cicada language that makes Ellen Allien's Sool sound like M83 by comparison. When Horses Die is a techno-singer/songwriter album reminiscent of Matthew Dear's Asa Breed, but where Dear's electronic cabaret was mostly bright and fizzy, Brinkmann's is riveted in jet-black steel. Its intellectual content is literally literary, with the same surrealistic bent he betrayed in naming his label Max Ernst: Its title comes from a poem by Russian Futurist Velimir Khlebnikov, and while Brinkmann penned the lyrics for three tracks himself, most of them are appropriated from the likes of American land artist Robert Smithson (of ""Spiral Jetty"" fame), Tuxedomoon's Winston Tong, and Russian poets Joseph Brodsky and Marina Zwetajewa. The dominant themes are love and devotion, although rendered in Brinkmann's gravelly, drawling baritone, devotion's seamy underbelly-- a dark, helpless thrall-- comes into the open. This is especially apparent on When Horses Die's first three tracks, which are its most striking-- their glacial tempos and staggering weights seems to freeze the clock's hands as Brinkmann's voice echoes down, seemingly from somewhere far away and long ago. ""Words"" consists of a few glowing notes of piano in a slush of carefully controlled feedback, and Brinkmann's vocal somehow manages to be both spectral and anvil-heavy. This thick atmosphere continues through ""Spiral"" and ""Birth & Death"": The former is a steam-hissing meditation built on a wrap-around synth tone, while the latter is an industrial march whose Teutonic rigidity makes for a good segue into the album's other mode. I'm torn on this second mode: The contrast is welcome, but the idea of an entire album with the pace and gravity of the first three tracks is seductive. At any rate, an affinity beyond Dear (and how did I get this far without mentioning Suicide?) crops up in the album's midsection: namely, Trent Reznor, who is thanked in the album's liner notes, and whom Brinkmann told XLR8R was a big influence for When Horses Die (along with Joy Division and Stina Nordenstam). Beginning with ""Meadow"", time speeds up like a Guy Ritchie film trick, and Brinkmann embarks across a midtempo pop-industrial landscape rich with precisely graphed percussion, spongey synths, and low-flying bass. It's well-turned and enjoyable, but seems a bit mundane next to the otherworldly dirges, a mode that returns, briefly, on the mirage-like ""Uselessness"", and on closing track ""40"", which reprises the opening track's ethereal piano. It's jarring to go down a rabbit hole, only to find yourself suddenly shunted into the swarming, lively anthill of the album's midsection, but maybe that's precisely Brinkmann's angle-- like an expert hypnotist, he knows how to snap us back to reality just before we get too deep.","Restless electronic pioneer has created a techno-singer/songwriter album reminiscent of Matthew Dear's Asa Breed, but where Dear's electronic cabaret was mostly bright and fizzy, Brinkmann's is riveted in jet-black steel.

Noise Won't Stop,Shy Child,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b65213d197565213adea/1:1/w_160/e7c14063.jpg,2008-06-10 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11552-noise-wont-stop/,Kill Rock StarsWall of SoundKill Rock StarsWall of Sound,"The second most charming thing about dance-rock duo Shy Child and their obsession with rhythm is that it's never entirely clear where they're taking their cues from-- like, does first single ""Drop the Phone"" sound more like recent Timbaland or one of the early singles from the Strokes? The most charming thing is that they don't sound like they care very much: who else would try to ride to fame on a piece of syncopated synthetic new wave skiffle singing about, literally, dropping a phone (as far as I can tell anyway)? But ""Drop the Phone"", as with most of Shy Child's third album Noise Won't Stop, is deeply lovable in spite of, or perhaps because of these unanswerable questions. ""Drop the Phone"" lays out the basic brief of Shy Child's sound: burbling, whining synthesizers occupying the roles of both rhythm and lead guitar, urgent-sounding multi-tracked vocals (falling into the categories of ""rather yelping"" and ""very yelping"") that sound like they're being recorded into several megaphones in the next room, and cavernous, clattering drums that do their best to crowd everything else off stage, including the performances of singer Pete Cafarella. Cafarella's caffeinated performances survive and even benefit from this struggle for attention, partly because he can operate only in the registers of excited and extremely excited, and partly because his songs were never meant to be the focus anyway. While Shy Child are confined to tight, catchy verse-chorus structures, it's the song's status as a structure that makes it useful-- a structure around which to festoon an absurdly generous array of rhythmic ideas, and a parade of dazzling hook after dazzling hook. Cafarella and fellow member Nate Smith have judged correctly: it's when Shy Child's grip on songcraft grows extremely tenuous that their music becomes interesting, even thrilling: from the schizophrenic ""Generation Y (We Got It)"" (imagine Junior Senior making Caribbean pop) to the overblown glam-stomp of ""Astronaut"" (keyboard vamps and counter-rhythms and overlapping vocal parts careening around like a wobbling, top-heavy spinning top), Shy Child's best work uses the pop song form as a grocery list for their favorite musical tricks rather than as a self-contained entity-- you can almost hear their childlike glee when they realize they can get away with a pompous Genesis-style keyboard solo on ""Astronaut"" if they briefly pretend they're actually Wolfmother (note: thankfully they don't sound at all like Wolfmother). Noise Won't Stop doesn't feel like it has noticeably weak tracks, but there are certainly moments when Shy Child sound less remarkable, less worthy of distinction-- usually when they focus on trying to make proper songs after all. I'm sure that the propulsive sprint of ""Summer"" will be the favorite of many listeners: with its vaguely allusive (although perhaps just vague) tale of a final youthful whine of intransigence before subsiding into conformity, it's probably the song that best presents the duo as a full package, and even suggests they might have ""something to say"". But it's also the least interesting thing here, its stripped-back, pounding groove attack evoking images of college kids getting their minds blown by Trans Am's Futureworld. Conversely, Noise Won't Stop's best moment is the unabashed trance-pop of album closer ""Cause and Effect"", which reminds me curiously of ""Don't Give Up"", Bryan Adams' millennial trance-pop collaboration with Chicane. Here, the group's maximalist synthesizer pyrotechnics are exploited to a ridiculous extent, morphing from DJ Sammy-style atmospheric arpeggios through acid house bleeping and finally settling into the woozy warp speed churn of goa trance, sort of. Where ""Don't Give Up"" seemed to achieve its yearning soar a little too easily (soaring being the natural state of trance-pop), ""Cause and Effect"" benefits from the friction between the music's effortless lift-off and Cafarella's grounded call and response chanting. It's probably the best rock song and the best trance song I've heard this year, and as a side-benefit shows up just how myopic the usual conceptions of ""dance-rock"" can be-- almost the first thought that ran through my head was ""why hasn't someone tried this before?"" Perhaps it's simply that no other band working in this area seems so blissfully unconcerned about touching on the right reference points-- at least, not without a carefully arranged smirk already in place. In their faux-naif openness, Shy Child are perhaps closer to Swedish dance-pop duo the Tough Alliance than to anyone else, to the point that at first I was disappointed that Noise Won't Stop wasn't more sweet, more romantic, more fey-- more, in short, like the Tough Alliance themselves. What sets Shy Child apart is their residual muscularity, even masculinity: as surprising and inventive and occasionally cheesy as they are, they inhabit an iron-grip tension, alert and wide-eyed and on a hair-trigger at all times-- if the Tough Alliance sound effortless, Shy Child see dance music as something like an athletic training ground. Maybe this is why so many of their songs seem to be about the power of their own grooves (just see the song titles: ""Kick Drum"", ""The Volume"", ""Noise Won't Stop"")-- it's as if they're expending an immense amount of energy in wringing these sounds from their machines, and they can't afford to divert their attention by singing about anything else. I suspect that this masculinity is Shy Child's secret weapon. For all the dance-rock we've enjoyed and suffered through these last few years, there's precious few examples of bands being able to express their sweaty rock principles through (as opposed to alongside or even against) their dancefloor rhythms. For Shy Child, immersion in non-stop rhythm is just about the most ""rock"" thing they can do.","New York synth-pop/dance-rock duo seem blissfully unconcerned about touching on the right reference points here on their latest, which was originally issued in the UK in 2007 and is now out in North America via Kill Rock Stars.

Diamond Hoo Ha,Supergrass,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6435e6ef959693228e9/1:1/w_160/8857db52.jpg,2008-06-10 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11538-diamond-hoo-ha/,Astralwerks,"Supergrass aren't young anymore (by their own scale, of course; they're, ahem, in their early thirties), and they've reached a stage when they can recall and relive what it was like to be kids. Back to 1994, to be specific, when the trio emerged as gleefully stonerific teenage moppets who turned down Steven Spielberg's offer to make them into the new Monkees, then brilliantly named their underrated second album We're in It for the Money. Instead of taking the (dubious) quick-fame route, the band opted for the more conventional approach: issuing variations on its identifiable brand of good-natured, druggy, arena-sized bubble-glam over the next 13 years and four albums, and establishing itself as one of the most dependable and popular purveyors of outsize British pop-rock (in the UK, that is; in the U.S., they've topped out at #195). They're back to their hijinks again on Diamond Hoo Ha, but from the perspective of, well, a band which opens for the Foo Fighters in basketball arenas. Though much of Hoo Ha returns to chronicling the same sort of less-than-legal lifestyle that made ""Caught by the Fuzz"" such an invigorating attention-getter at the height of the Britpop moment, the underlying sentiments have mellowed as Supergrass have grown up, something easily visible by glancing through the band's catalog. In 1994, a 17-year-old Gaz Coombes fretted from the back of a paddywagon about what his mum and older brother would do when they discovered he been busted for blow; on Hoo Ha's expansive ""When I Needed You"", Coombes is ""in the back of a stolen car, going 80 with the headlights off"" (metaphorically, I'm assuming-- he's a rich adult now), while pining for a less-specific form of guidance. Later, a sordid nightclub visit leads to what reads like post-infidelity guilt on ""345"", and even the album's most insatiable pop bangers, ""Rebel in You"" and ""Ghost of a Friend"" are swathed in personal nostalgia, celebrating excess and temperance at the same time. Supergrass worked with producer Nick Launay-- who helmed the last three Bad Seeds albums-- to grime things up a bit, and Hoo Ha's first two songs (and singles) ""Diamond Hoo Ha Man"" and ""Bad Blood"", showcase a harder yet still familiar image of the group. The blurry, drug-fueled debauchery and dirty riff-rock is more Queens of the Stone Age than Bolan and Bowie, and plenty vampiric: The title character is some sort of dealer/door-to-door salesman with an afterhours work schedule including seedy hotels, whose business card reads: ""When the sun goes down/ I can't resist"", then ""Bite me!"" The shady ""Rough Knuckles"" protagonist also holes up at by-the-night residences, but in the chorus, Coombes, never one to wallow, drags him out into the light and sets him up as an ""outlaw on the run."" It should be an appropriate costume for the band to wear, but it's still the case that Supergrass is at its best when making streetlit skulking into A Hard Day's Night instead of taking a stab at Trainspotting. The triumphal ode ""The Return of..."" is bait, of course, Supergrass telling us in no uncertain terms that they're back to their old tricks again. The verses, a slight nod to end-is-nigh politics and bullying of the more interpersonal sort, march past militaristically, but when the chorus switches meter and turns woozy, the hint is more than received that the source of inspiration is more than likely still the band's own Hoo Ha Man. Similarly, ""Whiskey & Green Tea"", about a post-festival night out in Beijing, aims to be a lost in translation free-for-all, but plays more as an enthusiastically told blurry tourist tale. Maybe ""Whiskey""'s the key to why Diamond Hoo Ha doesn't register as the satisfying return-to-form it tries so hard to be: stories about getting fucked up do often get less interesting as the tellers get older. It's that, but also that their sonic schtick wears a little thin here. Supergrass's Original Variations on Electric Warrior-- their pitch-perfect admixture of boogie-based power-pop and spacy rumination-- is still wonderful to revisit, but their attempt to reinvigorate it on this record is like the dirty, partially-satisfying buzz you get from smoking that roach you found under the car floormat. I'm assuming they didn't mean for the name of the album to register as ironic as In it for the Money or Road to Rouen, but Diamond Hoo Ha does seem like an apt description of the glittery nonsense contained within.","Britpop's most flat-out enjoyable band continue to learn to age gracefully, here working with Bad Seeds producer Nick Launay, who showcases a harder yet still familiar image of the group.

Robert Pollard Is Off to Business,Robert Pollard,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb765e6ef95969322bff/1:1/w_160/121215f6.jpg,2008-06-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11604-robert-pollard-is-off-to-business/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","There's really no twist with Robert Pollard Is Off to Business, which maybe qualifies it as the greatest twist Pollard's pulled off in his post-GBV career. Composed of 10 songs clocking in at an average of three-and-a-half minutes each, Business showcases Pollard at his most conventional since, well, probably ever. He's also never leaned so heavily on long-time producer/multi-instrumentalist Todd Tobias, whose lush, expansive arrangements make Business sound shockingly MOR, especially coming from the king of tape hiss. Yet despite what sounds on paper like an over-the-hill artist throwing in the towel and finally sounding his age, Business only further attests to Pollard's unique abilities. Always one to seek pop bliss from the most seemingly unpalatable places, Pollard approaches his classic rock influences on their own terms here. While 1970s power pop, arena rock, and MOR bands have always flavored his canon, he's never interpreted them as literally as he does on these meaty numbers. Whereas Pollard's previous album (Superman Was a Rocker, released just a few moons ago) saw him retooling old instrumental tracks, Business basically retools his record recollection. Just listen to how the stutter-stepping acoustic guitar of opener ""The Original Heart"" cops Led Zep's Houses of the Holy opener ""The Song Remains the Same"", or the acoustic pop charm of Big Star clones ""The Blondes"" and ""Wealth and Hell-Being"". Just as the lo-fi vs. hi-fi debate has always been pretty fruitless with earlier material, Pollard's super hi-fi sound on Business isn't any more the story here than the suddenly slick production was on, say, 1996's professional-sounding Under the Bushes Under the Stars. ""Gratification to Concrete"" may feature a wah-wah guitar effect set to ""Frampton"", but ultimately it's muscular pop that can be learned in forty bucks worth of guitar lessons. Despite regal strings and an Eastern-tinged guitar, ""To the Path!"" isn't trying to match ""Kashmir""'s bombast, especially when a proudly disjointed riff deflates the track's dramatic heightening. In case you're still concerned Pollard's gone heavy-handed on us, there's also loads of brainy power pop (""1 Years Old"" being a highlight) and an ugly acoustic ballad titled ""Confessions of a Teenage Jerk-Off"". Although Business ultimately ranks as yet another less-than-legendary offering from a living indie legend, its shortcomings are much more nuanced than typical Pollard releases. Not one track here merits swift deletion; Pollard packs too many ideas and sections into each one to render any completely unredeemable. The obvious drawback, though, is a relatively sluggish pace, especially on a grungey number like ""No One But I"" or closer ""Wealth and Hell-Being""'s neverending outro. Still, Pollard embraces his rock icons at their most overblown here, and, despite his canon stretching around the world, Business manages to sound like something we haven't quite heard before on previous Pollard albums.","Robert Pollard's latest-- which he claims will be his only 2008 release-- showcases the prolific songwriter at his most conventional, leaning heavily on long-time producer/ multi-instrumentalist Todd Tobias and his lush, expansive arrangements.

Welcome,James Pants,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b654ea9e61561daa6f62/1:1/w_160/c24d9161.jpg,2008-06-09 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11554-welcome/,Stones Throw,"This usually isn't something readers (or writers) take into account when it comes to this site's reviews, but you might want to consider that rating up there a purely vestigial placeholder this time around. A 5.0-- basically 2.5/5 stars-- is essentially ""not good, but not awful,"" which is an evaluation that kept coming to mind on the first few listens to this debut from the Stones Throw intern-turned-roster member. But it's also supposed to mean ""mediocre""-- and nothing this willfully odd can really be considered mediocre. Welcome is a one-man show that emphasizes the DIY basement-band side to synthesizer funk, that rides hooks and grooves so relentlessly that they transmute from catchy to grating to hypnotic, that draws from Prince and Sly Stone and Beck and Pharrell Williams but amplifies the stuff that made them eccentrics well over the stuff that made them pop. Take Pants' labelmate, the notorious borderline-outsider artist Gary Wilson, replace lounge-jazz with 1980s r&b, remove the thematic obsessions over mystery girls and phrases like ""bitch"" and ""chrome,"" and you've got a start. A damn weird start. Chances are that this album will alienate the shit out of you quite a bit before you start catching on to its fucked-up charm, and you might even give up before you get to that point. There's something kind of obvious and silly about the sounds on this record, particularly the synths, which seem to be chosen specifically for how dated they sound. And few of these songs really get much further than the establishment of a catchy riff and a steady, heavy drumbeat (live or synthesized) with some wailing Moog noises and the odd half-shouted lyric laid over the top. There's actually a fair shot that you'll be horribly repelled by this music, much in the same way and for the same reasons a lot of people seem to have this seething, boiling hatred for ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"" But it's hard to actually consider Welcome a bad album, mostly because it has this inexplicable likability: It's bizarrely comic without coming across as cheap irony, and it's pretty clear Pants lays down these semi-instrumental jams because he wants to have fun and make noise with some once-expensive, now-dated (and, subsequently, currently underheard) musical machinery. It helps when he has someone else along for the ride-- like Deon Davis, who contributes silky-smooth vocals to two of the tracks, including the wobbly Holiday Inn soul harmonies of offbeat debut single ""Ka$h"", or 70s/80s electro-funk obscurity Gary Davis, who co-produces the affably dopey but backbone-slipping ""You're the One"". Yet even on his own, James Pants is capable of laying down some jams when he wants to: for every afterthought-sounding Casio-demo-button-gone-wrong semicomposition like ""My Tree"" or inebriated, rhythmically hinky roller-boogie botch job like ""I Choose You"", there's a song that puts weirdness to its advantage: Opener ""Theme From Paris"" sounds legitimately exciting in its overenthusiasm, all thundering drums and seething synthesizers like a 13-year-old John Bonham pitted against the soundtrack to Sega's arcade classic ""OutRun"", and the damaged on-the-fly rapping of ""We're Through"" has the same low-budget naifish whimsy as some of the better stuff from the similarly Prince-minded indie-electro goofs in Sexual Harassment. I can't unreservedly call this album good-- yet-- but I can definitely recommend that you listen to it, because there's not much out there that really sounds like it, and for every moment where you think its sheer whacked-out sloppiness is going to give you a headache, it delivers a flash or two of giddy brilliance. You know why this gets a 5.0? Because I can't give it a picture of Roger Troutman giving a flying elbow drop to the animatronic gorilla from the Rock-afire Explosion band.","James Pants, the first Stones Throw intern-turned-roster member, creates a willfully odd debut album that, no matter what you ultimately think of it, deserves to be heard.

Voyager,Walter Meego,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b65dc0084474cd0c2598/1:1/w_160/301ec1f5.jpg,2008-06-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11563-voyager/,SonyAlmost Gold,"Within the past month and a half, two songs from Chicago electro-pop duo Walter Meego's full-length debut, Voyager, have appeared on the hit ABC dramedy ""Ugly Betty"". The show's title protagonist is young and unprepossessing, but gains confidence and command as her story unfolds. However unwittingly, Voyager mimics this evolution, initially presenting a pair of facile, derivative popsmiths who seem to perceptibly mature into dynamic artists in the short space between the record's beginning and end. Opening with the Betty-featured ""Forever"", Walter Meego emerges at first as merely an especially blithe practitioner of the kind of affected, heavily beholden synth-pop that's been particularly trendy of late thanks in part to the legitimately great retro stylings of Cut Copy. Faintly cloying where Cut Copy is cool, Walter Meego's initial efforts here are fun but almost obnoxiously lightweight, as the admittedly enjoyable ringing synths of ""Wanna Be a Star"" and cheeseball guitar riffs of ""Girls"" nonetheless edge towards the irritatingly shiny territory of simple-minded labelmate Calvin Harris. Starting with ""Tomorrowland"", however, Walter Meego begins to round into shape, teasing out a distinct Beatles influence (specifically evoking ""Across the Universe"") that subtly but nicely distinguishes the group from some of its more rigorously 1980s-entrenched brethren. That paisley pastiche is followed by the distinctly off-putting ""Keyhole""-- only in the case of Walter Meego ""off-putting"" is a refreshing descriptor given how baldly easy it was to swallow the album's first few tracks. A distant cousin to Radiohead's ""Climbing Up the Walls"", ""Keyhole"" puts hazily distorted vocals, creeping piano, and double-time drums towards obliterating memory of the playskool pop that marked Voyager's first act. The tracks that follow ""Keyhole"" only strengthen the impression that Walter Meego deliberately frontloaded their record with hummable banalities in order to earn the privilege of going darker and deeper over its second half. The fat grooves and layered effects of ""Lost"" suggest the group may have a higher ceiling than ""ideal Hot Chip opening act,"" while the fantastic contrast between precise, hard-hitting beats and pillow-soft vocals on the succeeding ""Letting Go"" makes you disbelieve this could really be the same act that sounded like a lobotomized synth-pop Fountains of Wayne on ""Girls"" just five tracks earlier. Not only is the music suddenly more dense and interesting, but singer Justin Sconza's vocals are noticeably more compelling and commanding as well. Walter Meego has one more quick-change trick up its sleeve, as following the innocuous ""Baby Please"" they close Voyager with a pair of dreamily anaesthetized floaters, a predictable comedown perhaps but an impressive show of pacing and structure from a group that initially threatened to churn out a record of unmediated retro tack. Much as America Ferrera, the bespectacled, braces-burdened star of ""Ugly Betty"", is actually a stone fox in real life, so too does Walter Meego offer up more than you'd first assume.","Chicago electro-poppers, fresh from having two songs featured on ""Ugly Betty"", issue a debut full-length that grows more interesting as it progresses.

In Between Words,Christopher Bissonnette,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b64e9d034d5c69bf51a1/1:1/w_160/31d9a7e0.jpg,2008-06-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11548-in-between-words/,Kranky,"Albums as abstract as Christopher Bissonnette's In Between Words are practically engraved invitations to wax impressionistic, and I admit to filling my notes with unfortunate similes such as ""ascending long-tones stacked like an obsidian ziggurat"" and references to the shadow of something winged and terrible and impossibly immense passing overhead. That images like these could apply to most dark ambient records limits their usefulness, except to say that this album satisfies a fundamental criterion of good abstract music: It lights up the imagination. More specifically, In Between Words is both calming and unsettling, very familiar and very strange, because Bissonnette is essentially turning the familiar Romantic-era music of the 19th and early-20th centuries inside-out. This isn't Bissonnette's innovation-- titans like Morton Feldman paved the way-- yet the effect is especially pronounced on In Between Words. To test this idea, get your hands on a piece of Romantic music: Something dark and gusty and depressive that trembles exhaustedly on the cusp of Modernism will work best. Jean Sibelius' Symphony No. 4 in A Minor is really rad and perfect to illustrate this point. Listen to the string parts for awhile. First, you'll notice the soul-wrenching melodies and the stories they tell. Then, you'll hear the quiet, somnolent rumble all around them. This balance of fluent melody and brooding atmosphere is part of why Romantic music was so good at the 360-view-of-human-experience thing: Like the great Russian novels of the same era, it combined rabid conviction with searing doubt. Its melodies told stories of human striving and collective belief, but its disquieting sub-tones hinted at the existential uncertainty at the fringes of these stories, which would come to dominate Modernism. In Between Words flips the Romantic dichotomy on its head, pulling the sub-tones to the surface and burying the remnants of narrative. ""Provenance"" begins with a desolate expanse of what sounds like stringed resonance with the actual melody edited out, as if someone had stripped away every narrative agent from a Sibelius symphony until only the murky hum at its root remained. When a discernible string melody appears, it's distended, distant, and wracked with electrical interference. Similarly, ""Orffyreus Wheel"" (note the tellingly corrupted mythological reference in the title) finds what sounds like a flanged guitar melody trying to articulate itself through a calm but obliterative gale. ""A Touch of Heartbreak"" sets hollowed-out ghost voices in a blank, seething field, gradually whiting out into hushed static, and ""Tempest"" sounds like a carillon (a shortcut to religious ecstasy in Romantic music) being dragged awkwardly over craggy terrain. The stories these compositions tell are not about mythology, or heroism, or even misery and ruin. In fact, they're not stories at all. Instead, they're elegies for the grand meta-narratives that guided high Romanticism, which were approached skeptically by Modernism and hostilely by Postmodernism. Bissonnette is firmly in the latter camp: Right there in the album's deconstruction-redolent title, he lets us know that he's most interested in what's unsaid. Luckily, he's an eloquent un-sayer, and his music is elevated beyond the cerebral by a palpable longing for a time when meaning wasn't regarded such a chimerical, capricious thing.","Following a path blazed by Morton Feldman, this Canadian composer essentially turns the familiar Romantic-era music of the 19th and early-20th centuries inside-out. This is his second album on Kranky.

The Dream,The Orb,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6513d197565213b0a4/1:1/w_160/b1356d1a.jpg,2008-06-09 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11592-the-dream/,Six DegreesTraffic Inc.,"Let's dream a dream of classic Orb music. What would it include? Long, rangy dub basslines, undoubtedly. Twinkling snatches of suggestive melody, maybe. Certainly a couple of vocal samples, drifting in and out of tracks like happy mental flotsam. And then... the big-lunged diva on top of it all, delivering the group's message of positive empowerment through song? Wait a minute-- something's wrong there. As you wake up suddenly, your early 1990s reverie is shattered by the affectless gospel stylings of that anonymous singer. You fold your tie-dyes away, kick your beanbag into a corner, disconnect your VR goggles, and ask, ""Orb, where did it all go wrong?"" The Orb have presented The Dream as a return to both form and freedom. On the one hand, they cut loose from the deadening expectations of record labels and made it themselves; on the other, they've promised the fans a return to the cosmic roamings of Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld and UFOrb. Dr Alex Paterson is reunited with Youth and Steve Hillage, and longtime collaborator Thomas Fehlmann-- whose commitment to a drier kind of ambience helped lose much of their once-huge fanbase-- is absent. If happy, hippie times were ever coming back, this would be the moment. It isn't, and the out-of-place vocal shenanigans are only part of the reason why. They are a big part, though. On the comical ""Vuja De"", a vocalist shouts ""It's the way you hold me!"" On ""A Beautiful Day"" she informs us ""Sunshine ain't no rain."" On ""The Truth Is..."" we learn ""only truth will set you free."" And so on. The problem isn't really lyrical banality, though, it's that the presence of vocals fixes the songs into a pop structure which works against the band's more diffuse strengths. And the nature of the vocals-- declamatory deep-house singing-- is an unwelcome injection of extroversion into music that's better suited to mind's-eye visions. Even beyond the vocals, the Orb's ability to construct a track seems shot to hell. The group in its heyday made drug music, undeniably, but like the best drug music it didn't just enhance the chemical experience, it explained it for non-users. Orb records prepared a generation of students for what being stoned felt like, largely because they unfolded so enticingly, those gradually shifting basslines underpinning a procession of ideas and samples linked as much by whimsy as logic. The basslines are still here, but where the band might once have fed in one or two edge-of-brain voices and teased out their trippy potential, The Dream is filled with babble. The record samples a heap of stray voices, drawn from sources either hackneyed (radio preachers and politicians) or simply dull (instruction manuals). Even the tracks without singing sound cramped and busy, and the ugly metallic drum sounds the Orb use don't help. Compare these pieces to their Kompakt work and you can't help but suspect that Fehlmann brought useful compositional discipline to the group, even if he did dampen the band's ever-suspect sense of humor. It may seem unfair to constantly hold The Dream up against music the Orb made more than 15 years ago, but that's the yardstick, and the style, the band is clearly aiming for. And towards the end of the record, they do at least locate the target. ""High Noon"" mixes delicate piano fragments with the kind of dub bubblebath that made the group's name, while ""Codes"" lifts sounds from the band's own ""Blue Room"" and works as a nostalgic ramble around some familiar space-scapes. It's all very pleasant, and so is ""Orbisonia""'s closing drift, but even here Paterson's touch with a vocal sample is more wayward and intrusive than it used to be. Ultimately, this particular dream is less one of flight or past glories, and more one of going to work and finding you've forgotten your trousers.","The Orb have presented The Dream as a return to both form and freedom. On the one hand, they cut loose from the deadening expectations of record labels and made it themselves; on the other, they've promised the fans a return to the cosmic roamings of their 1990s peaks.

Evil Urges,My Morning Jacket,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5dea9e61561daa7209/1:1/w_160/043f647e.jpg,2008-06-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11585-evil-urges/,ATO,"In interviews, Jim James has said he doesn't want My Morning Jacket to remain creatively static, or become victim to the sort of bland-ification that befalls so many lesser groups that emerge through the jam and festival circuits. He's lived up to his end of the bargain: A clear and wonderful upward trajectory can be easily mapped over the band's first decade, as their fanbase and creative scope expanded with the crowds and lineups at Bonnaroo, a festival with which they'll forever be linked. As they grew, they pared back indulgences (like the thick song lengths of It Still Moves) and allowed fresh ideas to infiltrate (the first third of Z) while retaining a sonic identity distinctive enough to influence legions of worthy followers. Their 2005 psych/prog wonder Z-- not so much their Yankee Hotel Foxtrot as their The Soft Bulletin-- broke sharply with the Muscle Shoals might of Moves, but 2006's wonderful live double-album Okonokos re-framed and affirmed My Morning Jacket as what fans and critics had been saying since At Dawn: This is one of America's preeminent contemporary rock bands. My Morning Jacket's latest album, Evil Urges, ends the mean streak the band's been on since 2000, and threatens to squander some of the widespread goodwill they've been steadily building along the way. There are few fiery guitar freakouts, folk-influenced melodies, soaring space-rock bridges, or psychedelic flourishes here; instead, the empty space is mostly filled with serviceable falsetto funk and glassy-eyed soft rock. Worse still is the band's decision to ignore the perfect past incarnations of James' Orbisonian tenor-- easily MMJ's most appealing component and one of the more breathtaking instruments in modern rock. At best, his voice is sorely underutilized here; at worst, it's mangled beyond recognition. After listening to Urges, I wonder if My Morning Jacket might just be satisfied following in the footsteps of labelmates Dave Matthews Band: nestling into a comfortable niche and aiming for the Starbucks carousel with rootsy New Age romanticism. Any discussion of this record has to start with the eye-poppingly annoying ""Highly Suspicious"", a loud thud ending any chance Urges had to match the group's previous records. An attempt to merge the band's penchant for live quirkiness with James' long-simmering Prince fixation, the track sounds like My Morning Jacket's version of a Phish novelty. The song reduces James' voice to a grating squeak, which cowers in the presence of the obnoxious, caricatured chorus. Its libertarian undertones (""Wasting all your time on drama/ Could be solving real crime"") sound like they could stretch to resonate with the hydroponic crowd or those who fret about warrantless wiretapping, but I cringe thinking of an entire amphitheatre singing along to ""peanut-butter pudding surprise"" unless they're at a Ween show. At the moment, even a not-very-political band like My Morning Jacket can't resist using their biggest stage yet for a bit of message-driven oratory. James has said, ""Evil Urges is about how all of these things that you've been told are evil really aren't, unless they're actually hurting something or somebody."" Cool, but the title track, a lighter version of ""Suspicious"", neuters a righteous sentiment by burying it underneath a jammy funk pastiche. The simultaneously effortless and calculated ""I'm Amazed"" is breezy and naïve enough to trigger the unconscious sing-along reflex, but the refrain (""Where's the justice?"") is ambiguous. Similarly, ""Look at You"" wastes a perfectly good pedal-steel on a goofy hybrid of the sensual and civic, praising ""a fine citizen"" as ""such a glowing example of peace and glory,"" as if James were a state senator awarding citations to volunteers. ""Sec Walkin'""s refrain of ""demon eyes are watchin' everywhere"" may address his existential angst at omnipresent security, but the song's Quaalude-smooth soul vibe-- for real, it's a Grover Washington sax solo away from the PA system at Von Maur-- make it seem more like he's content to just keep on truckin'. Soft rock isn't an irredeemable genre category, and there are some pretty good singles that have been tagged with it. James and his band have professed their affection for such sensitivity in the past, on tracks like ""I Will Sing You Songs,"" which successfully filtered a timid emotional tone within the band's own style. Not so much here. In a live context, prefaced with an extended ironic monologue, ""Make It With You"" is fun. On record, several times over, from a singer more accustomed to disguising his elliptical, oft-nonsensical lyrics with grain-silos full of reverb, it's incongruous and awkward. ""Thank You Too!"", with syrupy strings courtesy of arranger-to-the-stars David Campbell, is readymade for the bride and groom's slow dance (save the line ""you really brought out the naked part""). The strings trill, dramatically rising and falling on the loner's fantasy ""Librarian"", as James quietly crushes on, and quietly stalks, the female behind the desk, turned on by her listening to ""Karen of the Carpenters"" on AM radio. It sounds like a very well-produced Dan Fogelberg song, until James drops ""interweb"" on us like a sack of dirty socks. Thankfully, there's no couplet about him texting her on his ""Crackberry"" lol. Still, James' tender side also leads to Urges' best moments, which bookend the album. Nicely sequenced after the title track at the start of the record, ""Touch Me I'm Going to Scream, Pt. 1"" is the perfect sequel to Z's sly ""It Beats 4 U"", down to the songs' similarly insistent, live/synthetic drum patter, and the way they isolate James' voice in a chilly emotional purgatory, only to be cracked with passion: ""I need a human by my side, untied"" is vulnerability done right. James is smart enough to know when he's got something good, and he ends Urges with an eight-and-a-half minute dark disco reprise of ""Touch Me"", slowly taking shape as the solemn, steady ""Smokin' From Shootin'"" fades out. With its patient, synthetic gleam slithering around James' lusty hoodoo, ""Touch Me, Pt. 2"" is My Morning Jacket's Moroder moment, bringing a highly frustrating record to a close with the line ""Oh, this feeling is wonderful/ Don't turn it off."" If it hadn't been such an exhausting ride to get there, I might not want to.","My Morning Jacket have refused to remain creatively static, a decision that's helped them map a clear and wonderful upward trajectory over their first decade, but does them few favors on their baffling new album.

Huggable Dust,Okay,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6579d034d5c69bf51b3/1:1/w_160/8d4116e1.jpg,2008-06-06 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11558-huggable-dust/,Absolutely Kosher,"Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be a muse? It has to be a bit weird, right? You could be the reason why someone got over someone, or why people fall in or out of love. You could be an aphrodisiac or heart balm. Your story could define summers and winters. In the case of Okay's Marty Anderson, you might be the reason why he wrote Huggable Dust. Much like High Road and Low Road, the twin debuts Anderson dropped in 2005, Huggable Dust is a shamelessly personal affair that succeeds as much because of Anderson's gift for pop atmospherics as his wide-swinging emotional outpourings. But while its predecessors toyed with questions and trapdoors of a more existential nature, Huggable Dust is focused on that which galvanizes, clouds, and tangles everything in between: love. At 18 songs, there's a lot of sonic acreage to get acquainted with; the album's length cuts both ways, depending on how you feel about Anderson's singing and lyrics. Described in an earlier review by Pitchfork's Stephen M. Deusner as ""insectoid,"" Anderson's voice has a nasal, broken-sparrow quality that can be off-putting at times. But to my ears, it fits these songs well and works with his overall vision. His greatest talent is his ability to take small songs and make them huge, summoning out-of-nowhere climaxes as epic as the doodad-pop flourishes-- Xerox machines, Sega and R2-D2 effects galore-- are numerous. The resulting explosions tend to be both unexpected and breathtaking. ""Panda"", likely a reference to Okay member Amanda Panda, is one of Huggable Dust's best examples. What feels like very much like the plodding but pleasant acoustic pop strokes found throughout transforms to something totally different: an intergalactic mating dance in which Anderson pulls out every stop he can. ""Only"", a fingerpicked lullaby with a chord pattern not unlike Bright Eyes' ""First Day of My Life"", finds Anderson duetting to powerful effect with a female voice that emanates from an answering machine. Huggable Dust definitely seems to suffer from a lack of cohesion, with so many songs pulling in so many different emotional directions that it's difficult to enjoy at once. But when Anderson succeeds-- and he does often-- there's much to love as well. Late in the album, during what is it easily its most bruising ditty, he sings of white flags, of the song's title: truce. Whether or not the muse who might have inspired these songs is still part Anderson's life, she's certainly the lifeblood of the album.","After his twin 2005 debuts High Road and Low Road, singer-songwriter Marty Anderson returns with a chamber-pop album filled with songs about love.

Get Better,Lemuria,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b642b1335d7bf169aa23/1:1/w_160/e3daef8a.jpg,2008-06-06 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11537-get-better/,Asian Man,"We have a lot of fun rappin' with ya here at Pitchfork, but let's get serious for a moment: were the 1990s really that bad? Maybe it's a sign I need to spend less time talking with other music writers, because the consensus appears to be an overwhelming, ""dear fucking god, TOTALLY."" Maybe I'm just naïve, having exited the decade as a teen, but Pinkerton, the NHL 92-96, Higher Learning...we had some good times, right? It's within this context that I fear for Lemuria, even with a promising debut in tow. Because their sales pitch can definitely double as a dealbreaker for some: This sounds just like 1993. The Buffalo foursome may be playing it safe by aligning themselves with the likes of Superchunk and the Weakerthans, but I'm not buying it. If you were old enough to watch MTV and buy CDs, but too young to realize that Belly and the Breeders actually started as spin-off acts, Get Better probably rules. Indeed, Lemuria follow in the path of coy, mixed-sex acts of the alt-rock era, and nowhere is that more clear than in the vocals. Sheena Ozzella and Alex Kerns have an inverse ratio of singing/songwriting, with Ozzella playing the Jenny Lewis role (clearly the lead, sweet and sour demeanor that skirts the ""girly"" tag) while Kerns is more of the Blake Sennett, sporting a slacker deadpan used far more rarely-- good for song-by-song distinctiveness, not so much for harmonizing. Still, you'll be surprised just how fun this can still sound-- ""Pants"" has a rambling melody that recalls ""In a Big Country"" over four DOD fuzz pedal chords. But what comes across from ""Pants"" in particular is that many of these songs feel social and conversational. And none really take themselves too seriously; ""Yesterday's Lunch"" plays around with the line ""it doesn't matter if you've succeeded"" before dropping the Morrissey punchline at the end ""...you'll never feel successful until all your friends fail."" Elsewhere, the subjects are steadfast in their everyday mundanity, things like drunk boyfriends, the girl in the mirror, store clerks. But there's a reason you can go on Amazon.com with $20, buy back all of your Buzz Bin CDs, and still have change-- 75% of the time, you'd forget just about everything that happened from songs 7-10. Get Better loses a lot of its fizz in its second half as the hooks become more indistinct; ""Dog"" and ""Dogs"" apparently are different songs, but the lack of any real segue makes it impossible to tell, and as a whole, they fall into to a spate of sub-two minute blurs that don't establish a welcome they can even wear out. Plus, I'm not sure we're ready for a song built on a thrift store metaphor just yet and while Ozzella is clearly the breadwinner, at times she overdoes it-- to hear her yelp ""I'm missing you MORE THAN I'M KISSING YOU"" is a bit...much. Still, Lemuria have positioned themselves properly with an enjoyable if somewhat inconsistent debut that the world might not be as ready for as they may be in three years or so when they release their sophomore jam during a (probably inevitable) 90s revival. By being slightly behind the times, Lemuria might just be ahead of the game.","Buffalo foursome parties like it's 1993, bringing to mind bands like the Breeders and Belly with songs that feel social and conversational but don't take themselves too seriously.

Worldwide,The Death Set,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b64d9d034d5c69bf519f/1:1/w_160/ff035c17.jpg,2008-06-06 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11547-worldwide/,Ninja TuneCounter,"The fusion of rap and heavy metal in the mid-1980s was as inevitable as it was initially novel, what with the premium both genres place on earthquaking drum beats and aggressive phallocentricism. But somewhere in the journey from ""Rock Box"" to Limp Bizkit, rap was effectively divorced from its true spiritual white-boy cousin-- punk rock, with which it shared roots in the underclass, modest, DIY means of production and a certain outspoken candor. It's a connection that wasn't lost on everybody-- most notably, the young Beastie Boys, but where the Beasties felt it was a prerequisite to drop their guitars in order to pass the mic, some 25 years later, the opening salvo from Baltimore's Death Set proffers another option for another rap-savvy punk-rockers: ""Listen to This Collision"". For Death Set, the collision is not just musical-- hitching revved-up buzzsaw guitars to machine-gunned low-budget beats-- but demographic and, most notably, physical. Upon stumbling into their afternoon South by Southwest set last March, I was greeted with the sight of beardo indie-rock dudes and neon-hatted Spank Rock look-alikes bum-rushing the stage with equal gusto, while Death Setters Johnny Siera and Beau Velasco-- flanked by two drummers-- stood gleefully in the centre of the melee, as stage-diving bodies flew around them like storm debris. That the band are denizens of Dan Deacon's Wham City should come as no surprise, but a Death Set show presents a new utopia: Slam City. Their debut disc, Worldwide, can't match that display for sheer visceral thrills-- its compact, lo-fi production inspires less of a pogo and more of a vigorous head-nod, and with 18 over-caffeinated tracks in 25 minutes, the album feels like a particularly sweet treat that passes through your system far too quickly. But as we approach the impending global oil crisis, the disc's unbridled enthusiasm presents itself as a viable alternative energy source. Worldwide adopts the ghetto-tech machination and chest-pumped posturing of early-80s rap, but-- in the words of a classic ""Mr. Show"" sketch-- without all that rap. Instead, the shout-it-out-loud exhortations of ""Intermission"" and ""Impossible""-- Worldwide's surefire circle-pit instigators-- expose rapid-fire flows and punk-rock sloganeering as products of the same bratty insolence. A great deal of Death Set's charm lies in how their toothsome double-guitar attack is deliberately undermined by their tinkertoy beats and new-waved keys; when the band try to overcompensate with the aggro, like on the robo-hardcore thrasher ""Day in the Wife"", they sound like they've arrived 10 years too late for the Atari Teenage Riot. But Siera and Velasco mostly know that, with their helium-high, munchkin voices, they're not going to fool anyone with a hardcore pose. Like Ween in their infancy, their band is really a vehicle to play out basement rock-star and gangsta fantasies-- Worldwide is littered with cheekily self-aware shout-outs to ""the muthafuckin' Death Set""-- but in their hearts of hearts, they're just a couple of softies: with endearing blitzkrieg-pop confections like ""Had a Bird"" and ""Selective Memories"", Death Set appear no more threatening than a couple of kids on Christmas morning waiting to unwrap the new, all-Superchunk edition of ""Guitar Hero"".","Hitching revved-up buzzsaw guitars to machine-gunned low-budget beats, Baltimore's Death Set-- denizens of Dan Deacon's Wham City-- manage the difficult trick of competently fusing rap and punk rock.

New Amerykah Part One: 4th World War,Erykah Badu,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b65c9d034d5c69bf51b9/1:1/w_160/abee5e54.jpg,2008-06-06 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11562-new-amerykah-part-one-4th-world-war/,Motown,"The American media and public have spent a fair bit of the past months being fascinated and appalled by various remarks from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, of Chicago. Those months have also seen a fairly warm critical reception for Erykah Badu's terrific new album-- one whose notions and ideologies sometimes come from the same nexus as Wright's. Badu's theology is different, of course: more personal, more scattered, less Christian, laced with Five-Percenter notions. And Badu salutes Farrakhan explicitly, rather than just nodding politely across the South Side. But there's an odd echo in her wording on that one: ""I salute you, Farrakhan/ Because you are me."" Less than a month after this record's release, Wright's most notable acquaintance was describing the reverend as someone who ""contains within him the contradictions-- the good and the bad-- of the community.... I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community."" He is me? Until he hits the press club, anyway. New Amerykah is the first in a series of pointedly social records from Badu, and ""you are me""-- or maybe we are we-- could be its motto, or possibly its intended effect. I don't bring up politics for nothing. That attitude, and a lot of the record's concerns, have their roots in the same era that animates Rev. Wright-- those Civil Rights and post-Civil Rights moments when African-Americans were left with some strange, heavy tasks: sorting out how to have a cultural identity as part of a nation that had, up until very recently, been a dedicated adversary, and sorting out how to clean up the wreckage that had accumulated in the meantime. A lot of the critical love for New Amerykah seems rooted in a love for the music of that period-- a time in which popular black artists made records filled not only with visionary, avant-garde sounds, but with a social expansiveness, a fire and ambition to say something important to and for a community. Reviews put this record in a line with those artists: Sly Stone, Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder, Funkadelic; you could tie it even more easily to a lot of smart-guy late-80s hip-hop digging into the same ideas. Nobody who's been paying attention will be surprised at the thought of that mantle being picked up by a woman. This album doesn't just have the personal and social ambitions of those old records-- plenty of charmless ""nu-soul"" records aspire to that-- but some of the sonic ones, too. Big tracks aside, it's an awfully static record, which gives it the kind of high-art ""difficulty"" that we critics have been known to like. The beats, by hip-hop producers like Madlib, 9th Wonder, and Shafiq Husayn, trail sneakily by, leaving Badu-- without the aid of verses, choruses, or much structure at all-- to scribble all over them in her perfect/imperfect voice. (One track, ""My People"", is mostly just a repeated mantra; the rest of Badu's vocal scribbling is buried far back in the mix, like an incidental decoration.) These things should pose problems; one of the chief wonders of New Amerykah is that they don't. Instead, they allow for a sense of intimacy and freedom. At the end of one already-great track, there's an offhand doodle that's one of the most amazing pieces of music I've heard all year: It's just Badu, with some chatter in the background, singing her mother's history in unison with a muted trumpet. But you can hear the two musicians working happily to stay in unison, all through a complex jazz run, even trying to match their vibratos; you can imagine the takes where they miss it and laugh a little. It makes a little joke, and it closes on a terrific line about her mother's resilience-- ""Even though it was hard, you would never ever know it""-- and in the end I can't think of a nobler use for recording equipment. It's those personal moments that sell things, even more so than in Badu's back catalog; credit usually goes to her gift of a voice, which she uses impressionistically instead of composing, but it's always been her keen writing about people that gives her tracks much of their shape. The trumpet comes at the end of a track called ""Me"", which despite the title is more candid than narcissistic-- a gorgeous, sunny, soft-soul beat over which Badu sings about getting older, getting thicker, having two kids with different fathers. That candor is also a lot of what sells Badu's social concerns, which could otherwise sound like a laundry list of black-community struggles: poverty, urban violence, bad policing, AIDS, the psychological hard spot of teenage girls, complacency, and get-mine nihilism versus hope for something else. These things get filtered through Badu's head into real scenery instead of placeholders, and folded in among other things that seem remarkably sincere and personal: mourning for the late producer J Dilla, an earnest belief in hip-hop as a uniting culture, and that we is we attitude. Even the beats wind up feeling earnest. The bulk of them are dark, blunted, woozy, and paranoid; the exceptions are light, breezy, calm. But all of them feel like walking out onto an empty big-city sidewalk in the hours after sunrise, when everything's chilly, dewy, and strange. There are times, as the album drags on, where that static darkness really does become a problem-- where the record begins to seem indulgent, half-finished, or slapped together. Part of the marvel of it, though, is how she still pulls this off, every bit of it, on sheer...Baduizm: Even when she seems wrong, or dippy, or maybe a little batty, she's still a ridiculously compelling and likable personality. This is something no one should criticize in music: recognizable, complex, three-dimensional character. Neither should we be too skeptical about people inclined to laud this as a strong new flash of old-style, socially engaged r&b: Those ambitions are worth praising, and those eras worth looking back on, so long as it doesn't come along with the mean-spirited, bad-faith complaint that ""all"" of today's black music is ""just about guns/sex/money,"" or with this free-floating idea that the experiences of black people must always be treated as a socio-political ""issue"". Badu's difficult and complicated, and not even in a self-absorbed way-- it makes for good, deep records and shows that'll never start on time. (""Time is for white people,"" she recently joked to Blender, one-upping the old line about running on African Time.) I don't know if we're still voting for public policy based on who we'd rather have a beer with, but it occurs to me that I don't know many people who wouldn't love to grab a drink with Badu.","The first in a series of pointedly social records from Erykah Badu, this fascinating, sonically adventurous album finds her exploring a post-Civil Rights landscape in which African-Americans have been left to sort out how to have a cultural identity as part of a nation that had, up until very recently, been a dedicated adversary.

Fleet Foxes,Fleet Foxes,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5f13d197565213b096/1:1/w_160/1327b32c.jpg,2008-06-06 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11587-fleet-foxes/,Sub Pop,"Fleet Foxes may have a firm grasp on rock and folk history, but they never play to their record collection. Rather than revive a particular scene or re-create a lost sound, the Seattle quintet cherrypick their ideas from a broad spectrum of styles, pulling in Appalachian folk, classic rock, AM country, and SoCal pop to create a personal synthesis of the music of their peers, their parents, and even their grandparents. The band didn't leave town to record Fleet Foxes, yet it sounds like it could have been recorded anywhere in the United States-- Austin, Minneapolis, Chicago, Brooklyn, Louisville, or more likely some clearing in the woods. That placelessness constitutes an active effacement, considering that Seattle has been a locus for alternative music for nearly two decades. The five-piece is thoroughly embedded in that scene: Their ranks include current and former members of Crystal Skulls, Pedro the Lion, and Seldom. Furthermore, to produce the sessions that created the Sun Giant EP and this debut LP, they hired Phil Ek, best known for his work with Modest Mouse, Built to Spill, and the Shins. Nevertheless, theirs is a studiously rural aesthetic, eschewing urban influences and using reverb like sepia-tone to suggest something much older and more rustic than it really is. The album opens with a short tune (titled ""Red Squirrel"" on early leaks but not listed on the CD) that could be a field recording sung by a small-town congregation 50 years ago. It ushers us into Fleet Foxes' old world; after a few bars, the song darts into the heraldic ""Sun It Rises"", which sure enough sounds like someone's idea of a sunrise over an evergreen mountain. But they're not done yet: Just as the song fades, it rises into a quiet coda that previews two more elements of their sound-- the patient guitar lick on ""Blue Ridge Mountains"" and the vocal harmonies that color numerous songs on the record. All that's missing are the crackles and hisses of an old LP. (Fortunately, Sub Pop is issuing it on vinyl.) What follows is surprisingly full and wide ranging, almost as much as the Bruegel painting that graces the album's cover. Skye Skjelset's guitar roams wherever it pleases, while drummer Nicholas Peterson keeps the songs in check, allowing the band to move freely but not wander too far into the woods. A flute, half-submerged in the mix, adds lurking menace to the album's most intense jam, ""Your Protector"", and Casey Wescott's staccato piano rhythm runs through ""Blue Ridge Mountains"", heightening the momentum of the chorus. For all the album's winding paths and unexpected vistas, Fleet Foxes' harmonies remain the primary draw, and they've written and arranged these songs to showcase their shared vocals. ""Heard Them Stirring"" has no lyrics, but it's hard to call it an instrumental. Against a shuffling shaker-and-tambourine rhythm, ""Ragged Wood"" switches between Robin Pecknold's lead vocals and the band's harmonies after each verse, effectively translating classic rock via folk elements. There's as much Fleetwood Mac as the Band in the song's rousing finale. On the other hand, Fleet Foxes do restraint just as well: ""Tiger Mountain Peasant Song"" features only a lone acoustic guitar and Pecknold's forceful vocals, which switch to a spooky falsetto on the outro. Vocals play such a primary role in Fleet Foxes' music that Pecknold's lyrics at times sound like merely a delivery system for harmonies, with references to meadowlarks, rising suns, and streams bolstering the rural and placeless evocations. However, these are ultimately carefully and well-crafted compositions. On ""White Winter Hymnal"", a firelit roundelay that best showcases the band's vocal interplay, the lyrics convey strange, almost Edward Gorey-like imagery: ""I was following the pack/ All swallowed in their coats/ With scarves of red tied 'round their throats/ To keep their little heads from falling in the snow/ And I turned 'round and there you go."" Who knows exactly what the words mean, but the fairy-tale menace comes through in full color, and Peterson's floor-tom beat and the intricacy of the band's harmonies dispel the threat without diluting the mystery. Fleet Foxes ends with ""Oliver James"", another nearly a cappella showcase for Pecknold's solo vocals. As he thumps out a soft rhythm on his Martin acoustic, he sings about handmade tables and long-gone grandparents, howling the chorus ""Oliver James, washed in the rain/ No longer."" The brief snippet of ""Red Squirrel"" and ""Sun It Rises"" invites you into Fleet Foxes' debut, but ""Oliver James"" doesn't shoo you out the door. Instead, Fleet Foxes let you linger for a few more bars, leaning forward to catch Pecknold's last syllable as it fades into the air. They don't seem to want the record to end any more than you will.","Following their spectacular Sun Giant EP, Seattle-based Fleet Foxes' full-length debut has a lot to live up to. Luckily, it more than delivers the goods: Incorporating a broad spectrum of styles-- from Appalachian folk and AM country to classic rock and SoCal pop-- Fleet Foxes create a personal synthesis of the music of their peers, their parents, and even their grandparents.

Party Intellectuals,Marc Ribot,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b646b1335d7bf169aa27/1:1/w_160/90145a7a.jpg,2008-06-05 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11541-party-intellectuals/,Pi,"Marc Ribot is tough to put your finger on. He's a left-hander playing guitar right-handed who's turned his natural avant-garde tendencies into a prolific career as a collaborator; to say his music as a solo artist and bandleader is unpredictable is an understatement. He's done everything from straightforward rock to no wave to his own spin on Latin music in between outside gigs, where he's helped re-invent Tom Waits and worked with John Zorn, Elvis Costello, Alison Kraus, Foetus, Wilson Pickett, and Allen Ginsberg, among many others. This latest album (roughly his 19th) finds him in a power trio setting with bassist Shahzad Ismaily and drummer Ches Smith, with a sound somewhere between his freakiest no wave outbursts and his most direct rock output, with a bit more emphasis on the former. Ribot pokes a bit of fun at his own scattershot output on his website, specifying that Ceramic Dog is ""not a project; a real band."" There are traces of funk and ambient music running through the record, and it opens with the most sickly distorted and bastardized cover of the Doors' ""Break on Through"" imaginable-- the original's riff has been forcefully molded into a warped funk-punk groove. It's all done with a certain rambunctious humor that makes it seem pretty natural that the noisescape of ""Digital Handshake"" could sit just two songs from ""Todo el Mundo Es Kitsch"", a song that lives up to its name with wry spoken vocals and a Latin lounge beat. While ""Kitsch"" is charming, though, ""Handshake"" spends five minutes noodling with harsh noise before finally going somewhere, too late to make a difference. Ribot has shown in the past that the line between pushing the envelope and outsmarting yourself can be ambiguous at best, and this track is an example of him crossing that line. Ribot's past dips into Latin rock hybrids are traceable on certain songs, such as standout ""For Malena"", a song with a stripped-back cumbia feel that replaces the usual hand drums with simple clicking and keeps the rhythm reserved. The verses are separated by a cool horn arrangement that sounds vaguely Balkan, and the track come off as similar in tone and construction to some of his best work with Tom Waits. It's amazing the way the band just plows through anything he can cook up for it. ""Malena"" is immediately followed by the ripping Spanish-language dance track ""Pinch"", a punk disco number that leaves lots of room for a hellishly bent guitar solo. I think the best term to describe the record as a whole is ""schizophonic."" Every time you think the band has settled on psychedelic disco or blistering avant-noise, they throw another curve at you. ""When We Were Young and We Were Freaks"" is a barely-there spoken word/ambient/noise piece that reminds me of something Lee Ranaldo might have done on his own in the mid-1990s-- it's compelling in its decrepitude and just about the polar opposite of ""Todo El Mundo Es Kitsch"". The risk of experimentation is failure, and there are parts of this album that just don't work-- see ""Digital Handshake"" and the listless free rock mess of the first half of ""Midost"". As much as its variety sometimes translates to inconsistency, though, Party Intellectuals is a generally interesting listen and could even work as a nice introduction to Ribot's work as a leader for the way it runs so much of his gamut.","Hugely versatile guitarist's new band is a power trio with a sound that lies somewhere in the gulf between his freakiest no wave outbursts and his most direct rock output.

Superabundance,Young Knives,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b61ab1335d7bf169a9e0/1:1/w_160/c4570263.jpg,2008-06-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11502-superabundance/,Ryko,"Young Knives? Wrong kind of cutlery, boys. Try ""double-edged sword."" ""Fit 4 U"" and ""Terra Firma"" are the first and among the finest songs on this platter, built on spiky, lightly distorted guitar, ticking hi-hats, and singer Henry Dartnall's urgent, heavily-accented bark. Problem is, there's a, how you say, Superabundance of bands that can be described the exact same way and to catch up with all of the ones you've tabled for a later date would require locking in yourself in some bunker (preferably an ""angular"" one) until 2010. So how exactly are these guys supposed to battle general scene fatigue as well as second-record expectations when they risk, at best, being a retread and, at worst, being ignored? As their sophomore bow suggests, offer, how you say, a Superabundance of mainland styles, making you all that harder to pin down-- a bit of Blur here (okay, a big chomp of ""Magic America""), some Futureheads there, and top it off with some Arctic Monkeys just to be safe. Comparable bands have toyed with similar tweaks, but what the Young Knives have going for them is a lower profile-- even if it's about the equal of the follow-ups from the Gang of Four gang of four (Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, Futureheads, Maximo Park), it's more likely to be seen as a part of a journey as opposed to an endpoint after a fantastic debut. But as Superabundance grows more diffuse-- by the end, they're crafters of minute-long chamber pop and moony psychedelia-- it still revolves around the eternal maxim of British rock: ""Modern life is rubbish."" It's a decidedly bummer affair, and even though the aggressive tempos suggest they're willing to fight against the crushing weight of existence, there's no relief to be found anywhere in Dartnall's lyrics-- not in material goods, not in your fellow man, and certainly not in romance. As much as Gang of Four's musical influence exerts itself on Superabundance, you could argue that it's the lyrics of ""Anthrax"" that really sold them for Young Knives. If so, it may have informed Dartnall's unfortunate tendency towards overgeneralization: ""Up All Night"" is your garden variety bitterness aimed at the stockyard nightmare of club life, but as Dartnall asks, ""What's the point?"" it sounds sophomorically rhetorical; I mean, people are still having sex and no one can seem to stop them, right? Meanwhile, ""Counters"" feigns suicidal, but it's really more bipolar-- between the dazed harmonies and unhinged caterwauling, it's a heretofore unimaginable hybrid of the Cansecos and Cold War Kids. Judging from ""Turn Tail"", it's empathy that could probably do Young Knives better in the future than consumptive genre-poaching. The emotional and physical centerpiece of Superabundance, it's hardly a ballad, but it retains more heft than most of the miserablist material that surrounds it. ""We are slaves on this ship/ This ship's sinking"" might not be the most sensitive or original commentary, at least until the next line makes it sound exponentially sadder: ""We will not reach the shore."" It's paradoxically the most anthemic moment on Superabundance as well, the light-bulb moment where Young Knives realize their strengths but, most importantly, start to realize the limitations in them.","Nattily-dressed English band that shares the post-punk reverence of Bloc Party and Futureheads returns with its second album.

Thing of the Past,Vetiver,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6449d034d5c69bf518a/1:1/w_160/6b46dd88.jpg,2008-06-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11539-thing-of-the-past/,Gnomonsong,"Covers albums ask you to set aside some of rock crit's most reliable qualitative barometers, songwriting and ""artistic growth,"" for a slightly different set of evaluative tools such as interpretative skill and aesthetic cohesion. But what most fans (and covers albums are primarily for fans) expect from a covers collection is a private tour of a band's basement: its nascent influences, personal touchstones, even its embarrassing fanboy crushes. Vetiver, however, have never obscured their roots. Since the band's 2004 self-titled debut, Andy Cabic and his revolving lineup of players have camped at the various collision sites of rock, folk, psych, and country, combing through almost every inch of that frequently fertile soil. So its more weather than news that the band's latest LP, the accurately named Thing of the Past, digs exclusively in the crate marked ""1967-1973"", culling its covers from the catalogs of artists like Hawkwind, Townes Van Zandt, and Michael Hurley (the last appears on ""Blue Driver""). Anyone hoping Vetiver would pull a Richard Thompson and cover Britney is out of luck. There's very little on Thing of the Past-- released on Cabic and Devendra Banhart co-owned Gnomonsong-- to harsh anyone's mellow. Cabic's balmy tenor is as easy as ever on the ears, and its mild flavor is an actual advantage when called upon to shift from a  supporting role in ""Sleep a Million Years"" to the soft-rock lead in ""To Baby"". Until full-band jam ""Hurry on Sundown"" kicks up some modest dust eight tracks in, Vetiver hold heart rates in check with plenty of mid-tempos, acoustic instrumentation, and tasteful, gold soundz arrangements. The band also keeps interpretive liberties on a leash. Some of the album’s best cuts-- jaunty banjo ditty ""The Swimming Song"" and melancholy wallow ""Road to Ronderlin""-- are potent because they're time-tested, both virtual Xeroxes of, respectively, Loudon Wainwright III and Ian Matthews originals. To his considerable credit, Cabic rescues several obscurities from the dustbin, including the aforementioned ""Sleep a Million Years"". First performed by an un-Googleable Dia Joyce, the dreamy folk tune is resuscitated with a dewy morning-after vocal performance by Vashti Bunyan (someone well-acquainted with musical second acts). ""Lon Chaney"", written by genre-hopping, New York singer-songwriter Garland Jeffreys and performed stately, if a little detached, by Cabic and Papercuts' Jason Quever on piano, is another neat find. ""Lon Chaney"" opens the door to an intriguing point of inquiry, though. Like many artists in the period from which Vetiver draws, Jeffreys wrote political songs informed by passionately held progressive values (in Jeffreys’ case, racial equity). But Vetiver, in breaking their two-year absence with a Vaseline-smeared backward glance, emanates a curiously apolitical, even reactionary, vibe. Make no mistake, Thing of the Past is a perfectly pleasant, well-produced album that offers an authorized version of what Vetiver fans already unofficially know about the band. And if it doesn't make many false steps, it isn't exactly walking a ledge.","This Vetiver covers album not surprisingly digs exclusively in the crate marked ""1967-1973"", culling its tracks from the catalogs of artists like Hawkwind, Townes Van Zandt, and Michael Hurley.

Nah Und Fern,GAS,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb59abf31b7dc7155a81/1:1/w_160/fd76d9ca.jpg,2008-06-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11582-nah-und-fern/,Kompakt,"In 2000, the final album from German producer Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project, Pop, finished in the #12 position in Pitchfork's Top 20 albums of the year. Suffice to say that this website was a much smaller operation then, and there were far fewer writers; collectively, we also only had time for so much experimental electronic music. ""IDM"" as an idea still had plenty of currency, but many of the records falling under that banner were specialty items, something one would put on in a very specific time and place. And there were lots of them. In this landscape, when experimental electronic music was going in a hundred different directions at once-- considering only Gas' label, the Frankfurt imprint Mille Plateaux, you had the jagged sound of disrupted technology in Oval, the boldly politicized field recordings of Ultra Red, the filmic breakcore of Alec Empire, along with a smattering of post-rock and industrial-- Gas was something we could all agree on. Wide appeal-- even amongst upstart music critics-- isn't something one would expect from this project. When working as Gas in the second half of the 1990s, Voigt's tracks usually featured an unflinching kick-drum pulsing at a mid-tempo BPM-- sometimes ping-ponging across the soundfield or encrusted with burrs of syncopation-- and they typically featured samples of stern and ominous Western classical music. The string and horn drones were sourced from vinyl and proud of it, with the corresponding pops and crackles figuring prominently in the mix. The Gas sound, so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, seemed somewhat monochrome and tightly focused at the time. It was easy to come away with the idea that the project was an exercise in Fall-like consistency-- ""Always different, always the same,"" as John Peel said about the latter. But it's clear now that each record was its own discrete chamber in Voigt's overall construction. The evidence is here, on this 4xCD box set, which collects the albums proper-- 1996's self-titled record, 1997's Zauberberg, 1999's Königsforst, and 2000's Pop (missing is the 1995 Modern EP as well as a couple of stray tracks)-- into a single set. These records have been out of print for years-- I saw a copy of Zauberberg going for $270 on Amazon not long ago-- but those refusing to pay outlandish prices have been handsomely rewarded. Gas in many ways sounds even more wondrous now, and certainly more wide-ranging. The self-titled debut, originally released in 1996, is perhaps the most beautiful entry in the catalog. The rich, shimmery drones seem less earth-bound and heavy relative to what would come later; rather than evoking a dense, mossy arboreal feel-- Voigt has frequently acknowledged the sights and sounds of Germany's Black Forest as an inspiration-- Gas brings to mind images of a clear night sky, as pin-pricks of twinkling guitar samples, trails of distortion that swirl like a starry cloud dispersing into the void, and the bassy string tones all meet in a vast open space designed for contemplation. Though Gas is in some ways the most conventional of the project's records, with moments easily relatable to trends in post-acid house ambient, it also marks Voigt as a producer with a rare ear for texture. The following year's Zauberberg was the solidification of quintessential Gas aesthetic. While overall the darkest and bleakest of these offerings, Zauberberg opens and closes with the deeply spiritual and uplifting organ drones one can imagine leaking from the cracked stained glass windows of a massive cathedral somewhere in the Bavarian Alps. Sandwiched between these drifting moments of blissful surrender are grim meditations on the physicality of tension. The bass drum throbs between the speakers, less a heartbeat than the icy, unremitting march of time, while Voigt's most dissonant string samples tug everything down into the black soil. It's a shopworn observation among Gas observers to say that the music on the individual albums closely mirrors the images record covers, but Zauberberg is as dark and menacing as the noir picture of red branches in darkness featured on its front. Beginning precisely where Zauberberg leaves off, with rumbling strings and an unblinking kick, Königsforst eventually takes things to a far more complicated place. Where Gas had previously been defined by the sense of endlessness-- insistent repetition, lengthy tracks that could conceivably go on forever, a consistent mood-- Königsforst experiments with development, moving through timbres and emotional sensations with a definable dramatic arc. The album looks back and forward simultaneously as Voigt seems to be probing the limits of what the project could be. The same starry backward guitar bit that first appeared on the third track of the debut returns on the fourth track here, now yoked to a subtle double-time kick-drum that gives a sense of blood-rushing excitement. Then the album culminates in the 15-minute fifth track, an Escher-like climb through samples of orchestral horns that change almost imperceptibly with each passing bar, moving from a firm, almost militaristic growl to welcoming, optimistic swoon by the track's end. The beatless drone that closes is another masterpiece, one that hints at massive left-turn to come on 2000's Pop; Königsforst on its own is essentially perfect. Pop is the best known and most admired of these discs, and it provides an obvious entry point. Which is somewhat ironic, since it's also the most divergent by a huge margin. Had it come out under another name, it would have been difficult to know that this was a Gas record at all. The first three tracks offer three subtly different views of the same sound-field, a warm, wet place populated with bubbles, fizz, and hisses, along with keyboard drones and the sort of basslines Angelo Badalamenti used in ""Twin Peaks"" to suggest a rural idyll whose dark secrets were yet to be revealed. Had the record continued to explore this one direction, it might have been understood as a contemporary variation on the new age meditation record, something listeners would return to in order to chill out and ""center"" and so on. But Voigt had something else in mind. By the fourth track he's returned the steady kick to the mix, and braided the percussion with a clanging repetitive bell that one imagines the Field's Axel Willner found inspiring. As the beats disappear for two tracks the album inflates with anxiety and dread until, with the return for the 15-minute closer, we're immersed in one of the most nervous-- bordering on malicious-- Gas tracks of all. By this point, it seems, Voigt had said what he wanted to say with Gas and was ready to move onto something else, like helping to turn the Kompakt label he runs with Michael Mayer and Jürgen Paape into one of electronic music's premier imprints. Four Gas albums in five years turned out to be quite a lot to chew on; this phase of his career is comparable to Brian Eno's instrumental music between, say, his 1973 collaboration with Robert Fripp, No Pussyfooting, and 1978's Music for Airports. More than anyone since Eno with the exception of Aphex Twin, Wolfgang Voigt was able to reimagine how ambient music could transform space. But he did so in a grounded, accessible manner. There's something primal and intuitive about this stuff; as heady electronic music goes, it's like a loaf of hearty dark bread, an easy-to-grasp but deceptively intricate musical world with a strong sense of-- to stretch the metaphor-- nourishment. Wolfgang Voigt's musical interests have led him to create stark dancefloor minimalism, playful house, and trance-inducing dub-techno; but Gas was the name he gave to music that was foremost about immersive space. This is music you can lose yourself in; see you in four or five hours.","This 4xCD box set collects the four albums that Wolfgang Voigt has created under his Gas moniker-- 1996's self-titled record, 1997's Zauberberg, 1998's Königsforst, and 2000's Pop-- and collectively they represent a wondrous high point in the history of electronic music.

The Best Of / The Best Of [Special Edition],Radiohead,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6313d197565213b09e/1:1/w_160/57ef1047.jpg,2008-06-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11686-the-best-ofthe-best-of-special-edition/,Capitol,"The week after Radiohead's OK Computer was released in the U.S., it debuted in the album charts at #21; bowing at #1 was the Prodigy's The Fat of the Land. In the U.S., the Prodigy were heralded as the bellwethers for electronica, while, in the face of this newly cobbled-together marketing schematic-- and exponentially rising sales of country and hip-hop-- Radiohead were charged by some with the task of ""saving"" rock music. Oddly, the two records seemed to have opposite effects. Throughout the late 1990s and early 00s, Thom Yorke practically functioned as a Warp publicist, embracing the possibilities and future of electronic music but retaining the charisma, scope, and grandeur of pop and, in the process, helping to expose rock fans to electronic textures and sounds. Meanwhile, the Prodigy-- along with Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, and Korn-- inadvertently spawned the well-selling mook rock. Four years later, Radiohead had pushed too far in the ""wrong"" direction: The band's next two albums-- Kid A and Amnesiac-- strayed far left of the organic and ""authentic"" (read: instruments carved from wood) for many of those same people who had exalted the group the previous decade. Critics faced with having to either step outside of their historical comfort zones and recalibrate their sensibilities or retreat back to the familiar took the easy road and embraced a New Rock Revolution that, in the U.S., never came to fruition. In the wake of it all, Radiohead themselves retreated from the spotlight, becoming the sort of arena-sized DIY band that, oddly, Pearl Jam morphed into during the previous decade, and eventually leaving their record label, Capitol, altogether. Capitol's eventual response is, quite naturally, to collect the group's older material in a more pocket-sized package. To its credit, the label is going all-out with these releases, offering not only two different CD or digital versions of the set (a 17-track single disc or a 30-track 2xCD package), but also a 4xLP vinyl version that could be a nice addition to a fan's collection and pretty kickass DVD that even casual observers should love. Make no mistake then, the middling and low scores up there don't reflect a general dissatisfaction with the notion of carving up Radiohead's albums (though both the flow of Kid A and the tension of Amnesiac are masterstrokes of pacing), the very idea of career-spanning compilations, or even these records being compiled without the band's participation-- for one thing, avoiding the DVD on those grounds would be foolish. (And to be fair to Capitol, the label always seemed highly supportive of Radiohead, investing plenty of resources and marketing into their records-- especially OK Computer and Kid A.) No, it's much more utilitarian than that: Namely, for whom are these records meant? The question is easier to answer for the single-disc version, which functions as a Radiohead sampler. A crisp, 17-track collection, it features the band's most well-liked singles, plus Kid A tracks ""Idioteque"", ""Everything in Its Right Place"", and ""Optimistic"" (remember, there were no singles pulled from that LP), plus the title track to The Bends. All told it's a murderer's row-- ""Paranoid Android"", ""Lucky"", ""Pyramid Song"", ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"", ""No Surprises"", ""Creep"", the aforementioned Kid A tracks, and many more. Only the sleepy ""High and Dry"" and requisite Hail to the Thief representative ""2+2=5"" are relative duds. If you've turned away from Radiohead this decade or if you aren't hooked by the more abstract pieces they've made since OK Computer, it's a good way to catch up. The tracks themselves are a 10, and if you're actually curious but unfamiliar with the group, by all means buy it. Yet even saying that, this isn't a band with a winding, difficult discography to navigate, and 10 of these 17 tracks are from The Bends and OK Computer. Assuming CDs exist in the near future, I suspect this compilation will become more useful in years to come, when younger listeners who haven't engaged with Radiohead throughout most of the group's lifetime want a place to sort out what the fuss is about. For the rest of us, it's just not needed. The 2xCD version, although a better value-for-money, does even less to justify its existence. Starting rather cleverly with ""Airbag"" and ""I Might Be Wrong"", aka the two lead tracks from Capitol's in-print Radiohead mini-LPs (hint, hint), it goes on to add another seven tracks from the 1995-2003 albums (great songs, but most of them weaker than the ones on CD1), a pair of clunkers from 1993 debut Pablo Honey, and the only two things here that come close to being rare: The B-side ""Talk Show Host"" and the live acoustic solo Thom Yorke version of ""True Love Waits"" from the previously hinted-at I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings-- the only other time that song has appeared on record in any form. The packaging is merely a few promo photos and a long essay I didn't read (sorry). With little rhyme or reason to the songs that fill out this second disc, it becomes even more disappointing that a bonus isn't given over to an alternate view of the group-- B-sides or rarities, a collection which would be of great use, or their more adventurous work. Instead, this compilation is dominated by a pair of central ideas of what Radiohead sound like: emotionally nourishing, impressionistic balladeers, or crunchy, tech- and texture-savvy rockers. The outliers, moments when the band has dabbled more in mood, atmosphere, or a love of pure sound-- think ""Kid A"", ""Climbing Up the Walls"", or exquisite Amnesiac tracks like the clanging ""Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box"", the prescient paranoia of ""Life in a Glasshouse"", the unsettlingly gorgeous ""Like Spinning Plates"", or the punchdrunk ""You and Whose Army?""-- aren't represented at all. (Weirdly, I don't miss anything from Hail to the Thief, a collection of songs that works better live than on record.) So, sure, artistically this could be a much stronger 2xCD set, but it's rightfully in Capitol's interest to spread the love and highlight all of the band's releases, each of which the label has a monetary stake in promoting. The latest Radiohead album, In Rainbows, is of course not one of them. Radiohead's decision to first self-release that record was heralded as an early warning sign that the major-label system was faltering. In truth, it's more of a late sign: With so little creative energy engaged in the hope and promise of making grand, heroic rock music-- and so few reliable, national delivery systems for it now that MTV and radio have become increasingly marginal-- the guitar set is still, incredibly, mostly left with warmed-over sounds from the 90s (on modern rock radio) or earlier (everyone else). It's no wonder that New Rock Revolution, itself mostly revivalism, had so many ardent cheerleaders. Radiohead's purposeful retreat from the spotlight-- leaving Capitol Records; the patronage-like, ""we leak, you pay"" pricing policy that accompanied the announcement of In Rainbows-- returned them briefly to the headlines but did little to place their actual music in the public consciousness on any grand, communicative scale. (""Bodysnatchers"" was a semi-hit on modern rock radio.) Less than a decade after Radiohead invigorated critics and many listeners by becoming one of the few contemporary bands willing to both strive to reach a mass audience and cast its eyes to the corners and cracks of the pop landscape, they had become another niche group in a world full of them. What's more, the mechanics and poor health of the music industry-- with Radiohead, Trent Reznor, and others now experimenting with communicating directly to the faithful rather than to any and all potential listeners-- mean we may never see another platinum-selling rock group like this again. It's no surprise then that the music industry's response is to repackage and recycle, as quickly as possible.","The inevitable Radiohead ""best of"" comes as either a 17-track single disc or a 30-track 2xCD package-- and both are heavy on material from the 1990s.

Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow,Hammock,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b618b1335d7bf169a9da/1:1/w_160/5c1503f4.jpg,2008-06-04 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11500-maybe-they-will-sing-for-us-tomorrow/,Darla,"Have you ever just listened to the sound of your own breathing? Listening to Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow is a little like that. It's also a little like watching clouds drift overhead in layers, scudding cumulus puffs nearby and stretched-out, nearly motionless cirrus high above. It's a little like whale songs, or the gauziest, most slow-motion part of a Sigur Rós song, pulled out over an hour. Imagine if an audio tape, unraveled and stretched out in the breeze, could capture the sound of its own undulations. That's what Hammock sound like. Lazily, it's drone music, and it plays by its own rules. An event in pop music is the verse going to the chorus, or the double-stop, or the re-introduction of a riff. An event in this music is one note changing to another, or two notes colliding to make a new vibration, or a slow swell in volume that leads to a tiny moment where you can perceive the difference in timbre between the guitar and the keyboard. Andrew Thompson and Marc Byrd check their egos at the door when they record this stuff and simply allow the sounds they generate to meld with one another in an ultra slow-motion dance. Their last album, 2006's Raising Your Voice...Trying to Stop an Echo, offered a few vocal tracks and a bit of percussion to ground its explorations, but this one is a lot more elemental and simple. It's also an immersive listen if played at the right volume and paid the right amount of attention. Short of that, it works well as ambient music, not so much filling the room with sound as merging with the very air in the room. I swear it practically changes the temperature. Speaking relatively, the most active track is ""Mono No Aware"", which takes its title from a Japanese phrase that roughly means ""the sadness of things."" It opens with a bit of back-masking and drifts through a passages of ethereal guitar, before finally bringing in a solemn cello line. Tonally, it's a calmer, more Zen cousin of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. It's also hard to recommend wholeheartedly-- some people simply won't be able to get to music this placid, and that's fine. If you have any kind of even passing affinity for atmospheric music with an uncanny ability to stimulate any of your five senses, though, hear this.","Imagine if an audio tape, unraveled and stretched out in the breeze, could capture the sound of its own undulations.

12 Angry Months,Local H,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6419d034d5c69bf5180/1:1/w_160/2419a096.jpg,2008-06-04 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11536-12-angry-months/,Shout! Factory,"If it weren't for heartbreak, breakups, and other broken things, there would be a lot less pop music. Not that heartbreak is a particularly popular thing, but there's always been plenty of it to go around. It's universal, linking the most modest home-recorded navel gazing to the most bombastic and over-produced of top 40 fodder. As the J. Geils Band put, ""love stinks."" Yeah yeah. So Local H's 12 Angry Months is hardly the first breakup album, but it's likely one of the few explicitly conceived as such. Following what one imagines was an especially bitter, painful dumping, Lucas wrote a song for each month of the aftermath. By his own account, he wanted to push the usual woe-is-me motif to the limits, baring his soul while stripping his target down to the bone. But Lucas' bad time is our good time, as he remains one of the few songwriters up to all the Cheap Trick comparisons. After all, Cheap Trick were ultimately more power than pop (at least until they actually went pop), and since their grunge-era breakthrough Local H has kept their muscles toned and flexed. For what is in essence the ultimate expression of inadequacy, self-loathing, failure, and impotence, 12 Angry Months is a tough little thing. Whatever girl broke Lucas' heart clearly did at least enough harm to last a calendar year, and Lucas is fighting back. ""Yeah, I hope you have a lonely life"" he sings in the snarling ""White Belt Boys"", a Greg Dulli-worthy rave-up that correlates to April and follows March's equally unforgiving offering ""BMW Man"" (""this is crazy, I can't believe that you replaced me,"" Lucas sings of his fancy car driving, probably Republican romantic substitute). ""The Summer of Boats"", a rousing power ballad, begins with a touch of forgiveness, but by ""Taxi-Cabs"" Lucas is back to vengeful again. No one said you can't be angry and catchy, though, and ""24 Hour Break-Up Session"" does both with aplomb, like a more literal-minded Nirvana. ""Jesus Christ! Did You See The Size of the Sperm Whale?"" may be a little in-jokey, but it's not hard to catch the gist of Lucas' vitriol as he catches up with his ex. ""I'm thinking he can have you,"" he snarls. ""You're just a groupie...to think I used to fuck you."" Ouch. No wonder another power-ballad, ""Simple Pleas"", comes next. ""I can't let go,"" Lucas wails in that one. No kidding. By the end, the nearly 10-minute ""Hand to Mouth"", Lucas and his former better half have reached some semblance of cease fire (at least in his head), but the damage has already been done. He's already recounted splitting up his record collection in ""The One With 'Kid'"" and a failed attempt at reconciliation in ""Machine Shed Wrestling"" (""as a product you would be great...as a lover, you're just a bust,"" he zings). What's left is exorcising demons. That surely won't get the girl back, especially after the scorched earth approach of 12 Angry Months, but at least Lucas got a good record out of the ordeal.","Scott Lucas looks back at a year of romantic misery with shocking candor.

"Come, Arrow, Come!",Festival,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b63f9d034d5c69bf517c/1:1/w_160/1f549ea5.jpg,2008-06-04 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11535-come-arrow-come/,Language of Stone,"Preciousness seems particularly well-embedded in the consciousness of the practitioners of the New Weird Americana. The crumbled monolith of the Elephant 6 collective still keeps its watchful eye trained on the utopic pop of the Beach Boys; the more traditional freak-folks idolize the psychedelic UK folk movement, which itself espoused Renaissance tradition. Enter Alexis and Lindsay Powell, sibling masterminds of Festival, who implore visitors to their website to ""make fun with these ladies of the forest night,"" pining (no pun intended) for the creature comforts (no pun intended) of an existence quite impossible in their Brooklyn surroundings. Festival's debut album, Come, Arrow, Come! extols the virtues of campfire sing-alongs and epic loves, recklessly twined together with the strands of the girls' sinewy voices. (Pitchfork contributor Mike Powell is a member of Festival, though he does not appear on this album.) You can easily tell the difference between the sisters. Lindsay opens the leadoff cut ""Fair and True"" with plain, insistent resolve-- ""O the earth has dirtied this lonesome heart""-- and is joined by the trained vibrato of Alexis for the end of the couplet ""And the wind has brought it to you."" As the girls take turns spinning yarns of ageless love, their friends and family join in an unaccompanied chorus, with only spare percussion as counterpoint to an upward-reaching hymn of solemn sincerity. The acoustic guitar only sometimes communicates the songs' progressions, though the girls clearly find inspiration in six-string tradition. In its place, sleigh-bells and creaky pianos gossip a millennium's worth of backwoods musics: the kind of interstitial mantras that echo from the coffeehouse, the church gathering, the picnic, the old-time dance hall, the wild wood. While this project might belong with the freak-folk revivalists who fetishize Woody Guthrie and the acidic tinges of British folk, Come, Arrow, Come! gets at an elemental simplicity. Renaissance-influenced ballads appear next to songs best suited for a hootenanny. ""Zebulon"" recalls Druidic chants, then the percussive pulse of ""Bind Us All"" follows. The greatest unifying characteristic is the two voices, which swell and bend around each other with a fluency only achieved via familial relation. Simpler than their acerbic cousins Espers, Festival champion aching directness. They're not messianic drum-circle leaders like Devendra Banhart or adherents to substance-induced drone patterns like Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny. In the truest sense of tradition, Lindsay and Alexis pick the low-hanging fruit of acoustic instrumentation as a means to communicate the poetic imagination of a balladic history through their voices. True to their online mission statement, this creative pair isn't celebrating Ameri-Anglo tradition so much as imploring their fellow youth to conceive of a simpler, younger, better time. Considering the predicament of the Informationesque, Nine-Elevenish, Bush Economy world, you'd best appreciate such romantic notions.","Alexis and Lindsay Powell, sibling masterminds of Brooklyn folk outfit Festival, implore listeners to ""make fun with these ladies of the forest night.""

Watershed,Opeth,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b66a9d034d5c69bf51d0/1:1/w_160/01d2941e.jpg,2008-06-04 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11575-watershed/,Roadrunner,"Not all prog is created equal. Take prog metal, for instance. In one corner are Mastodon, who are prog to the core: long songs, lots of noodling, worship of 1970s Genesis (at least on the part of drummer Brann Dailor, an avowed Phil Collins acolyte). In the other corner are Dream Theater, who are equally prog: long songs, lots of noodling, worship of 1970s Rush (at least on the part of drummer Mike Portnoy, an avowed Neil Peart acolyte). Hipsters love Mastodon, but they won't go near Dream Theater. Dream Theater fans are equally unlikely to sport Mastodon t-shirts. Perhaps this split is due to friction (in the musical sense). Mastodon are closer to prog as it was in the 70s-- self-indulgent, yes, but also earthy and analog. Dream Theater are the apex of prog's, um, progression since then. They're digitally clean and hyper-precise, poster boys for Pro Tools. For whatever reason, the white belt set gravitates towards prog's older aesthetic (see also the Mars Volta), while men with ponytails discuss kick drum pedals in Dream Theater forums. If ""indie"" is an aesthetic, it stops at certain thresholds of precision and heaviness. Opeth, interestingly, have straddled both prog aesthetics. The Swedish band's first record, 1995's Orchid, was wonderfully raw. It was half death metal and half ""other stuff""-- folk, prog, blues, jazz. The rawness came from a low budget and nascent songwriting, but it conveyed an atmosphere that Opeth never regained. Their records afterwards decreased in friction as their chops improved. In 2002, the band became practically frictionless. It split its heavy and light sides into two records, Deliverance and Damnation; the latter was gorgeously intimate. 2005's Ghost Reveries likewise went down smoothly, like a rich hot chocolate. Watershed is an intriguing exercise in discontinuity. Unlike Orchid, which was jagged because the band didn't know how to do otherwise, Watershed finds Opeth willfully flying their freak flag. An acoustic intro with pleasant male/female singing leads straight into barreling death metal. A piano wanders into ""Hessian Peel"" apropos of nothing. ""Burden"" has an acoustic outro in which one guitarist detunes the other's pegs. It's delightfully horrible-sounding; such goofiness is refreshing for a band that's almost offensively virtuosic. ""The Lotus Eater"" offers the greatest jolts. An intro of quiet humming drops into what seems like the middle of a death metal song-- but with disarmingly sunny vocal harmonies. Three minutes in, dissonant guitar lines spiral downwards like DNA strands. Later, a downright funky vamp appears, complete with chattering clavinet, as if Stevie Wonder had dropped by the studio. Aiding such absurdity are Opeth's two new members. Fredrik Åkesson brings lead guitar flash to a band that's prided itself on restraint, while drummer Martin Axenrot swings with verve. (Near ""Hessian Peel""'s end is a monstrous groove that's like Meshuggah dancing a jig.) Despite these hijinks, Watershed won't convert Mastodon fans en masse. It still has too many renaissance faire moments; its death metal is as aggressive as ever. After 18 years, Opeth's trademarks are well-established-- sinuous riffs, retro 70s keyboards, Mikael Åkerfeldt's Jekyll/Hyde act of death growls and mellifluous singing. (He sounds like your lovable Swedish uncle who once recorded a folk album.) But Watershed has friction, and friction brings heat. Those left cold by metal's po-faced tendencies might well warm up to it.","Swedish prog-metal greats unexpectedly fly their freak flag on their ninth full-length.

Rook,Shearwater,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b659ea9e61561daa6f6a/1:1/w_160/4c3911f5.jpg,2008-06-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11560-rook/,Matador,"Since last year's partially re-recorded and re-released Palo Santo, Shearwater have gone out of their way to assert themselves as more than just an Okkervil River side project or one man's solo recordings, but a living, breathing full band. Rook, however, is their first album-length test, one that reaches deeper into their influences and flexes muscles no one knew they had. Singer and principal songwriter Jonathan Meiburg's voice is just one instrument among many that color these ten tracks, which, in one way, is disappointing, as Meiburg is a stunningly expressive singer who could easily carry a record by himself (see: either edition of Palo Santo). Regardless, they're blessed with engineers who sweat and toil over every incidental noise, guests on everything from clarinet to harp, and a drummer named fucking Thor-- all of whom assert themselves on Rook. This is good news for any listener, but perhaps especially for those who favor the more sensitive and baroque strains of indie rock, yet are tired of hearing it soundtrack every stray minute of public radio or primetime TV: Shearwater give ""pretty"" indie a good name. From its hushed start to the crunch and swing of its chorus, ""On the Death of the Waters"" is a dramatic opener that announces how much clatter Shearwater 2.0 can make. First single ""Rooks"" is far more ordered and composed, but the attention paid to its craft is discernible, from Meiburg's more controlled vocal performance to the nimble guitar plucking and insistent half-note throb of bass. ""Leviathan, Bound"" is the first hint at how far the band has stretched its palette, incorporating plenty of strings, glockenspiel, and glassy, mysterious percussion, with Meiburg finally letting out a more immediate howl as the song's simple melody gathers steam. Thor Harris' contributions to the record on percussion are more subtle than his name would imply, but his performances always elevate the song, whether it's the buttoned-up accompaniment of ""Rooks"" to the determined gallop of ""Home Life"", saving its seven woodwind-and-string-laden minutes from sagging. While he serves at the anchor to some tracks, he adds the most vivid touch to the already dramatic bridge of ""Lost Boys"" with a formal military march during its bridge. A necessary jolt on a well-paced album, Shearwater's attempt to let their collective hair down on the guitar-driven ""Century Eyes"" comes off as forced next to all these cautious and mannered arrangements. They've lost no momentum, however, when they reach the steady rumble of ""The Snow Leopard"", which comes later on the record. It begins with conspicuous unaccompanied piano chords before slow, elemental drums and low single notes of guitar trudge forward, driving the song with the same woozy melodic force of previous Shearwater highlights like ""White Waves"". The influence of Talk Talk's later records is even more apparent here than on their earlier work, notably in Meiburg's voice as he leans more on his falsetto and exercises restraint. It's also in the instrumentation, which tends towards the drifting and heavily atmospheric. Meiburg's more than capable of hanging with Mark Hollis vocally, and this approach drives the band to considerably expand its sound. Shearwater have not only broken new ground for themselves, but added a welcome sense of variety from track to track on Rook, all in a concise 35 minutes that feels more like a double album in scope. Hollis acolytes or not, these are hardly song-sketches; all of them are careful compositions adding new instruments, moods, and sounds around the anchor of Meiburg's voice. The edges of these otherwise lulling, hypnotic songs hint at danger and chaos, but only the brief feedback excursion of ""South Col"" pokes a hole in the album's fabric and hints at what more avant-garde threads the band might be capable of following. As impressive and uniformly gorgeous a record as Rook is, the band's best work is likely still to come.","Much more than one man's solo recordings or an Okkervil River side project, Jonathan Meiburg's Shearwater follow last year's partially re-recorded and re-released Palo Santo with their first LP of new tunes for Matador.

Wild Animals,The Pinker Tones,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6379d034d5c69bf516d/1:1/w_160/91a752d2.jpg,2008-06-03 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11527-wild-animals/,Nacional,"Should an alien race ever need a one-stop primer on the global diversity of the past few decades' pop music, Barcelona's the Pinker Tones ought to be able to keep them from laying waste to our major population centers for a night or two. The pseudonymous duo of Mister Furia and Professor Manso put something for every euro-waving reveler on their 2006 stateside debut, The Million Colour Revolution, dabbling in lounge, bossa nova, funk, and enough other genres to keep up with their Spanish, English, French, and German lyrics. Prodded along by dance beats, the album also hearkened back to the 1990s' internationalist indie pop of groups like Pizzicato Five and Cibo Matto. Wild Animals, which follows last year's More Colours! remix LP, plays around in the same pluralistic pool. Although its stylistic breadth still dizzies, the ideas have started to sound a little shallow. There's Daft Punk electro-kitsch here, woozy Air luxuriance over there, and plenty of Beta Band-esque harmonies all around, but the allusions are rarely as satisfying as the hypothetical record collection they represent. At a time when U.S. music listeners are already enjoying a particularly diverse assortment of global sounds-- from Bollywood to the Balkans, Kunduru to chanson, Afropop to gamelan, by American artists and international ones-- an album can't get by on its border-crossing eclecticism alone. Wild Animals is a party in international waters; what it lacks is an occasion. Not that Furia and Manso have lost their high, supple voices or jingle-ready melodies. With a squishily funky bass line, opener ""Hold On"" winds up sounding like a self-help Beck-- ""Hold on to your dreams, 'cause it's a long way home,"" the singers repeat-- but not until after a choir-like intro that's the best homage to Brian Wilson's SMiLE opener ""Our Prayer"" since the Earlies did one back in 2004. ""S.E.X.Y. R.O.B.O.T."", meanwhile, is silly electro-house fun that soon wears out its welcome-- good luck getting that vocoder-like spelling lesson out of your head, though. The Pinker Tones do best when they set their globe-pillaging ideas to more fully-fledged songs, as on first single ""Happy Everywhere"", a scrambled acoustic-pop song with squelching synths, Mancini-esque strings, cowbell, and a chorus that's at once cheerful and a bit paranoid. The wordless ""Fugaz"" is thwomping blog-house, ready for its Modular signing; another standout, ""24"", confronts a quarter-life crisis with a horns-blasting chorus. The Pinker Tones' pan-genre versatility and fearless pursuit of fun could've made them a Spanish Super Furry Animals, but a few of these songs could do with a bit more super (possibly fur, too). ""Biorganised""-- with some burbling bass, translucent acoustic guitar, and a harmonica solo-- follows the Moon Safari template too closely for its own good. ""Working Bees"" is tuneful, falsetto-led space-funk that likens the band to bees ""making honey for your ears."" Oh, and ""The Whistling Song"" is four minutes of ska about whistling. The Pinker Tones already tried much of this stuff more successfully on their last proper LP; as refreshing as it still is to hear a group so unconstrained by a single sound, the songs on Wild Animals can't quite fill the wider world their style envisions. I for one welcome our new alien overlords.","The Spanish band's pan-genre versatility and fearless pursuit of fun is reminiscent of Super Furry Animals or the 1990s' internationalist indie pop of groups like Pizzicato Five and Cibo Matto.

The Acrobats,Helvetia,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b63513d197565213adc4/1:1/w_160/a5f6a255.jpg,2008-06-03 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11526-the-acrobats/,Static Cult,"Not much changes in the space station Jason Albertini and Canaan Dove Amber call home. After a decade of producing celestial music unperturbed by outside stimuli, the duo's heavenly stare remains unwavering, their minds still blown by how, like, huge the universe is, man. But while their former band Duster felt content to drift through the universe in near suspended animation, Albertini and Amber are willing to make spin-off project Helvetia sweat for its cosmic bliss. Their 2006 debut The Clever North Wind barely had a pulse, but the uneasy psych leanings and dark moods made the album anything but a stroll through the galaxy. Building off that, The Acrobats culls an even wider range of emotions from the band's combined sigh, showcasing surprisingly sharp (but sedated) pop chops carefully preserved in amber. It's no secret that scintillating guitar parts provide the fuel for Helvetia's space odyssey. On Acrobats, they're not afraid to set their axes to warp speed, even if it means sacrificing some of the lo-fi minimalism they're loved for. With guest appearances from veteran jamsters like Built to Spill's Brett Nelson and ex-Dinosaur Jr. bassist Mike Johnson, they're more than capable of pulling off densely layered gems like ""Blasting Carolina"", a kaleidoscopic epic traversing folk, glam, and sunny psych-pop. Standout track ""Old New Bicycle"" may carry the requisite stoner vibe associated with these guys, but it's more white soul than jam band. ""Honest Gods"" and ""Summer"" carry a similarly geeky libido, sounding too mathematical to be legitimately cool but, like equally stiff-postured acts the Walkmen or Kings of Convenience, pulling off the pop hooks all the same. So where does all this fretboard brio leave the vocals? Well, for the most part, buried six feet under the mix. When there isn't a nifty effect like the tube radio crooning on ""The Fever"" or ""Honest Gods""'s chipmunk-pitched harmonies, the melodies unfold pretty inconspicuously. Fortunately a three-note range goes a long way in Helvetia's brand of molasses pop, but when some of these songs do feel like boiling over (and yes, some actually do), the vocals aren't up to the task. That said, Acrobats proves a surprisingly engaging album from musicians who by all respects could be switching on autopilot at this point in their careers. Instead, they produce their catchiest piece of work to date while still keeping their riffs plentiful and their altitude at a steady 500,000 feet.","Second album from two members of defunct slowcore outfit Duster contains a wider range of emotions than its predecessor, showcasing surprisingly sharp (but sedated) pop chops carefully preserved in amber.

Directions to See a Ghost,The Black Angels,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b64513d197565213add7/1:1/w_160/05d9fe07.jpg,2008-06-03 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11540-directions-to-see-a-ghost/,Light in the Attic,"Trite as it is to dredge up drug-trip comparisons while attempting to describe how music sounds, there's a particular effect of failed, go-nowhere attempts at psychedelic rock: It aims for making you feel like you're high, or at least able to empathize with the notion of feeling high, but instead it's like you're actually stuck in a room with someone else who's high while you're sober. They're having the time of their lives, experiencing all sorts of mind-altering creativity, and here you are watching them flail around inanely-- or, worse yet, they just sit there staring into space. Even with a few good-to-great moments, this happens frequently during Directions to See a Ghost, the second full-length from Austin's Black Angels: The trip is implied, but it's all a secondhand narrative that loses almost everything in translation. The band members play under the impression that they're going somewhere, but it's a completely different place than where they actually are, and in either case there doesn't even really seem to be much of a destination in the first place. Put this album amidst a thousand other songs on your mp3 player of choice, and eventually one of the tracks will come up, and it'll sound unique and startling and impressively fuzzed-out and evil for a couple minutes. Odds are it'll then go on for another three or six or 14 until it becomes clear how little their grinding, snarling riffs and heavy-footed rhythms hold up under constant repetition. Sometimes this drone is enough to snatch your breath; there's enough of a melody (and a compellingly creepy one at that) in ""18 Years"" to sustain the song's five and a half minutes, and the slow, hypnotic swagger of ""Mission District"" pulls you in long enough to let one of the few really powerful crescendos on the album to hit you dead-on. And even if it takes a while to get to its core, ""Never/Ever"" peaks with this burst of high-speed chaos that condenses everything cool about ""Sister Ray"" into an efficiently malicious explosion But those songs come after an opening volley of not much, as the vertiginous midtempo shoegaze of opener ""You on the Run"" melts into the lurching, swooning ""Doves"" and then into the thumping sludge of ""Science Killer"", each song canceling out whatever sensations you might have felt from the previous. And all the interminable record-ending ""Snake in the Grass"" really does once it gets going (""going"" used loosely) is get a bit slower two-thirds of the way through its 16 minutes. Is it really worth listening to a song that goes on for more than a quarter of an hour if it actually loses energy the more it goes on? The bastard of it is that the lyrics fit the tone well-- all gloomy invocations of warfare, betrayal, paranoia, and self-obsession. And these people can play: There's some sparks when guitarist Christian Bland snaps out of his robo-strumming and actually sets about cranking out frightening peals of noise, Stephanie Bailey's drumming is forcefully solid even when the rhythms threaten to lull you into inattention, and every time I try to think of who lead singer Alex Maas is derivative of, I keep flashing back on their solid-enough 2006 debut Passover instead, which is as good a sign as any of how distinct his flat but doomed-sounding wail is. And if you isolate any random 45 seconds of Directions to See a Ghost's 70 minutes, you'll definitely be compelled to listen for another few minutes-- after which time you'll probably start waiting for a solo or a shift in tone that might not even come. One thing I've tried to keep in mind is the fact that the Black Angels tend to play live with film accompaniment, so maybe it works better in that context. Perhaps they could help those of us without any drugs by pressing this stuff on a DVD next time around.","Austin's Black Angels create a sprawling, psychedelic record dotted by gloomy invocations of warfare, betrayal, paranoia, and self-obsession.

Youth Novels,Lykke Li,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5bbb1335d7bf169a94f/1:1/w_160/493d43e9.jpg,2008-06-03 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11414-youth-novels/,LL,"Sweden has found a niche for itself as the backroom of modern pop. Its production teams provide the engineers for global Top 40 sounds; in men like Jens Lekman and Johan Agebjörn it produces theorists of pop classicism; and its own top-sellers, like Robyn and now Lykke Li, are welcomed into collections which otherwise carefully sidestep the commercial. So it's not wholly surprising that Youth Novels, Li's first full-length album, has the air of the workshop about it. The careful, spartan production-- by Bjorn Yttling of Peter Björn and John-- asks listeners to do more work than most pop records allow for. At its frequent best, the record manages to sketch out widescreen hit songs with a remarkable economy of means. At its more occasional worst, the tracks feel frustratingly underthought. The foundation for the successful songs tends to be voice and bass: the bass thick with reverb, the voice cute and close-up. Around this Yttrling-- who co-writes all the tracks-- places other instruments: splashes of piano or woodblock, petite guitar phrases, keyboard buzzes. The trick-- and they pull it off over and over again-- is to bring all the elements together on the chorus for a big hooky payoff. Of course for this to work they need strong choruses-- ""I'm Good, I'm Gone"", ""Let It Fall"", ""Hanging High"", and others provide them. Standout ""Dance Dance Dance"" has one of the stickiest refrains on the album, and one of the most audacious instrumental builds-- close-mic'ed bass, tippy-tappy percussion, and then suddenly a cheeky sax nudging its way into the track and scrapping puppyishly around its edges. If you don't smile at that, Lykke Li is probably not for you. With so many surprises in the arrangements, you might overlook what a strength Li herself is, how well she unifies Youth Novels' scattershot imagination. It's easy to dismiss her style as overly cutesy-- the babytalk chorus on first single ""Little Bit"", for instance-- and her fragility can seem annoyingly affected. But don't be fooled-- she's in total command of the songs, and her breathy fuzziness fits the wireframe aesthetic better than a fuller voice would. There are also hints that Li would be as happy with a richer sound-- on the beautiful ""My"" she's rolled and washed by cymbal, string, and echo and lets them envelop her without erasing her. Not all experiments work though, and when realizing ideas is less important than having them you're entering a slightly dangerous area. Li gives you fair warning that she'll do what she wants-- opener ""Melodies and Desires"" is ornamentally lovely but you won't linger long on its spoken-word philosophies. Even so, when her judgement fails to match her talent it can be painful going. Electro trudge ""Complaint Department"" in particular is dreary and grating enough to risk throwing your faith in the whole project off-beam: It doesn't help that Li can't remotely bring the venom the song needs. Thankfully she follows it with ""Breaking It Up"", one of her most vigorous and likeable tracks, whose blend of multi-tracked squawks and wandering synthesisers make for one of the album's most joyful moments. Chart music today is often so gloriously maximal that reproducing any of its thrills on limited means can seem an impossible task. By paying attention to detail, Yttling and Li's prove that doesn't have to be the case. But even more impressive is the way their intimate, playful miniatures capture the daring and novelty of modern pop, as well as its hooks.","The latest in a line of fine Swedish pop exports, Lykke Li's debut album-- which, although it seems like it's been around forever, is only just now out in the UK with a U.S. release to finally come this summer-- was produced and co-written by Björn Yttling of Peter Björn and John.

Songs in A&E,Spiritualized,by: Mike McGonigal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b664c0084474cd0c25a5/1:1/w_160/f4be7f29.jpg,2008-06-03 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11569-songs-in-ae/,InterscopeFontanaSpaceman,"I'm loathe to call any album a summation of an artist's career-- that reeks of lazy criticism-- but Songs in A&E is certainly Spiritualized's best work in 10 years. All of Jason Pierce's fascinations of the past 20-plus years appear here-- we'll get to 'em soon enough-- in a truly syncretic, muted, and beautiful way. And there's something rooted and grounded about Songs in A&E. Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in place. This is Pierce's first record in five years-- the delay was, in part, due to him being hospitalized with double pneumonia, i.e. he was really fucked-up and tethered to machines to keep him alive. (In the UK, the ER is called the Accident & Emergency ward-- hence the title.) Not surprisingly, Pierce's ordeal colors the sound and tone of the record-- ""Death Take Your Fiddle"", essentially another update of the traditional ""O Death"", seems to sample the sound of a respirator-- although Pierce has stated in interviews that the album was already more than half-finished when he took ill. Lyrically, as Pierce as wont to do, there are love songs, drug songs, and God songs-- typically, they're all those things at once at times. Pierce's protagonist on these tunes is world-weary (""So hard to fight when you're losing/ I got a little fire in my soul,"" he says on ""I Gotta Fire"") and sounds all the more so in Pierce's lovely croaking/cracking vocals. What saves the songs from woe-is-me solipsism and overarching sentimentality is a well-hidden but ironic sense of humor. Well, that and the fact that the music itself is awesome. The key song is ""Borrowed Your Gun"", which begins like a typical junkie lament with ""Daddy I'm sorry"" but continues into murder ballad territory with ""I borrowed your gun again/ Shot up your family."" A few songs on Songs in A&E run on a bit too long-- this is a Spiritualized record, after all-- and from some angles a few arrangements can sound hokey. The big rocker ""I Gotta Fire"" is like the Stone Roses covering Sonic Youth's ""Bull in the Heather"", but even on lesser tracks, a delightful oboe or a crazy lyric or a swelling gospel chorus swoops in and gives you a reason to replay the track. Pierce is again walking mopey, orchestral, minimalist rock out to the margins of taste and messing with your head all over the place. And this time he does it with a shit-ton of sonic subtlety. (Take those earbuds out and pop this one on the stereo.) Pierce has never seemed so in control of his aesthetic, rather than controlled by it like some sort of drone-rock fetishist. The props dropped here are super obvious, and meant to be so, whether to Daniel Johnston with the ""Funeral Home"" refrain or to Kris Kristofferson with a quotation from ""Me & Bobby McGee"". Prior releases each had enjoyable but indulgent bliss-out tracks that went on a long time, but on A&E the out sounds are distilled into six miniature numbered tracks each called ""Harmony"". These serve as a glue holding the album together, and while they're ""spacey,"" their brevity keeps the record on solid terrestrial ground. The other songs are vessels for contrasting ideas: la-la melodies vs. wah-wah guitar, strings vs. brass, country licks vs. Free Design-style vocals, and simple structures vs. lush arrangements. These oppositional concepts overlap more than ever on A&E, but the album only sounds muddled or muddied during a few clunky transitions. And weirdly, those serve to make you more aware than ever of the greatness of what he's doing the rest of the time.","After a five-year absence-- in part due to being hospitalized with double pneumonia-- Jason Pierce returns with another LP of love songs, drug songs, and God songs, producing his best record in a decade.

Sun Down,Nik Freitas,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b632c0084474cd0c2554/1:1/w_160/8b0f42a4.jpg,2008-06-02 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11523-sun-down/,Team Love,"You can't accuse Nik Freitas of not putting his best foot forward. His fourth LP (and first for Conor Oberst's Team Love imprint) opens with its sparkling title track-- a burst of mellow California sunshine featuring shuffling percussion, breezy guitar work, and Freitas' easy, warm voice. Its finger-picked guitar arpeggios are reminiscent of those from Nico's poignantly Germanic version of ""These Days"", but they re-imagine that song's brittle bones as a robust foundation for an upbeat vocal melody that gently rises and falls. It's not just a summery pop gem, though; buried beneath its lackadaisical pace and elegant piano bridge is lyrical gravitas. Despite its deceptively sweet sound, it is riddled with darkness and uncertainty-- there's a reason almost every line starts with the words, ""I want to know."" Sadly nothing else on Sun Down is quite as good. Freitas, an L.A.-by-way-of-Visalia singer/songwriter wrote, performed, and recorded everything on this album himself in a home studio that he lovingly created piecemeal via Craigslist. So, despite his album's effortless vibe, Freitas has obviously taken great pains with his work. He, like his inland Cali colleague Jason Lytle (of Grandaddy), has turned a lifelong Beatles fixation into impeccably arranged modern pop. (Check out the ""Rocky Raccoon""-style piano jaunt ""All The Way Down"".) But for someone who used to photograph skaters for a magazine as aggro-named as Thrasher, most of Sun Down seems so laid back that it's practically asleep. Like a mainland Jack Johnson with a vintage piano, Freitas seems to only write in one mid-tempo dynamic, and his cozy salve of a baritone is almost too soothing, so much so that it threatens to lull listeners to sleep. ""Sophie"" wants to be a bluesy Ryan Adams rocker, but with its out-of-place horns and middling lyrics, it doesn't have quite enough fire. (Say what you will about Adams, but his heroines have bigger, more dramatic problems than being mopey and needing to ""find some way to smile."") Spare piano ballad ""What You Become"" gets the intimacy right-- you can almost hear Freitas' fingers press against the smooth ivory keyboard-- but because it is so repetitive and lacks any clear hooks, it falls flat. And though ""Love Around"" is weirder and more majestic than the rest of the record-- it's built on layers of ghostly atmospherics worthy of The Virgin Suicides soundtrack and fills its hefty sound out with chunky drum fills and a churchy-sounding backing choir-- its main vocal melody meanders so aimlessly that it, too, is rendered unmemorable. Sun Down ends not with a bang, but with a whimper, leaving listeners with ""Shhhh"", a song that, even in its title, urges restraint. And perhaps that's Freitas' biggest problem: His songs are too quietly controlled. His  arrangements are admirable-- on the album closer his whispered sibilant sounds melt over an organ that buzzes in the distance, lapping at the edge of a rolling piano line-- so if he could just learn to indulge a little, to give in to an anthemic chorus or explore dynamic differences, his songs would be worthy of his pristine production.","Nik Freitas' fourth album-- and first for Conor Oberst's Team Love imprint-- was written and recorded at a home studio that he lovingly created piecemeal via Craigslist.

Heartcore,Wildbirds & Peacedrums,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5faea9e61561daa6ebb/1:1/w_160/feebaf82.jpg,2008-06-02 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11472-heartcore/,Leaf,"It's easy to think that music made by relatively few people, with relatively familiar instruments, should fall under the canopy of ""folk"": uncluttered, transparent, linked to past traditions. Wildbirds and Peacedrums-- husband-and-wife Swedes Andreas Werliin and Mariam Wallentin-- compose most of their debut, Heartcore, with Werliin's compact drum work and Wallentin's orbital, precise vocals; there is an arc to their work that imbues it with the austerity and heartiness (no pun) of folk music. Despite its simple ingredients, Heartcore is neither native nor instinctual. ""Primal"" or ""sparse"" miss the point, too; Heartcore, instead, is cleverly orchestrated pop music preternaturally reliant on the skills of its performers: Both Werliin and Wallentin were music school dropouts, and their technically sound playing disguises the complexity and range of Heartcore's material. The album Heartcore strangely resembles is Nina Simone's In Concert; where Simone used tactful playing and sly phrasing to redress Gershwin or a song about pirates, W&P build murder ballads with tinny, metronomic percussion and tense rock'n'roll with handclaps and double-tracked wails. Other instruments-- electric piano, rippling guitar, moony organ-- are in the mix as ornamentation: Only the drums are allowed to roll downhill. Wallentin mimics Simone's deep, mannish voice and almost asexual engagement with her material but oversell/rhetoric aside she rightfully garners comparisons to Björk's bluster or Joanna Newsom's clench. (Another contemporary: The first line in ""Bird"" is actually ""I am a bird now."") Wallentin's legit pipes carry Heartcore's swirling, clackety uptempo numbers: ""Doubt/Hope"", ""The Way Things Go"", and ""The Ones That Should Save Me Get Me Down"" rely on little more than Werliin's tethered kitwork. Doubt is a theme whenever the lyrics seem autobiographical, to the point where ""The Way Things Go"" serves as proper self-help: ""I neeeeeed/ To love myseeeeelf/ More."" Werliin steps from behind his kit to duet on the violent ""The Battle in Water"" and his comparatively untrained male vox sounds phantasmal: ""I am in the wilderness/ You turned out my light/ This time I will make things right/ I get cold by fire/ She said…"" and then Wallentin again, ""Let me swim/ I'm no one's pet."" W&P may have overplayed their hand a bit naming the album Heartcore, but they deserve credit for these resonant, personal dramas. The instrumental framing of the album allows the W&P plenty of elbow room, but Heartcore still fails when the duo becomes overly reliant on balladry: Whatever percussion/string instrument plinks along with ""Lost Love"" can't draw a melody out of Wallentin; ""Nakina""'s buttressed bass kicks are the only arrangement that might be called out as lazy, and both move at a glacial pace. During ""Mississippi Goddam"" Nina Simone exclaims, to the delight of the crowd, ""This is a showtune, but the show hasn't been written for it yet""; Heartcore exemplifies this sense of constructed intrigue: Wallentin notes, ""All of the people are running to the theater."" Peek, too, at the resplendent closer, ""We Hold Each Other Song"", tipping its cards in two movements: first a low-hum organ dirge and then a loving, jaunty coda. ""The inside is not new,"" Wallentin states. True, but what Werliin and Wallentin surround it with requires plenty of exploration.","Swedish husband-and-wife duo Andreas Werliin and Mariam Wallentin offer a debut album on Leaf composed of his compact drum work and her orbital, precise vocals.

Velocifero,Ladytron,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b651c0084474cd0c2587/1:1/w_160/d92b63ee.jpg,2008-06-02 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11551-velocifero/,Nettwerk,"Not only was Witching Hour one of the better albums of 2005, it more or less saved Ladytron's career. For a group that sprang up right on time for the whole early-aughts electroclash morass to subsume them, the group's transformation to a subtly more melodic, pop-friendly, and emotionally expressive style made a lot of sense, both in terms of stylistic evolution and just plain old self-preservation. It's the same instinct that kept New Order and Depeche Mode going long after people stopped using the term ""new wave"" in earnest-- and even if there was still plenty of runway-walk detachment in their sound, the music made it feel perfectly human. But there's another human impulse that keeps the follow-up Velocifero from hitting quite as hard, and that's the desire to stick with what works, especially if that formula took you to another level. There's not much wrong with that method where this album's concerned; substituting refinement and subtle expansion for constant evolution isn't that heinous a crime, and being big on Witching Hour will probably lead you to appreciate Velocifero in a more reserved way. There's no pinned-to-your-seat blowaways like ""Destroy Everything You Touch"" or ""High Rise"", a shortage of legitimately affecting ballads in the vein of ""All the Way..."" or ""Beauty*2"", and a severe dearth of the subtle levity that made Witching Hour an expansive record-- in other words, there's really not a lot of immediacy to Velocifero at all. What this record does have is a solid number of goth-pop hookfests. Compared to the highlights of their previous records, the songs on Velocifero have more movement than actual force; the shuffle-glam ""Ghosts"" gets surprisingly little bass-range impact from such a heavy stomp, and the rapid synth-pop pulses on ""I'm Not Scared"" and ""Season of Illusions"" threaten to slip from a groove to a rut if you think of them strictly in terms of rhythm. (For a record with some input from Ed Banger electro-pop remix specialists Vicarious Bliss, that's kind of hard to imagine.) But the vocals make up for that, and aside from the occasional lyrical clunker (from ""Versus"": ""like a kitten versus rain""-- d'aww, sniffle), it's impressive how Helen Marnie and Mira Aroyo take empty-on-paper lyrics and give them meaning through sheer repetition. We've already heard more than enough about little runaways from Del Shannon (and, uh, Bon Jovi), but Marnie's singing in ""Runaway"" sweetly offsets the harsh snarl of Velocifero's hardest-hitting instrumental backing and turns a pop cliché (""Where you waking up today/ My little runaway"") into a haunting refrain. The aforementioned ""Ghosts"" works because its enigmatic hook-- ""There's a ghost in me/ Who wants to say I'm sorry/ Doesn't mean I'm sorry""-- is delivered with Marnie's note-perfect sing-song delivery, a simultaneously taunting and regretful voice which not only gives the words gravity but lends a good amount of weight to an otherwise flat-sounding song. And Mira Aroyo, relatively scarce on Witching Hour, has more opportunities to showcase her icy, sharp, often-foreboding voice, singing in her native Bulgarian with a sinister deadpan on ""Black Cat"" and a sleek, mellifluous energy on traditional folk song ""Kletva""; in English her raspy purr turns the circa-1990 techno-pop of ""Deep Blue"" into a seething come-on. Writers and fans like to talk about how wintry and cold Ladytron's music is, which might be the album's real shortcoming; maybe it'll sound a bit more appropriate five or six months after its June release when its isolated iciness has a suitable environmental backdrop. But even with a somewhat diminished speaker-filling capability and a couple of songs that seem to have less actual energy than they should, Velocifero's subtlety will eventually reward further listens. Not everything has to be an exclamation point or a CGI explosion, and even if Ladytron excel in big, instant-grab attention-getting pop maneuvers, the dearth of them here only means that they've got a good venue to prove they can get by OK on restraint.","Ladytron follow the expansive, immediate Witching Hour with a record of more restrained goth-pop.

Weezer (Red Album),Weezer,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6639d034d5c69bf51c2/1:1/w_160/0503e573.jpg,2008-06-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11568-weezer-the-red-album/,DGCInterscope,"Although weaned on prog-metal, educated in classical music at Harvard, and once viewed as a representative of the indie rock set, Weezer's Rivers Cuomo prefers to write simple music that can be easily enjoyed by a mass audience. It was one of many elements that defined him in the beginning, on his band's hugely popular 1994 self-titled debut (The Blue Album), if one of few remaining characteristics defining his music today. Following poor initial sales of the record's follow-up, the more introspective cult hit Pinkerton, Cuomo famously retreated from the public eye. Over the next five years, the band would remain silent, cultivating goodwill and an ever-growing army of fans. But most of that goodwill has deteriorated since their re-emergence in 2001, in the wake of three mediocre-to-awful albums that were, in many ways, the opposite of what made Cuomo's band so adored in the first place. Sadly, the once burned-out Weezer continue to fade away: Those first two records capture their decade in 75 minutes of near-perfect power-pop: straight-faced irony, eccentric sincerity, meta references, and bipolar guitar distortion from ordinary-looking outcasts who became stars and then complained about it. Punk that's too catchy to offend. Pop that's too smart to cop to itself. And, uh, emo. After Pinkerton, the deluge; rap-metal and post-grunge wound up so thoroughly conquering modern rock that now even staunch rockists are making excited noises about ""American Idol"" winner David Cook. Hey, somebody's supposed to save mainstream rock'n'roll, right? Not these guys. Beginning with 2001's so-so Green Album and plumbing Jules Verne depths with 2005's terrible Make Believe, the band began to take on some of the most infuriating characteristics of the very bands that had replaced them during their absence: intelligence-insulting songwriting, cookie-cutter dynamics, questionable facial hair. At the very least, The Red Album (as Weezer have nicknamed their latest) is a first step toward rehabilitation-- a tacit admission that recent discs, with their empty universality and recycled riffs, had a problem. But it's not a return to glory unless you consider 2001 their glory days. Judging by appetizing first single ""Pork and Beans"", The Red Album could've been almost as funny and catchy as Pinkerton's ""El Scorcho"", only from the perspective of a married man coming up on 40. It's as if last year's demos compilation, Alone, helped Cuomo remember how to do this stuff right. His sarcastic mention of super-producer Timbaland's chart magic is as hilarious as it is on-point-- especially after Madonna's dreadful, Tim-helmed #1 single, ""4 Minutes"". Jacknife Lee (who co-produced the album along with Make Believe overseer Rick Rubin) lets the chorus explode from the mix in a way that little on the radio does anymore. It demands to be sung by millions of uncomprehending bar-goers. With an opening Rogaine reference, ""Pork and Beans"" also establishes The Red Album's main theme. Already a self-described ""old man"" on Pinkerton, Cuomo is focused these days on reliving his lost youth-- probably the same reason some of us still listen to Weezer albums. Lead track and third single ""Troublemaker"" starts back in school, a faint whiff of existential angst and a surging bridge helping to redeem a vapid chorus and monotonous, familiar-sounding guitars. The laughably bad ""Heart Songs"" is The Blue Album's nostalgic ""In the Garage"" schmaltzed up as a sort of name-dropping ""Circle of Life""; if Nirvana had ""the chords that broke the chains I had upon me,"" kudos to Cuomo for swiping them on the otherwise forgettable teenage prankfest ""Everybody Get Dangerous"" (to quote: ""boo-yahhh""). At this point, Weezer is as much a brand as a band. When Cuomo relinquishes the mic, The Red Album could be by any group of modern-rock mediocrities. Longtime guitarist Brian Bell gets throaty and twangy like a poor man's Rob Thomas on repetitive non-apology ""Thought I Knew"", backed by bland acoustic guitar and a TR-808 drum machine. Bassist Scott Shriner speak-sings in creepy stalker mode on ""Cold Dark World"", with Cuomo swooping to the rescue on the choruses. ""Automatic"", led by original drummer Pat Wilson, returns to the faceless crunching of 2002's Maladroit. Not that Cuomo needs other voices to reveal that The Red Album is hardly the work of idiosyncratic auteurship the first couple of singles could've suggested. He sings on peppy, tempo-switching ""Dreamin'"" and the grandiose finale, ""The Angel and the One"", but for all their background-friendly polish, both are typical, vacuous latter-day Weezer tracks. The Red Album's most ambitious song adapts the Shaker hymn ""Simple Gifts"". The melody, played first on piano recalling Pinkerton's ""Across the Sea"", is more obvious than the Erik Satie snippet Cuomo ganked for The Blue Album's ""Surf Wax America"", but now, as then, the theft isn't the point. ""The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)"" is the warped genius let loose, from half-rapped intro to Queen bombast to baroque a cappella. Like the YouTube culture the ""Pork and Beans"" video depicts so well, the song-- and this album-- relies on a high quantity of short-lived pretty good ideas to distract from a shortage of great ones.",,4.7,
Massive Conspiracy Against All Life / Lurker of Chalice,LeviathanLurker of Chalice,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b639ea9e61561daa6f24/1:1/w_160/9e10fd34.jpg,2008-06-02 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11682-massive-conspiracy-against-all-lifelurker-of-chalice/,Moribund,"The one-man band has come a long way from the stereotypical busker laden with instruments from head to foot. With today's technology, individuals often surpass the capabilities and limits of full bands. Black metal, in particular, has embraced solo recording for aesthetic and practical reasons. The artform's venom is antisocial; recording at home is also cheaper and less hassle than practice spaces and bandmates. Lacking the metal-rich environment and close distances of their European counterparts, American black metallers have made the one-man format uniquely theirs. Lone wolves like Xasthur, Krohm, and Sapthuran turn black metal's explosive energy inwards; Leviathan is arguably the most potent of the lot. Like his colleagues, San Francisco's Leviathan (aka Wrest) deals with depressive/suicidal themes. But unlike them, he wields instrumental prowess that amplifies the personal into the epic. Drums are his first instrument, and they propel his songs through widely varied feels: light-speed blastbeats, mid-paced trudges, tricky math meters. On guitar, he fluently dials up the raw primitiveness of black metal's first wave, the romantic nihilism of the second wave, and shoegazer sheets of sound. His bass lines have an unmatched warmth and fluidity. He's also a celebrated tattoo artist; his wrenching artwork adorns albums by Heresi, Winterblut, and himself. In short, he is the total package. Massive Conspiracy Against All Life is aptly-titled; Wrest sounds like he's throwing everything and the kitchen sink against the world. His are the bitterest symphonies-- in a past life, he was probably a composer whose works caused riots-- and Conspiracy is his rage writ large. Leviathan's discography (three full-lengths, numerous demos and splits) has varied widely in production values; Conspiracy is the first time his apocalypse has had a sound to match. The record evokes both a missile attack and its aftermath. Eerie jangles swoop down on ""Made as the Stale Wine of Wrath"", paving the way for a ground assault of blastbeats. ""Vesture Dipped in the Blood of Morning"" has what sounds like a martial orchestral sample, as if Sousa had written not for triumph but for tragedy. ""Noisome Ash Crown"" deceptively meanders in a fog, then unleashes a stomping death march. Wrest's voice rises above the fray like a warlord general; unlike his colleagues, who often sound like malnourished witches, he declaims with a commanding growl. Yet his attack is not all blitzkrieg. Wrest adeptly conjures up wind-like sounds, whether through guitars or electronic means, and much of the record feels like a sepulchral cave. The Book of Revelation has many metal soundtracks, but few have channeled its torment this vividly. Lurker of Chalice is a project by Wrest that released an eponymous full-length in 2005. The release gained cult status, with accompanying eBay prices, and Southern Lord has reissued it with a bonus track. Lurker of Chalice is Leviathan's drugged-out cousin; black metal is still the starting point, but the departure points are more varied. ""Wail""'s buzzing miasma is as if Angelo Badalamenti scored actual nightmares and not just hints of them. ""Spectre As Valkerie Is"" glows with a luminous shoegazer aura, with small shooting stars of melodies. Clean tones form a densely gorgeous web in ""Vortex Chalice"". ""Minions"" lays strips of twang atop slabs of doom. ""This Blood Falls as Mortal, Pt. 3"" has seasick, kazoo-like melodies and a curiously perky 808 hi-hat. Wrest even tries out actual singing in ""Granite"", but shrouds it in haunting echoes. But for all its dreaminess, Lurker still brings the hammer. The atonal glissandos of ""Piercing Where They Might"" resemble demonic vacuum cleaners; ""Spectre"" begins with wrecking balls for riffs. For unknown reasons, Wrest is retiring the Leviathan name, so his future output will be as Lurker of Chalice. Each project already has elements of the other, so their unification promises more of the same: the sound of the end of the world.","San Francisco's blackest metal heart casts a shadow over the world on a new full-length and a crucial reissue.

Tijuana Sound Machine,Nortec Collective Presents Bostich + Fussible,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b649b1335d7bf169aa2b/1:1/w_160/25a548d9.jpg,2008-05-30 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11544-tijuana-sound-machine/,Nacional,"There's a cheap gag in No Country For Old Men where Josh Brolin's character-- basically left for dead, his clothes caked in dried blood-- wakes up lying on the ground across the Mexican border to a mariachi band looming over his body. Never mind why a mariachi band would be performing for an unconscious gringo in the first place, especially since they seem surprised when he opens his eyes. The point's been made: if you're lying in the dirt beaten and bloody, is there anything you'd like to wake up to less than a mariachi band blaring away in your face? Again, it's a cheap gag, as Mexico's got one of the most vibrant music scenes in the world, from traditional mariachi music to Mexico City's rock en español contingent, the latter known for bridging the country's rich musical heritage with more modern sounds and strains. From the start, that's been the similar goal of Nortec Collective, whose name conflates the words ""norteno"" and ""techno,"" and whose music pairs manic accordion, trumpet, and bajo sexto with samples and electronic beats. Unfortunately, most of the songs on the group's Nortec Collective Presents: Bostich + Fussible-- Tijuana Sound Machine only fitfully fuse the traditional with the modern, and the problem sure isn't the acoustic instrumentation. If anything, there's not enough of the traditional in what often sounds like a Casio demo gone amuck, and the gimmick-- transforming accordions and horns into rhythmic tools-- feels, in fact, somewhat cheap. But what really hurts Tijuana Sound Machine is its relentlessly uninventive and static electronic flourishes, Nortec Collective's ostensible claim to fame. Wan ditties like ""Brown Bike"" and ""Wanted"", or the outright annoying ""Shake It Up"" make the mistakes not normally associated with the loose-in-numbers but still tightly aligned members of the Collective, who in the past have skirted novelty. Here, on the other hand, with members Bostich (Ramon Amezcua) and Fussible (Pepe Mogt) taking the lead, track after track bleats out like an alarm clock from hell, less likely to call you to the dance floor than make you clutch that pillow tighter around your ears. ""Mi Casita"", ""Akai 47"", and ""Mama Loves Nortec"" are nominally hip novelties, but novelties all the same, though the latter does finally allow the trumpet to shine through as more than just accent or afterthought. Of course, the relentless polka beat is a genre mainstay, but just as other dance music makes the most of 4/4, surely there's room for a little variation. Even when a track like ""Cetron"" briefly teeters toward an exciting bustle befitting its urban inspiration, it feels reigned in, over-quantized, safe and sterile. And generally speaking, if there's one thing Tijuana is not, it's safe and sterile.","A Nortec Collective presentation (think Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning's ""Broken Social Scene Presents"" solo records), here Bostich + Fussible transform accordions and horns into rhythmic tools, leaning heavily on modern sounds at the expense of more traditional ones.

Tragicomic,Vijay Iyer,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b62a5e6ef959693228ca/1:1/w_160/ce52eecf.jpg,2008-05-30 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11516-tragicomic/,Sunnyside,"Human beings have invented hundreds of instruments for themselves, on which to play an incredible range of different musics-- I went through a phase in my music listening where I'd buy an album just because it had weird instruments on it. But as fun as it is to seek out all the different timbres and tonal possibilities on offer, you could spend a pretty satisfying lifetime just listening to all the ways a single instrument can be used a re-employed in different contexts and by different players. Hell, you could probably spend a lifetime just building a thorough understanding of all the ways the piano is used in jazz. Take a trawl back through the instrument's recorded history in the genre, and you'll find all kinds of approaches-- a knowledgeable listener will never mistake the swirling, busy style of Art Tatum for Thelonious Monk's dissonant, strangely twisting improvisations, for instance. In the jazz world, it's a fight for every musician to carve out his or her own little instrumental niche, to find that thing as a musician that makes them distinct. Some never do, others constantly change in a search for their style, and still others are just born to sound like no one but themselves. It's not a stretch to put Vijay Iyer in that final category. Iyer has a very unique approach to comping chords, constantly moving back and forth between notes in the chord to create a throbbing background pulse. It's more a sheet of sound than traditional jazz piano. You'll hear it used as an effect frequently in jazz, but it's rare that this textural technique becomes the center of a player's style, and it's made Iyer's playing uniquely suited to crossing the thin lines between jazz and hip-hop to collaborate with indie hip-hop auteur Mike Ladd. Along with his two headlining collaborations with Ladd, Iyer's helmed or co-helmed a dozen LPs-- he stretches his style in every direction imaginable, and his compositions tend to mix moody textural passages with bursts of odd rhythm, some that even sound like riffs. Modern jazz rarely follows the old ""head/solos/head"" format that typified be-bop, and Iyer uses his compositions as mood pieces, setting them against each other in a bid to change the feeling the record produces from song to song. He has a versatile band in saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, bassist Stephan Crump, and drummer Marcus Gilmore, who flow right along with him and easily handle the odd meters and start-stops he gives them. The album creeps into being with the nebulous, slowly coalescing ""The Weight of Things"" (it's an open improv credited to the whole group) before exploding into a full-on lurch on ""Macaca Please"". Mahanthappa does some of his most ferocious lead playing on this track, though he outclasses himself later in the album on ""Without Lions"", where his sax line practically sounds like a jazz take on ""Flight of the Bumblebee"". Tragicomic, true to its title, is an album about balance-- see the way, for example, that Iyer follows the buoyant sunny ""I'm All Smiles"" with the evil, odd-metered stormer ""Machine Days""-- and what rises from nothing at the beginning dissipates again into nothing again with the final track. It's the end note to a satisfying album from a unique pianist who continues to show us what his instrument can do.","Jazz pianist and Mike Ladd collaborator Vijay Iyer's compositions tend to mix moody textural passages with bursts of odd rhythm, some that even sound like riffs.

Over a militaristic drum-and-flute backdrop, a gang of schoolkids draw some battle lines between themselves and their more mature counterparts. Avowing that ""we are not afraid of you grown-ups,"" the girls demand access to hammers, while the boys promise to ""talk to the king of this kingdom, if you don't let us play with dolls."" Then Merilahti comes in, her own voice betraying both the naive lilt of a little girl and a bit of the coarseness of someone a bit older-- or maybe just another kid who's been yelling too much. A group of children wise enough (or maybe just fed the appropriate knowledge), to demand upended gender norms, ""Hustle"" is the perfect prologue for the Dø's debut, A Mouthful, an album that tries to balance the immature and the grown-up. The Paris-based duo of Finnish expat Merilahti and French multi-instrumentalist Dan Levy pronounce their name ""doe,"" a reference to the alpha and omega of the musical scale, which they interpret as a license to incorporate ""what's new and what's old,"" with ""the latitude & longitude to re-invigorate any musical genre."" It's their first stab at an LP, and it's not surprising that their youthful capriciousness amazes as often as it goes astray. The two aren't shy about toying with musical categories, but it's Mouthful's wide register of emotions-- a fine actress, Merilahti does playful, frustrated, coy, fearful and romantic very well-- which compensates for the less-than-advisable inclusions, and the record is as ambitious and fun as any coming-out party in recent memory. In his review last month of Wye Oak's debut With Children, Mike Powell wrote: ""Their sound-- earnest folk-influenced indie rock with touches of noise and dream-pop-- is so second-nature that nobody realizes it's actually endangered."" When the Dø hit their stride on A Mouthful, they channel that same potent naiveté, with Merilahti's voice as the key ingredient. Bearing a confidence and delicacy recalling Liz Phair, Mary Timony, and especially Frente's Angie Hart, Merilahti's girlish growl nestles within the gray tones of post-shoegaze 1990s rock. To this end, Merilahti revels in lyrical contradictions, pushing her beau away forcefully with one hand while keeping a handful of his shirt in the other. In ""On My Shoulders"", she does Sisyphean work amidst swelling strings and smears of feedback, regretting her loveless labor while promising to keep at it. When she sings ""next time, I'll try it another way,"" her voice tears just enough to reveal her pain and passion-- to what end, we don't find out. On ""The Bridge Is Broken"" her raspy melisma is endorsed by the backmasked guitars, shakers, and handclaps, creating a lush sense of romantic resignation, and a slight bit of distortion winds its way under the otherwise pristine ballad ""At Last!"", emphasizing the forlorn melody of the album's best song. Thrilled enough at finding love to walk on air for 92 hours, Merilahti stops short of gloating to her friends: ""I won't say no more, I won't make it harder on you girls."" It's rare to find a good pop song in which the singer confronts, then stops short of succumbing to pleasure. Girl groups, Lesley Gore, and Smokey Robinson come to mind. Sleater-Kinney, too. Merilahti's emotional antagonism comes full-force on ""Stay (Just a Little Bit More)"", in which she confronts her two-faced paramour-- she's ""young, but believes in no tales""-- before getting scared and luring him back to bed. The song, a faithful take on Lily Allen's brand of scatological ska-pop, is the strongest evidence of the Dø's penchant for generic interpretation and cross-pollination. Elsewhere, a couple dramatic ballads (""Song for Lovers"" and ""Searching Gold""), overstay their welcome a bit, but two worldbeat bangers (""Tammie"" and the Finnish-language ""Unissasi Laulelet"") more than make up for it. There's even an appearance from that other endangered early 90s relic, the goofy pop-rap one-off: ""Queen Dot Kong"" would have made a swell B-side, but bundled on the LP it juts out awkwardly. Within A Mouthful's over-swelled 69-minute (!) runtime is a wonderful 48-minute album; the excess material isn't unlistenable by any stretch, but it does suggest the need for a bit more quality control. It will require Merilahti and Levy to re-prioritize how they use their youthful exuberance-- from all-inclusive tracklists to more wonderful songs like ""At Last!"" and ""On My Shoulders"". It's a bit paternal-sounding, I know. For the time being, then, let's let them have fun. ","The Paris-based duo of Finnish expat Olivia Merilahti and French multi-instrumentalist Dan Levy offer a pleasantly surprising album that tries to balance the immature and the grown-up.

What Does It All Mean? 1983-2006 Retrospective,Steinski,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b633ea9e61561daa6f17/1:1/w_160/da1e27b5.jpg,2008-05-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11524-what-does-it-all-mean-1983-2006-retrospective/,Illegal Art,"The more you think about it, the more ironically fitting it is that one of the biggest watershed moments in hip-hop history-- the controversy over sample rights and sonic appropriation-- was made by a 32-year-old TV commercial producer. Steve Stein was far from a dilettante; as one half of the megamix-specialist duo Double Dee and Steinski, he was already deep enough into the embryonic genre to change the game with his first release, 1983's epochal sample-slayer ""Lesson 1 (The Payoff Mix)"". A track they put together for a remix contest (which they won handily), ""The Payoff Mix"" was a rework of G.L.O.B.E. & Whiz Kid's ""Play That Beat Mr. DJ"" that didn't just wrap the Tommy Boy electro joint around the appropriate references to ""Rock It"" and ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"", but threw in all kinds of Casablanca soundbites and dance instructor lessons and Little Richard vocals, too. Never mind that they weren't virtuoso DJs and actually put the whole thing together using an 8-track recorder and a tape deck; this took hip-hop's tradition of reformatting existing material and made it a postmodern funhouse. For a generation raised on the 30-second educational mini-films of ""Sesame Street"" and the fleeting stimulus of channel surfing, Steinski's own recipe for ricocheting attention spans was a natural fit: lay down a beat, switch it up a bunch of times to keep things jumping, weave in a bunch of thematic, sometimes smart-assed clips of TV news voice-overs or political speeches, and damn the lawyers. It was already well-known how legally dicey and largely unreleaseable his music was back in March 1986, when critic Robert Christgau wrote a Village Voice article referring to this music with the headline ""Great Dance Records You Can't Buy"", but he got right to the heart of Steinski's soundbite technique when he dubbed him ""a perpetually disillusioned optimist who still assumes that the sounds and images rippling through the American consciousness are, forget copyright, every American's birthright."" Not long afterwards, Steinski would release ""The Motorcade Sped On"", a dance record about the JFK assassination that was difficult to get into the American consciousness-- unless said American was able to subscribe to the NME, where it was given away as a flexidisc. In fact, with most of Steinski's material previously only available in bootleg form, the 2xCD best-of What Does It All Mean? 1983-2006 Retrospective does a great service in collecting all his prime material in one place-- not just the bulk of his solo work, but the entirety of his 2002 BBC/Solid Steel rough mix Nothing to Fear, widely considered one of the best mixes of the last several years. Nothing to Fear might be the surprise highlight of this collection, even accounting for all the classic stuff on the first disc. It's nice to hear Steinski do his thing for more than just a few minutes at a time, and at just under an hour, it's got a lot of crazy notions, elbow-ribbing and sharp gags packed into its running time, even as it maintains a deep focus on also acting as something danceable. The recognizable (Blackalicious' ""Swan Lake""; Nelly's ""Country Grammar""; De La Soul's ""The Art of Getting Jumped"") segues easily into the arcane; there'll be a number of times you'll hear a naggingly familiar yet unplaceable old-school b-boy break, and it might wind up driving you nuts. It's all bolstered by a succession of punchlines and soundbites that nudge each other out of the way even as they create a multi-generational stream of consciousness: there's Glengarry Glen Ross, ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"", and Groucho Marx; there's preachers, comedians, and a self-aware drop of Louis Farrakhan exclaiming to the attendees of Jack the Rapper's 1980 convention that ""white people are in the business of mind control""; there's foley-room clips of ""Star Trek"" sound effects and pratfall bone fractures; there are recontextualized koans and truisms: ""this is a special magic,"" ""wait a minute-- are you guys actually gonna go through with this thing?"", ""the airwaves are sacred."" Steinski doesn't shy away from his elder statesman status on this mix (one semi-appalled ident: ""he's old enough to be my father!""), but the old-school-meets-new-school feeling makes his early-fifties age irrelevant; so much gets thrown at you through this mix that its allegiance to any kind of specific signifiers-- coasts, styles, eras, generations, anything deeper than ""hip-hop in general""-- is practically nil. A greater insight into Steinski's style and sonic identity is, of course, available on the first disc, ranging from straight-up b-boy anthems into unnerving, borderline avant-garde looks into some of America's bleakest moments. By 1985 Steinski and his partner Double Dee had crafted two additional ""Lessons"" to augment ""The Payoff Mix"". ""Lesson 2 (James Brown Mix)"" is self-explanatory: At a time when the 808 still ruled rap production, it was an unusual and prescient idea to string together a track interweaving some traditional hip-hop touchstones (""Apache"", ""Double Dutch Bus"") with a number of different fragments from several of James Brown's funk hits; all that remained was for the Bomb Squad to perfect the science. ""Lesson 3 (History of Hip Hop)""-- from 1985; talk about your unfinished story-- cements the historical import of the genre's breakbeat aspect via a smartly hijacked JFK quote (""the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans""), a nod to Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet Rock"" and go-to breakbeats like Dennis Coffey's ""Scorpio"" and Herman Kelly & Life's ""Dance to the Drummer's Beat"". And the two reunion tracks that Double Dee and Steinski made together after over a decade apart-- 1998's hyperactive, elastic, almost completely transformative old-school funk-party remix of Bambaataa's ""Jazzy Sensation"" and 1999's quick-cutting, label-spanning ultramix ""Voice Mail (Sugar Hill Suite)""-- reveal a certain giddiness over being able to work with classic material again. But while there's plenty of strength in his later material-- the velvet scuzz of Coldcut-collaborative phone-sex pastiche ""I'm Wild About That Thing"", the sinister bop-funk of ""Vox Apostolica"", ""Ain't No Thing"", which expertly stitches together selections from Stones Throw's The Third Unheard: Connecticut Hip-Hop 1979-1983 comp-- Steinski's most daring work is in controversy-courting, culture-jamming political needling. The juxtaposition of as-it-happens news clips with pop debris in ""The Motorcade Sped On""-- the intro to ""The Tonight Show"", the first note of the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night"", and the cowbell of the Rolling Stones' ""Honky Tonk Women"" slowed to a slump-shouldered skulk-- is tasteless in theory, but the sense of panic and confusion that Steinski puts together through repetition and multi-layered, often-clashing sounds manages to give it an unnerving gravity. 1992's ""It's Up to You (Television Mix)"" builds on a catchy loop of the Jackson 5's ""It's Great to Be Here"" and creates one of the few anti-Gulf War protest songs of the era, transforming Bush's speech into a pop hook (""Regrettably, we now believe/ That only force will make him leave"") and interspersing quotes from Jello Biafra (""don't hate the media, become the media!"") and Mario Savio's famous 1964 address to the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. And then there's the last track, the previously-unreleased ""Number Three on Flight Eleven"", which weaves audio of Betty Ong's cell phone call from United Flight 11 on 9/11 into an unsettling, ambient Eno-esque dirge-- the only track on this compilation that's legitimately difficult to listen to. ""Lesson 2"" answered this collection's titular question with a quote from Fab 5 Freddy's ""Change the Beat"" (""this stuff is really fresh""), but it's also deep. And probably illegal, too, but that just makes it an essential crime.","Illegal Art, home of Girl Talk, celebrates sampling pioneer Steinski, who took hip-hop's tradition of reformatting existing material and made it a postmodern funhouse.

II Trill,Bun B,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b65bea9e61561daa6f6c/1:1/w_160/9df99c40.jpg,2008-05-30 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11561-ii-trill/,Rap-A-LotAsylum,"Bun B is a solo artist not by choice but by necessity. After spending a decade and a half in the legendary Texas rap duo UGK, Bun found himself all alone in 2002, when Pimp C, his partner, went to prison on a parole-violation charge. With Pimp gone, Bun hit the guest appearance circuit hard and eventually released Trill, his decent-enough 2005 solo debut. At the tail end of 2005, Pimp came home, and the reunited duo crafted the triumphant double album Underground Kingz. One of the few truly feel-good comeback stories in rap was cut short this past December when Pimp died from complications of sleep apnea. A few months later, Bun returns to the solo slog. If nothing else, II Trill makes for a great story of personal resilience. Bun B is one of the South's great rap voices: He has a gravelly depth-charge snarl that belies a rapid-fire bounce-rap delivery and always finds a way to effortlessly blend with even the most complicated drum patterns. But solo Bun will never work anywhere near as well as UGK did. In UGK, Pimp's nasal libertine honk played counterpoint to Bun's authoritative rumble, and Pimp's crushingly humid country-funk beats gave Bun's voice focus and direction. And Pimp or no Pimp, the 2008 Bun is nowhere near as ecstatically word-drunk as he once was; no line on II Trill rivals this astoundingly awesome boast from 2001's ""Wood Wheel"": ""Smoking on bionic bubonic chronic, it's so ironic/ Sipping gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic."" The Bun we hear on II Trill is weirdly workmanlike, a technical beast without a whole lot to say beyond obligatory lines about his realness. Throughout II Trill, Bun largely ignores the tragic context surrounding the album, preferring instead to lock into his time-tested lyrical tropes; the small army of guest-rappers on the album mentions Pimp more often than Bun does. Along with the booty-clap club-track ""Pop It 4 Pimp"", the only Pimp C eulogy here is ""Angel in the Sky"", a toothless rap&b lament. Back on the first Trill, Bun spent six minutes on ""The Story"" directly and candidly detailing UGK's history over a hard beat without letting a chorus interrupt him. Touching as it might be, ""Angel in the Sky"" has none of that scope or specificity. Instead, Bun sounds like he's trying to cope with loss by getting back to business as usual, an understandable response but not one that makes for a terribly compelling end-to-end listen. And yet II Trill is still a stronger album than its predecessor, largely because its producers keep things cohesive, doing their best to stay within Pimp's organic-thump blueprint, and because the guest rappers here seem to realize they're on tracks with Bun B and that they have to step their shit up accordingly. On ""Damn I'm Cold"", which should've been the first single, Bun and Lil Wayne trade wicked punchlines over Chops' swampy blues-guitar noodles and screaming organs. ""Swang on Em"" brings martial snares, horns, and a surprisingly slippery fake-Southern Lupe Fiasco cameo. On ""Get Cha Issue"", Bun uses Bigg Tyme's grimy chopped-up bar-rock track to momentarily depart from his standard block-talk, kicking nebulously political end-times proclamations (addressing elected leaders: ""Y'all some liars, stealers, philanderers and all/ Got senators sucking dick inside of bathroom stalls""). But nothing sounds as great as ""Underground Thang"", where Pimp C's disembodied voice returns, bringing with it the group chemistry and the guttural asshole charisma missing elsewhere. With its near-endless running-time and its occasional misguided bids for radio-play (the thoroughly meh Sean Kingston-assisted single ""That's Gangsta"" springs to mind), II Trill feels like a throwback to a time when record labels were actually willing to devote resources toward recording and promoting rap albums. As such, it never quite works as a cohesive statement. But anyone expecting a world-conquering classic like UGK's 1996 Ridin' Dirty is demanding too much. II Trill is a solid and occasionally great record, an album more directed toward car-stereo utility than bedroom contemplation. At this point in his career, Bun's more than earned the right to crank out records like this whenever he wants.","After UGK became one of the few truly feel-good comeback stories in rap, Pimp C's death made Bun B, for the second time in his career, a solo artist not by choice but by necessity, and he's responded with a record that greatly improves on 2005's Trill. Guests include Lil Wayne, Lupe Fiasco, David Banner, 8Ball & MJG, Killer Mike, Mike Jones, and Pimp C.

Live at the Royal Albert Hall,The Cinematic Orchestra,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b620b1335d7bf169a9ea/1:1/w_160/3521c8a1.jpg,2008-05-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11508-live-at-the-royal-albert-hall/,Ninja Tune,"This album makes me feel old: last time I rember there being a Live at Royal Albert Hall, it came from Spiritualized, less than a year off the strength of their American breakthrough. If you were in my freshman dorm in 1998, well, I don't apologize for trying to push Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space on you. And now, a decade later, Cinematic Orchestra has their very own Live at the Royal Albert Hall less than a year removed from their American breakthrough: an episode of ""Grey's Anatomy"" that had my fiancée asking if I had an mp3 of ""To Build a Home"". This album might make *you * feel old, too: when you take into account the kind of stuff Cinematic Orchestra did before Ma Fleur on Ninja Tune (not to mention Portishead's Third), you might start thinking that there's enough seedlings for a trip-hop revival, the sorta-genre that was roundly mocked even when it supposedly existed. Though they only got started in the late 1990s, they still kinda fit in-- if you're unfamiliar with these guys, they're possibly the easiest band to review because their two most fitting adjectives are contained within the band name itself. And while this serves as a decent, but unbalanced (in terms of album representation) Cinematic Orchestra sampler, it's also a throwback to the downtempo lifestyle music that labels were all too happy to throw cash at in the post-Dummy sweepstakes. And I don't think I need to remind you that for every ""6 Underground"", you got Formica Blues five times over. Portishead is actually worth keeping in mind, since they made a similar release with PNYC: Roseland NYC Live, a curtain-revealing look at a band previously known for its hermetic nature and shying away from concert performance. No expense was spared-- leader Jason Swinscoe outfitted Cinematic Orchestra with an army of vocalists, a 24-piece orchestra, and a venue that arguably belies their profile. It's an unyieldingly classy recording, its rich and sparkling tone impervious to shitty earbuds, car stereos, and computer speakers. Play it on a high-class hi-fi and gold coins will shoot out of your speakers. This is particularly true of the jazzier numbers; ""Child Song"" shifts from 7/4 to 5/4 without making a big fuss about it, and Swinscoe's DJing is seamlessly incorporated towards the end. ""Man With the Movie Camera"" doesn't fare quite as well, even though there's a pretty neat drum solo in the middle, as well as some free-time horn/turntablism noise providing the most avant-garde moment. But it's hard to recommend multiple listens with its forbidding, nearly 12-minute run time. Live would've been just fine as opulent sonic wallpaper, but the reason Ma Fleur was such a bore is even more pronounced in this form, in particular, Swinscoe's choice of vocalists. Surprisingly enough, his calling card gets the most subtle seasoning; the studio version of ""To Build a Home"" felt like the result of Swinscoe stuck off the realness of I Am a Bird Now and thinking, ""piece of piss, how hard could it be?"" Here, it's stripped of most of the soppy melodrama and turned into something that approaches Astral Weeks in terms of pastoral acoustic and sympathetic string use (not to mention, a bit of ramble). But otherwise, Swinscoe has the unfortunate preference for full-blast divas. You know, the type where merely singing ""How near?"" isn't enough when you could say ""HOW NEAR? hownearhownearhownearhownear"" in an overly dramatic melisma. Swinscoe has unsurprisingly gone on record saying how each of their songs is supposed to accompany an unwritten movie, but the vocal numbers tend to be both slight and overbearing; a film with this much telegraphed emotion would be impossible to stomach for even the most chick-flick hardened. Not that it's ever unpleasant on record, but goddamn-- doesn't this make you feel old? Used to be this sort of thing (trip-hop or not) was meant to accompany druggy sex or sexy drugs, or at the very least, some sort of noir danger or last-call malaise. At this point, it's the new soundtrack to cocktail hour, and everyone's the designated driver.","Ornamented with an army of vocalists and a 24-piece orchestra, this trip-hop outfit has assembled an unyieldingly classy live recording that nonetheless hints at some fundamental problems.

Desert Crossroads,Etran Finatawa,by: D. Shawn Bosler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b61f13d197565213ad9f/1:1/w_160/151e2811.jpg,2008-05-29 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11507-desert-crossroads/,Riverboat,"Desert Crossroads couldn't be a more apt title for Niamey, Niger's Etran Finatawa. This sextet's potent, trance-y ""nomadic blues"" is a blend of two West-Central African ethnic groups-- the Tuareg and the Wodaabe peoples-- who historically have lived in the south Sahara and Sahel grasslands. The band itself is a crossroad, not only in its novel and successful attempt at mixing the two distinct musical strains (vocals are in the Wodaabe style while the pronounced guitar and hand-drum grooves are steeped in Tuareg rhythms), but also since the group features three representatives from each tribe. Etran Finatawa represent two groups that have both traditionally wandered to where the water and pastures took them, sadly not always free of conflict over these essential resources. The other obvious ""crossroads"" analogy comes in with the themes of the music which address the trials and tribulations common to both ethnic groups, primarily due to the erosion of their cultural traditions and loss of their lands. Desertification is driving many people to the cities where the old ways are being forgotten, but still longed for. Granted, this English-speaking writer couldn't glean all that from the Tamashek (Tuareg) or Fulfulde (Wodaabe) languages that Etran sing in for this sophomore release, but there is a beautiful earnestness that, even during more uptempo and joyous numbers like the circular vamp ""Amidinine"", reveals a composed seriousness. This track isn't the only one that hypnotically and repetitively explores the churning bluesy guitar spiral-- pretty much the whole record displays this signature of Kel Tamasheck (a name the Tuareg call themselves) music. These trilling, slurring, serpentine guitar lines are most prominent in the internationally-renowned Tuareg band Tinariwen, who are the reason that many Tuareg musicians made the switch to electric guitar back in the 1970s. Where Tinariwen spin their desert blues with strong rock overtones-- wah-wah on the six-string, pronounced electric bass lines-- Etran keep things more traditional. Guitars may be electric, but the tone is clean; and the infrequent bass is far less featured. Though the dexterous, cobwebbed guitars have an affinity towards contemporary Afropop, the essential throbbing drones and implied bass lines are pure blues. (One can also hear this African/American Delta blues connection in the style of Malian guitarist Ali Farka Touré.) Two songs that reveal a pronounced Wodaabe influence are ""Gaynaako"" and ""Naanaaye"". Both use call-and-response vocals-- nasally and wailing with alternately smoothly-subdued replies-- that intertwine over a pulsing, clip-clop of percussion and hand-claps (besides the polyphonic and contrapuntal vocal-style, hand-claps are key to the Wodaabe sound.) These are extremely evocative and enticing tunes rich with the melding of both tribesmen, especially considering the shifting landscape and cross-cultural exchange they borrow from, including various sub-Saharan cultures, West African influences, Berber, Arabic, and even the subtle hint of contemporary Western rock. Afropop fans and world music buffs wishing to broaden their palette should experience Etran's genius musical nomadism.","This sextet's potent nomadic blues is a blend of two West-Central African ethnic groups-- the Tuareg and the Wodaabe peoples-- who historically have lived in the south Sahara and Sahel grasslands.

Lay It Down,Al Green,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6299d034d5c69bf514e/1:1/w_160/d5443274.jpg,2008-05-29 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11515-lay-it-down/,EMI,"If somebody's going to make some money from an album that sounds like this, it might as well be Al Green himself. The Greatest Living Soul Singer is 62 years old now, and age has thickened his voice, but miraculously hasn't damaged it much; he's still got immaculate power and control, all the way up to that extraordinary falsetto. In fact, he sounds better this time than on his last few albums: less short of breath, getting texture out of the slighty worn patches in his range instead of trying to cover them up with shouting (aside from the throwaway closer ""Standing in the Rain""). The production team (and half of the band) is the Roots' Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson and James Poyser, who manage to evoke the supple groove of Green's early-70s collaborations with producer Willie Mitchell more precisely than Mitchell himself did on 2003's * I Can't Stop* and 2005's Everything's OK. The arrangements, the mix, Poyser's Hammond organ tone, ?uest's drumming, the string sweetening-- everything is pure second-term-Nixon sound. (The horn section is the Dap-Kings Horns, who may be the only people who've maintained that particular tradition.) Even the major-minor changeups in a bunch of the songs are the same trick Green and Mitchell pulled off on songs like ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"". So be it: the great Al Green records all sound like this, and the less great ones don't, so by inference making an Al Green record that evokes 1973 gives it a better shot. Put it on in the background and it's as gorgeous as Let's Stay Together or Livin' for You. But there's something unsettlingly nostalgic and hollow about Lay It Down that comes to the surface when you listen closely to it. The problem isn't just that there's no sign that hip-hop ever happened, aside from ?uestlove's breakbeat-inflected drumming in ""You've Got the Love I Need"" and the slightly Fugees-oid groove of ""Stay With Me (By the Sea)"". Despite the guest shots by Green disciples Anthony Hamilton and John Legend, both of whom get shown up by the master, this isn't a neo-soul record, it's a straight old-school soul record. The hole in the middle of the album is, in fact, Jesus-shaped. Green's Christianity was always an enormous presence in his music, even before he gave up secular singing for a while; his constant awareness of mortality and divinity is what raised the stakes on his love songs. His best album, Call Me, followed ""You Ought to Be With Me"" with ""Jesus Is Waiting"", and the ever-present tension between the sacred and the secular on his records came to a head on 1977's ""Belle"": ""It's you that I want, but it's Him that I need"". There's none of that here-- the closest Green comes is singing about ""a love divine"" on ""Too Much"", and he doesn't really mean ""divine."" Instead, we get flabby romantic couplets (""You're the best thing I ever had/ Losing you, that would make me feel so bad""; ""Your love is more than true, oh baby/ It's just, it's just for me and you""). There's no desire here for a person (or a God) that Green wants to bring closer to himself, just an appreciation of someone he's already got. Yes, it's a pleasure to hear Green articulate romantic satisfaction, and good for him if he's satisfied. But the grain and pull of his voice is all about longing for both flesh and spirit, and it doesn't quite fit here. Green's classic records were never just baby-making music, and without a context greater than a shared bedroom, this precise reconstruction of their sound is a ritual that's lost a lot of its meaning.","Producers and session players Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson and James Poyser of the Roots team with The Greatest Living Soul Singer and manage to evoke the supple groove of Al Green's early-70s classics.

This Is Not the World,The Futureheads,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b656c0084474cd0c2590/1:1/w_160/71721af9.jpg,2008-05-29 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11556-this-is-not-the-world/,Nul,"When 2006's News & Tributes, with its restless genre-surfing and morose aura, didn't move units, 679 dropped the Futureheads, who in turn eagerly started their own label, Nul Recordings. Now, unbound from the shackles of corporate pressure, the Sunderland band finally has a chance to spread its wings, to enjoy the sort of creative freedom artists like Radiohead or NIN have relished, to boldly chase its muse to the ends of the earth. Ladies and gentlemen, the Futureheads present This Is Not the World, an...economy-size power-pop album? Apparently the backlash from Tributes hasn't scared the band away from penning three-minute pop standards; it's only convinced them to package their songs in a neater, more cohesive fashion. Miffed by Tributes' acoustic guitar sighs and less-than-syncopated textures? Well, World force-feeds the listener with one heaping helping of homogeneous overdriven riffs and fist-pumping choruses after another. The vocals similarly raise the stakes, broadening their focus from the tearfully quotidian to blistering anthems attacking society on the whole, likely a byproduct of their recent career shakeup. Opener ""The Beginning of the Twist"" may ostensibly refer to a romantic relationship, but Barry Hyde's rallying cry (""It's time to wake up/ It's time to change"") feels like snarky self-commentary, foreshadowing the in-your-face persona the band's adopted on World. Since their self-titled debut, the Futureheads have gone from crafting intricate, mathematical post-punk with a pop edge to crafting full-blown power-pop with a hint of Elvis Costello/Ric Ocasek geek chic. Missing here are most of the Wire and XTC signifiers and the ADD songwriting that fired off one robotic riff after another with Pentium processor precision, verse/chorus structure be damned. The sweeping power chords of songs like ""Think Tonight"" and the title track will betray nearly every preconception you've had of this band. Not only do these tracks stick to conventional song structures, they even go as far as to anticipate their massive sing-along refrains with dramatic intros and pre-choruses. I haven't checked, but it's likely many of these songs, especially the handful with avalanche-style descending major scale riffs, synch up eerily well with Cheap Trick's ""Surrender"". Fortunately, just because the hooks are swollen doesn't mean they're not catchy as hell. While neither as frenetic as the group's debut or as stylistically curious as Tributes, World boasts smart pop sensibilities all the same. ""Broke Up the Time"" is an unashamed carousel ride around an ultra-sunny riff, not any more guilty than a tongue-in-cheek song like R.E.M.'s ""Stand"". ""Sale of the Century"" grinds down a herky-jerky Go4 groove until it's as palatable as a harmless Franz Ferdinand ditty, while standout track ""Radio Heart"" represents the best possible outcome for the band's new artistic direction. Pinching the meaty guitar slabs from 2006 single ""Skip to the End"", the track's skewed chord progression and galloping melody make for three minutes of near pop perfection, replete with a Pygmalion-esque confluence of art and love, ""a girl with a radio heart."" Hyde's lyrics are especially gripping considering how his band's toils somewhere between abstract, cerebral post-punk and mainstream rock, never quite mortgaging one for greater success in the other. The sad truth, though, is that the Futureheads were never a band that got by solely on hooks, but rather their unorthodox delivery of them. Aside from their endearing Sunderland accents, they've 86'd every ace previously kept up their sleeve. Without the quad-approved a cappella harmonies, explosive stop-start melodies, and edge-of-seat rhythms, these guys can't distinguish themselves quite so clearly from the UK's post-punk hoi polloi anymore. Maybe it's just the subliminal suggestion of the group's moniker, or a revisionist nostalgia for their debut's slap-in-the-face urgency, but World feels sadly complacent coming from a band that once wielded so much restless, forward-thinking innovation. Hopefully the plodding nature of this album means the band's simply stabilizing after some label turmoil, and not, as the weakest parts of World suggest, already running on empty.","After parting ways with 679 Recordings, the Futureheads eagerly started their own label, Nul Recordings, and have released this economy-size power-pop album.

Songs on the Rocks,Nôze,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6219d034d5c69bf5146/1:1/w_160/aa2ad82c.jpg,2008-05-29 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11509-songs-on-the-rocks/,Get Physical,"Common sense dictates never to trust techno that's aimed as much for the pub as it is for the club, and thus we are to be skeptical of Nicolas Sfintescu and Ezechiel Pailhès, the absurdist duo behind Nôze. Their first couple of records, while leaning just on this side of minimal tech-house, always shuffled in and out of drunk-step, taking nonsensical barroom lyrics and mixing them in with various jazz-inflected reed instruments, steam-machine hi-hats, and pounding basslines. On Craft Sounds and Voices and 2006's How To Dance, it's never quite clear whether they're poised cosmopolitan producers or just a drink away from Gainsbourg-hitting-on-Whitney-Houston. Early last year, their Remember Love 12"" dropped and signaled a move even further out of the club, the pulse of a deep house groove pummeled into a piano line, an effete yet fully-formed song about fucking around on your sig-oh. The piano figures heavily on Songs on the Rocks, almost to the point of parody, but this is still as complete an artist album as any released on Get Physical in recent memory. Those stylistic tweaks employed for the sake of ""songiness"" on ""Remember Love"" have been blueprinted into long form, with pianos and guitars filling the timbral space once gobbled up by synthesized squelches and samples; actual verse-chorus-verse dynamic shifts and turn-of-the-century French folk play themselves out into the ether of minimal beats. Nico and Ezechiel have always gotten off on contributing their own singsong vocals, but they've gone from adding simple hooks and vocal grooves to penning fully-formed lyrics. Nico utilizes a peculiar cabaret growl (made popular elsewhere by Man Man's Honus Honus or Tom Waits) whenever he wrests control of the mic, but otherwise the two harmonize catchy little ditties in their awkward French-accented lilts. Immediately following the timpani-driven beats (!!) of ""L'Inconnu Du Placard"", the pair also bring some star power into ""Danse Avec Moi"" in the form of Dani Siciliano's duet with French singer David Lafore on a piano laced techno-tango. It certainly seems like Nôze chose the right time to aim for accessibility. They've gained more than their share of exposure lately due to the DJ-Kicks series, having been featured on back-to-back mixes by Hot Chip and Booka Shade. The latter features this record's ""Slum Girl"", but as is often the case with DJ-Kicks, Booka Shade make a happy decision of taste in editing out Nico's vocals. Here's the problem: ""Slum Girl"" as Booka Shade sees it is a dramatic, expansive orchestral work, one that in their hands recalls the vivacious cinematic minimalism of Alain Goraguer's score to the classic animated sci-fi film La Planète Sauvage. To Nico, it's a vehicle for him to growl a double of the guitar line, in effect lessening the impact of the composition. Nico better services the classic rock postures of ""Childhood Blues"", where it's actually appropriate to invoke the self-effacing impotence of British blues-rock. A short, balladized take on How To Dance's ""Kitchen"" closes the record, fittingly distilling the original's hard-partying, come-hither hoedown into a refreshing stab at solemnity. Of course, they're singing ""I'll make you come/ All night long,"" but then, actual gravitas might be asking too much. Because while they may be the jet-setting, free lovin' Frenchmen they want everyone to think they are, their song-based oeuvre seems even more suited to pounding a night out at the local 17th District dive than wooing high-class sophisticates. Either way, you'll just have to trust them.",,6.7,
Everything's the Rush,Delays,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6135e6ef959693228a6/1:1/w_160/87f6d03c.jpg,2008-05-28 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11494-everythings-the-rush/,PolydorFiction,"There are worse fates for sure, but Delays ultimately are a band that's far easier to love than to take seriously. Faded Seaside Glamour and You See Colours were overlooked albums of gorgeous, sun-stroked pop that was equally informed by dance and shoegaze, often and rather accurately likened to a Cocteaus/La's crossbreed. But there's so much about them that comes across as earnest to the point of unintentional silliness-- in no particular order, their videos, their lyrics, and their haircuts. And even if Greg Gilbert's voice is an astonishing instrument, he sounds like a woman half the time, and when he tries to grit it up in the lower registers, he suspiciously sounds like a Bonus Jonas. That's actually relevant to the discussion, because I used to wonder how ""Valentine"" or ""Hey Girl"" could fall under the radar in the golden age of Poptimism, when grown men are falling over themselves trying to unearth the ""genius"" in Disney pop outside of its marketing. But after hearing ""When You Look Me In The Eyes"" while getting my hair cut and then ""One More Lie In"" and ""Keep It Simple"" in the car immediately afterwards... well, the two might actually be playing the same game at this point. Bet you can't tell which is penning these lyrics: ""I love you/ I'll pick the leaves from trees above you."" ""I know what haunts you/ And you need to know I want you."" ""You need to try today/ Because these things don't go away."" Where the Cocteaus looked to obscure, the brothers Gilbert makes themselves fully intelligible*,* and at Everything's The Rush's worst, you get wincing simulacra of 1990s ""sell out"" pop ballads whose sheer inanity was tough to anticipate even when Delays were at their corniest. Everything's The Rush provides convenient scapegoats, specifically the decision to let keyboardist Aaron Gilbert sing; I'll stop short of namedropping CCR's Mardi Gras as a comparison, but not by much. Harmonically, he's a great fit with his brother and it's hard to imagine ""Hey Girl"" or ""Nearer Than Heaven"" having got as close to the cosmos without him. But as a lead, his froggy every-bloke accent strips the band of their most distinguishing characteristic, not to mention all of the lyrics I mentioned before are his. Aaron fairs better on the clubby stomper ""Friends Are False"", but that might have to do more with Greg murdering him on his own shit once the hook kicks in. Or you can blame the guy behind the boards if you must; the majority of their past work was headed by Graham Sutton of Bark Psychosis, who always managed to make even the most synthetic of their numbers sound humble and handcrafted. For their major label debut, they recruited Youth, who's always fallen a hair shy of Bruckheimer overkill, but tellingly has enabled gargantuas of ego such as Richard Ashcroft, Liam Gallagher, and, if we're to believe the rumors, Axl Rose. Whereas the past saw the group trafficking in coy ""Do you love me? Check yes"" mash notes, too many moves here feel like the desperate begging for a last-minute prom date-- this is the rare band where real strings sound less appropriate than fake ones, and while they add a nice touch to the surprisingly tender ""Pieces"", ""Touch Down"", and ""Keep It Simple"" end up sounding like Pavlovian biscuits of phony populism. But Everything's The Rush isn't without its charms even if they do surface less frequently. Along with the Rapture, they're one of the few bands that can legitimately make rock music applicable to dancefloors without the middlemen of disco remixers. ""Girl's on Fire"" and ""Friends Are False"" in particular hurtle with a heady velocity that makes their underwriting feel almost necessary. Meanwhile, knowing that ""Hooray"" is about Gilbert's OCD is about as important as knowing ""Valentine"" was supposedly about Hurricane Katrina-- which is to say, not at all. It's an overwhelming, irrepressibly cheerful refrain from a band that seems to have an endless supply of them; even ""One More Lie In"" redeems itself at its chorus. But Everything's The Rush often feels like one of those stock characters that tries to play ditzy so it can hang with the popular kids before eventually being loved for what they are. Their previous albums ensure they'll deserve it if Everything's The Rush manages to break them into a higher tax bracket; I just hope they don't see it as a mandate for more of the same.","English band that combines elements of dance and shoegaze with lead singer Greg Gilbert's otherworldly voice returns with album number three.

"""Free Gold!""",Indian Jewelry,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b625ea9e61561daa6efb/1:1/w_160/73b0d306.jpg,2008-05-28 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11512-free-gold/,We Are Free,"Indian Jewelry's debut album, Invasive Exotics, dropped at exactly the right time-- about six months after Liars' Drum's Not Dead. The album proved a worthy footnote to the Year Indie Rock Cared About Tribal-y Drone-y Things, an addendum for those not about to dig through the Einstürzende Neubauten catalog. But be exactly as skeptical of the band's sophomore album ""Free Gold!"" as you would anything bearing its title: the Houston/Chicago troupe has swallowed itself whole, submitting its already over-serious barnacle-rock to swarming electronics and pedantic sloganeering. Scattered salvations are offered via surprisingly varied songwriting, but ""Free Gold!"" contains neither the levity nor inspired anger to buoy its industrial-grade sludge. Like its predecessor, ""Free Gold!"" still sounds the product of its influences. Making a police lineup out of them isn't useful, but suffice to say Indian Jewelry probably knows what they're up to naming the lead track ""Swans"". Standard garage and trance-rock tags still apply, and while Indian Jewelry have disappointingly phased out their grooves there's plenty variety to be had: dangling guitar-pop, West Coast psychedelia, ambient blissout. But Indian Jewelry seem to relish applying a layer of gristle and fat to each of these styles, heaping on distended guitar, buzzkill synths, and all other manner of electronic distraction that generally sounds like a cloud of mosquitoes blotting out the sun. Add to this a newfound love of chant and Indian Jewelry zero out most of their versatility before it has a chance to show. The mantras range from the relatively harmless ""That bird is broke/ That bird won't sing"" to the outright bizarre and, more pressingly, disastrous: during the croaking dirge of ""Hello Africa"" the band circles around ""Hello Africa/ Hello Af-ri-ca/ Hell Africa/ Hello Hello."" ""Too Much Honkytonking"" lives up to its title if we presume that by ""honkytonking"" the band means ""rallying around a big distorto-riff, caveman tom hits, and a virally irritating, meaningless phrase."" Later in the song the lyrics get switched up: ""Too much honky-everything,"" a turn so elementary and internet-clever the sound of your eyes rolling back in their sockets actually drowns out the succeeding bars. These fleeting successes lend credence to the idea that Indian Jewelry-- who dress in headrobes and bring rifles to their photo shoots and probably spend as much time writing press releases as lyrics-- are a much better idea than they are band. Their suffocate under the specter of momentless four-minute slugs like ""Walking on the Water"" and ""Seasonal Economy"". Someone should buy Indian Jewelry better drugs, or perhaps funner drugs, or maybe just a Calvin and Hobbes collection: something, anything to ensure that someone cracks a smile during the band’s next recording session. Or more importantly, the next time someone listens to their record because ""Free Gold!"" is entirely too weighted, emotionally and sonically.","On its sophomore album, the tribal/drone indie band offer a mixed bag of dangling guitar-pop, West Coast psychedelia, and ambient blissout, among other sounds.

The Set Up,Fat RayBlack Milk,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b623b1335d7bf169a9f3/1:1/w_160/4039a15d.jpg,2008-05-28 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11511-the-set-up/,Music House,"Like Ford trucks, Detroit beatmaker/MC Black Milk uses dependability as a selling point. His 2007 debut, By Popular Demand, was one of the year's most consistent, if not terribly innovative, rap records, and he's arguably the brightest star in the post-Dilla Fat Beats/Stones Throw constellation; you'd be hard-pressed to find a wack beat with his name attached to it. However, there was something of a telling moment thrown into the extravagant instrumentation of ""Luvin' It"", namely Milk uttering, ""This is the shit I wanna make, man."" Since major-label hip-hop is about as financially stable as mixed martial arts or original internet programming, even the bigger names have gone underground, but is the basement getting too crowded? Like most producer/MC double-bills, The Set Up traffics in lowered expectations so as to let either party go off on a tangent that might otherwise be considered too curveball on a real release. For those looking for Popular-er Demand, Milk lays out his cards in quick fashion-- the wildly flanged ""Lookout"" comes out of nowhere, a Diwali-ish club rumbler straight off of So Addictive (albeit without a particularly sturdy hook). It's even more glaring sandwiched between the relentless Ironman boom of ""Flawless"" and ""Bad Man"", so mid-1990s, you probably need to wear 40 Below Timbs and Triple Fat Goose just to fully appreciate it. From there on out, it's more along the lines of what we've come to expect from one of the most tireless producers working right now: weeping soul samples (""Nothing To Hide""), dusty breakbeats, the occasional string loop, the Foreign Exchange-on-HGH of ""Take Control""-- it all sounds pretty fantastic. What ties most of these tracks together is Milk's shattering, presently anomalous drum work. Be honest with yourself; between Kanye West popularizing chamber pop and European club techno and the prominence of southern synth merchants, when was the last time you heard a drum track knock? But if there was a reason why Popular Demand was really good instead of great, it's an issue of what some would call consistency and the more skeptical listeners would call complacency. Maybe it's just projection on my part, but there seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy of ""real hip-hop"" superiority due to the mere fact that they're rappin' on Music House about something other than the sort of topics that are deemed taboo on Okayplayer. Though clearly ambitious behind the boards, Milk and nearly everyone else don't seem all that interested in challenging themselves lyrically or revealing what makes them tick other than a metronome. Clocking in at nearly 40 minutes, The Set Up was likely meant as snack food, but as much as it can sate the listener, its impact doesn't last very long beyond the tantalizing proposition of what more versatile rhymers could've done with it. In terms of flow, the main characters are certainly nice with theirs: Milk can be likened to Kanye with baggier clothes, and as for Fat Ray, he sounds like someone who learned the craft by listening to Re-Up Gang tapes and fast-forwarding through the Clipse. But whether it's coke puns or B+ battle raps, refusing to ever leave your comfort zone can only result in diminishing returns. The two are hardly subpar on the mic, but they stay in cruise control to the point where you only notice the speed bumps (mostly coming from Fat Ray)-- ""better make room like Fiddy's crib,"" ""we don't smoke squares, n***a-- rectangles,"" ""you see how we stack chips like Chester Cheetah."" Taken as a full experience, The Set Up ends up as a great beat tape and a pretty good full experience that, in a sneaky way, seems to dismiss the talents of the people involved. While Guilty Simpson does a pretty good job of roughing up his sixteen bars on ""Bad Man"", Beanie Sigel might've dug 'em a deep grave. What about finding the cave MF Doom is hiding in to lace up the syrupy keys on ""When It Goes Down""? There's more than enough in Black Milk's track record that justifies him wanting to work with the best and having the best seek him out. And he may just be a part of something truly great in the future, but he'll have to decide whether his name will be on the spine or in the credits.","Like Ford trucks, J Dilla-influenced beatmaker/MC Black Milk uses dependability as a selling point. Here he hooks up for an album with fellow Detroit MC Fat Ray.

Dominique Leone,Dominique Leone,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b64cea9e61561daa6f4e/1:1/w_160/9fb63b48.jpg,2008-05-28 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11546-dominique-leone/,Stromland,"There are two ways of looking at Dominique Leone: as an electronic artist obsessed with pop music, or a pop musician with a serious tech fetish. What makes his debut full-length so appealing is that it matches both descriptions. Leone mixes crafty melody with digital wizardry so smoothly, it's hard to say where one side of his musical personality ends and the other begins. A frequent rock critic (primarily for Pitchfork), Leone has wide range in both taste and background (his press kit calls him ""classically trained""). But Dominique Leone doesn't sound like a collection of influences, a sampling of references, or a compendium of ideas. It's impressively organic, with detailed compositions that neither hide artifice nor flaunt it. Leone seems to have eyes in the back of his head, watching pop history while pushing it forward. The pop history Leone prefers could roughly be described as groups infatuated with sugary melodies, and using the studio to craft and enhance them. Think Beatles, Beach Boys, and ELO, up through Todd Rundgren, XTC, and ABBA. But Leone's buoyant tunes and high-pitched voice are more than mimicry. For every song that sounds like Pet Sounds or Skylarking, there's one that conjures less-predictable comparisons. I often hear the helium-injected whine of Mark Davies of Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 in Leone's singing, and other listeners will find their own touchstones, making Dominique Leone a kind of electro-pop mood ring whose day-glo hues change with each listen. Leone opens the album with a few seconds of his voice run backwards. This might be the only instance where his singing stands alone-- usually he buries it under layers of sound and processing. But his voice is the center of each tune, and it allows him to make active mixes that never get overly busy, since they're always based on simple vocal melodies. On the delirious ""Sim"", hyper synths whir past his chorused croons, while in ""Duyen"" radio samples and ringing phones rhyme with his Jeff Lynne-style hums. The effect is often funny, and even goofy-- take the most contagious piece, ""Nous Tombons Dans Elle"", which sounds like a club track, a Dr. Demento remix, and a Japanese TV ad rolled into one. There are also moments of noise and abstraction, reflecting Leone's love of figures as divergent as Debussy, Harry Nilsson, and the Boredoms. Still, the majority of Dominique Leone is sunny pop, and as such suffers a bit from over-consistency. The brightness can become a blinding glare-- skip randomly around the album and it's hard to remember which tune is which. But if the cost of hearing Leone hone his fertile musical approach is a little tedium, that's a fair price to pay. Especially when the reward is the album-ending ""Conversational"", an aching Beatles-esque ballad that serves as an open-ended farewell on a record worth staying in touch with.","Longtime rock critic (particularly for Pitchfork) mixes crafty melody with digital wizardry on his debut LP, released via Lindstrøm's Stromland label.

Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP,Mount Eerie,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b64bb1335d7bf169aa2d/1:1/w_160/05e7ff65.jpg,2008-05-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11545-black-wooden-ceiling-opening-ep/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,"Pacific Northwest musician and artist Phil Elverum, aka Mount Eerie, writes around tactile sensations. In his better incarnation, Microphones, song titles such as ""The Pull"", ""I Felt Your Shape"", ""Ice"", and ""Sand (Eric's Trip)"" conjure elements of motion and texture. Those were songs with seasick dynamics: booms and flicks; hard, lumbering drums; and Elverum's soft voice. Willful amateurism is the other defining characteristic of Elverum's career, in ways both admirable (the care and dedication he shows in packaging and releasing his own material) and silly (this EP comes with a bootleg of the track list, played live, and captured by a tape recorder held up to a PA). Sometimes that amateurism has given off the distinct impression that Elverum's not trying very hard, but he's had plenty of bright spots, too. This release is one of them. Black Wooden Ceiling Opening is the first of Elverum's experiments in ""black metal using natural materials."" Despite his claims to genre-hopping, this six-song EP isn't so different from his other releases. For one thing, three of the tracks have seen light on other albums, though in different forms (something he also attempted in 2005 when he reworked songs on ""Singers""). But even the new tracks fit his discography, though with mealier textures and darker tones. The album's best track is one of the older ones. ""Don't Smoke""-- originally released on a limited 7""-- makes good on its title: Elverum doesn't want you to smoke. Though his argument is sincere, his reasons are a bit flimsy: You smoke because ""there's a little part of you that wants to be dead"" or maybe because ""the rebellion against the adults hasn't ended yet."" The guitar is more furious than his pleas, and it's the tension and crash of the music that make this the EP's standout. ""Blue Light on the Floor"" is another makeover. The first version, from 2007's Mount Eerie Pts. 6 & 7, shimmers and flexes; cymbals and low organ drones ebb and flow behind his voice. The Black Wooden Ceiling Opening version eschews scenery for action and powerful exhales of gut-rumbling distortion. There are some real, menacingly fast intakes of breath from Elverum, too, which reinforce the aggression. And the double-tracked vocals fit the song's muscular makeover more than they do the earlier version, which ends with the same gruff textures that you'll find on Black Wooden Ceiling Opening. Maybe Elverum had planned this version from the beginning. Plain, literal, naked, on closer ""Stop Singing"" Elverum sings: ""If I stopped bellowing my voice in the void/ I would notice songs that all around me sing."" Like a smoker, Elverum's compulsion to keep going trumps his own best interests-- when he recognizes that compulsion is when he's at his best, though his recent output hasn't topped his Microphones work. But Elverum's experiment is less about moving forward than mulling over. Restlessness or laziness, who knows. But as Mount Eerie, he can rework his material in a way that makes it meatier but still tactile, more aggressive yet as emotionally understated and gentle as his voice.","Phil Elverum's latest, a six-song EP in part made of reworked older material, is a bright spot in a sometimes scattered discography.

Imaginational Anthem Vol. 3,Various Artists,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b62bc0084474cd0c2547/1:1/w_160/bcc08ce8.jpg,2008-05-27 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11517-imaginational-anthem-vol-3/,Tompkins Square,"Released in 2005 to widespread acclaim, the first volume of Tompkins Square's series Imaginational Anthem stands as a high-water mark of the contemporary American Primitive guitar movement. Since that collection's release, the deluge of fingerpicked guitar records has continued unabated, and Tompkins Square has become the sort of magnet for talented guitarists that John Fahey's legendary Takoma label once was. A second Imaginational Anthem compilation arrived in 2006, and several of the series' alumni-- including James Blackshaw, Jack Rose, Glenn Jones, and José González-- have since each released multiple solo albums across a variety of labels. At the same time there has also arrived a bounty of unearthed 1960s-era folk guitar albums, including Tompkins Square's own reissues of seminal works by Robbie Basho and Harry Taussig. The American Primitive market therefore is as flooded as it has ever been, and even the most diehard guitar aficionados can afford to be pretty goddamn choosy. So due to the timing of its arrival-- and thanks in no small part to Tompkins Square's own success at making so much top-flight guitar music available-- the new Imaginational Anthem Vol. 3 bravely risks redundancy as it returns once again to the seemingly inexhaustible folk-guitar wellspring. As with the first two volumes in the series, label chief Josh Rosenthal has curated IA3 with a loving, handcrafted touch, gathering artists from both past and present to construct an informal timeline for the music and its traditions. While past editions have included rare cuts from genre pioneers like Fahey, Sandy Bull, and Robbie Basho, this collection places focus on a broad cross-section of lesser-known performers. The set features guitarists from around the globe, including Steffan Basho-Junghans (Germany) , Cian Nugent (Ireland), Ben Reynolds (UK), as well as players from virtually every corner of America. Despite this globetrotting, there are frustratingly few actual regional variations in evidence, as the musicians seem to draw upon the same familiar Takoma-derived pool of folk, bluegrass, and raga influences. So much so, in fact, that even after repeat listens it is challenging to recognize each track's performer or point of origin without assistance from Rosenthal's informative liner notes. Of course, with this many exceptional musicians on board there are still some stellar performances here, and with a slightly more adventurous tilt than on past volumes. The virtual unknown Richard Crandell, who also appeared on the Numero Group's recent rarities collection Wayfaring Strangers: Guitar Soli, opens the album with the exquisite ""Zocalo"". This melodic piece, which echoes the British folk of John Renbourn or Wizz Jones, is one of the most lucid and addictive guitar tracks of recent memory. (And in case it hasn't yet been made clear, there's been a bunch of them.) Frequent Keith Fullerton Whitman collaborator Greg Davis contributes the mesmeric ""Sleep Architecture"", whose gentle dreamwaves are eventually resolved in a disorienting swirl of field recordings and tape effects. Most arresting of all might be George Stavis' ""Goblins"", a thorny work for five-string banjo that was originally cut for his 1969 Vanguard album Labyrinths. Packed with furious action and melodic digression, this piece moves to its own infernal logic and gives the album's latter stretches a much-needed jolt of energy. Elsewhere, however, there are too many tracks that illustrate the elusive challenge of finding a distinctive style in this crowded field. Shorter pieces by Nathan Salsburg and Matt Baldwin fail to establish much of a presence, while on ""Blue Mountain Raga II"" even the phenomenal Basho-Junghans spends too long fruitlessly chasing himself in circles. Despite such lapses, IA3 does add another worthy chapter to the Imaginational Anthem series, which is now also available as a box set containing all three volumes. Taken as a whole, these three albums provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing American Primitive movement, and will likely provide a large enough resevoir to tide you over handsomely should that acoustic guitar drought ever come.","The first volume of Tompkins Square's series Imaginational Anthem stands as a high-water mark of the contemporary American Primitive guitar movement.

Gods of the Earth,The Sword,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b61ec0084474cd0c2534/1:1/w_160/199e95b3.jpg,2008-05-27 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11506-gods-of-the-earth/,Kemado,"The Sword may be the reluctant avatars of metal's recent indie acceptance, but it's unclear what landed them in that position. Nothing about the High on Fire-ripping or Black Sabbath sludge of the Austin quartet's debut album Age of Winters set it apart from the pack of bands doing the same thing in 2006 (ok, maybe those supremely tough dueling guitars, but that's hardly enough, right?). And, for that matter, none of its tracks struck any metal-for-non-metalheads poses (we're looking at you, Goblin Cock). Rather, their dominion over the scene seems like something of an arbitrary media decision. Eh, we might as well pick one to speak for them all, and they're better than Priestess, so why not? The result: more praise, pressure, and criticism than deserved. But while they didn't ask for it (unless you count signing to Kemado against them), this is the Sword's hand to play. And on Gods of the Earth, the money-shot follow-up to Age of Winters, the band seems acutely aware of their position, doing everything they can to ratify the will of the people who've tossed the crown on their heads. That means bigger, louder, prouder songs, gongs, devil growls, Celtic acoustic interludes, and a lot more of the 12-sided die bullshit that got obscured by all the *Guitar Hero-*fated muck on the debut. And if that isn't a bad thing, it's certainly a silly one. Even so, strip away all the aesthetic boosting, and much like Winters, Gods is a straight-forward metal record, content to rattle off wide-load riffs with recognizable Tolkien-style imagery as the backdrop. The usual suspects are all here: Frost Giants, Axes, Fire Lances, Black Rivers, White Seas, and whatever the hell a Hyperzephyrian is. For the most part, the goblin gobbledygook works. And when singer/guitarist J.D. Cronise doesn't take the D&D punchlining overboard, he and Kyle Shutt's riffs are downright Herculean. But dig any deeper than the surface, and it's real fish-in-a-barrel sort of stuff. Dueling weedles. Halftime section. Galloping drums. Yippee. For the most part, it's all the same old bong-thrash, save for the record's one non-heavy trick: English-jig folk. Or more accurately, the happy Hobbit stuff that heavy metal's been crushing on for ages. The Sword use it twice, on the album's centerpiece, ""To Take the Black"", and the nameless hidden track that closes things out. On one level, it's a smart move, breaking up the monotony and adding something new to the sludgy stew. On another-- like the cheesy growl tucked in the middle of ""Lords"" and the ridiculously indulgent gong that peppers ""Fire Lances of the Hyperzephyrians""-- it further dilutes the potency of an album that loses a lot of its directness in trying to fill the wrong shoes.","On the follow-up to debut album Age of Winters, the Sword seem acutely aware of their indie-metal tag, doing everything they can to ratify the will of the people who tossed that crown on their heads in the first place.

El Rey,The Wedding Present,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b648ea9e61561daa6f48/1:1/w_160/d288bcf0.jpg,2008-05-27 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11543-el-rey/,Vibrant,"If gossip of about Wedding Present frontman David Gedge is to be believed, the demise of Cinerama and the consequent revival of the Wedding Present was due to a falling out with Sally Murrell, his longtime girlfriend and bandmate. (Ostensibly, Cinerama's sound had ""changed"" so much it didn't sound like Cinerama anymore--polite way of saying that furious breakup anthems and the recounting of subsequent one-night stands didn't fit into Cinerama's dinner jacket and domestic bliss agenda; fortunately, these just happened to be the exact subjects the Wedding Present has specialized in for over 20 years.) Perhaps not coincidentally, the Wedding Present got its own start, back in 1985, after the drummer of Gedge's first outfit, the Lost Pandas, left him for the band's guitarist. It's romantic comedy with the crucial caveat that Gedge almost never thinks any of it is remotely funny. For those keeping score, El Rey is the band's eighth album, not counting a bunch of compilations, singles, and reissues, and its second with Steve Albini, who recorded Seamonsters with the band back in 1991. Albini was, for a band whose guitars were revved way past the well-mannered C86 group-hug they were then associated with, the right guy for the job; in his own way, he probably chipped in as much as John Peel in terms of separating the band from all the other shambling, earnest, indie pop acts in England at the time. There's still nothing really like Seamonsters-- quick, skipping rhythm tracks, flurries of drums, terse, spilling builds, and total thematic unity in the vein of embattled love. 2005's Take Fountain, with its Cinerama hangover, its tentative trip back into the dating pool, was nowhere near as ferocious. El Rey, Gedge's self-described return to ""lust, jealousy, betrayal, regret, obsession,"" and, um, ""superheroes,"" is the band's first in a while to give the Seamonsters-era another go. El Rey is an L.A. record of sorts, written and recorded after a sojourn there, and Gedge-- a cynical, conniving, desperate, charming, and above all unquenchable male approaching 50-- picked a funny age at which to go. There's some incomprehension. There are some lonely nights. There is a lot of temptation, more infidelity, and some exceedingly difficult conquests. ""I thought women were supposed to tell you how they're feeling,"" Gedge says, bewildered, on ""Palisades"". ""But you're really the most unrevealing."" Whoever she is, she doesn't love him, and in some dark hour this fact results in ""Model, Actress, Whatever..."", an ode, it seems, to internet pornography: ""When I stare at you-- OK, it's just a .jpeg: I have a few."" The virile Gedge of the early 90s might be horrified at this, but there's something entertaining (also, without a doubt, authentic) about his randy uncle frustrations. There are flashes of refinement: the anthemic, sample-and-guitar-feedback collage that begins ""The Thing I Like Best About Him is His Girlfriend"", for instance. And then there are the up-market descendants of Cinerama songs, arch and playful, e.g. the tambourine-heavy and feedback-free second half of the same song, a duet with bassist Terry de Castro. But mostly, it's the same old bereaved roar: ""Santa Ana Winds"", chugging in like a Black Sabbath track, one big ominously bassy, upward, awkward, frustrated arc that ends in infidelity, natch. Whoever she is, she's gone by ""Spider-Man on Hollywood"", which works a jangly guitar and a pretty backing vocal into a metaphor about seeing things-- flying saucers, shooting stars, a girl who'll stick around-- that don't exist. On whispery crooner ""The Trouble with Men"" Gedge agonizes about his own roving eye; over ""Swingers""'s light bossa nova, Gedge stand-in de Castro accuses a girlfriend of the same, ""like Bridget Bardot in ...And God Created Woman."" Gedge evidently has been at the cable TV lately. ""Soup"", a cad's tale about a one-night stand that will not result in a phone call the next day, breaks the news via ""Seinfeld"": ""No soup for you!"" That one's a little bit much, and for a guy who's been doing pretty much the same thing for a few decades now, syndication is probably not an idea he wants to be bringing up. El Rey has its share of surprises, mostly in the vein of its particular subject, which is the cruelty older men visit on younger women, and vice versa. But mostly it's merely another Wedding Present record: witty, randy, guitar-heavy, and not quite satisfied.","David Gedge here reunites with Steve Albini, who engineed the Weddoes' 1991 album Seamonster, and the resulting record echoes that album's terse, quick sound.

Lie Down in the Light,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b64fc0084474cd0c2582/1:1/w_160/04dfd16d.jpg,2008-05-27 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11549-lie-down-in-the-light/,Drag City,"Dependable isn't a glamorous adjective for a musician, and reliability doesn't sell a lot of records, but Will Oldham, through his arsenal of aliases, has been creating consistently good music for nearly two decades. At least once a year, he releases an album, EP, mini-LP, or collaboration-- and it's almost always worth hearing. At his worst, he drops a bomb like The Brave & the Bold, his covers album with Tortoise; at his best, as on his defining 1999 album I See a Darkness (recorded under the name Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy), he completely uproots American musical traditions. The upside is a career with an even trajectory-- rising only slightly but never falling off-- and the freedom to chase any rabbit he wants. The downsides: His albums all sell about the same; his audience, while loyal, neither grows nor dwindles; his followers (Iron & Wine, Pinetop Seven) sometimes surpass him; and his presence within indie rock generally comforts rather than excites. At first blush, the most interesting aspect of Oldham's latest album (another as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy) is its Raconteurish release strategy. Emphasizing digital downloads over jewel-cased CDs, Drag City rushed it to stores with little warning and nothing in the way of a promo blitz, bypassing critics' previews, promotional mp3s, and all the rigmarole that typically sells an indie album. Similar endeavors by more mainstream acts have yielded disappointing returns, but Oldham's audience will seek him out. And while Lie Down in the Light may not actually change his career arc, it should find a very loyal listenership beyond his fans. For such a reliable artist, Lie Down in the Light is good enough to be actually exciting, perhaps Oldham's best since Darkness, which could be its evil twin. If that 10.0-worthy record plumbed the bleakness of life, Light finds peace in the modest pleasures of friends, family, and music. ""I like the places where the night does not mean an end,"" he sings on ""You Remind Me of Something (The Glory Goes)"", ""Where smiles break free and surprise is your friend/ And dancing goes on in the kitchen until dawn/ To my favorite song that has no end."" At times on this album, Oldham sounds like he's found just that place. Musically, these meticulously crafted songs-- produced by Mark Nevers of Lambchop-- give the impression of front-porch spontaneity, their purposefulness made to sound like serendipity. Oldham mines many of the same musical veins as he has on previous albums-- these songs are heavy with old gospel, country, folk, and other Americana sounds-- but he tweaks them in new ways, adding twists and turns that even some of his most ardent fans may not expect. The free-wheeling ""Easy Does It"" opens the album with a churchly jangle in which Oldham's band (which includes mainstays Paul Oldham and Emmett Kelly, along with scads of Nashville musicians) trade solos. A Bakersfield guitar passes the plate to a barrelhouse piano, which yields to a melodica, and all the while Oldham hums like he's in a jug band. It's as if the instruments were introducing themselves so you'll recognize them in later songs, but that doesn't account for the clarinet that goes off on a wild tear on ""For Every Field There's a Mole"", adding a jazzy element that sends the song careering in a new direction, namely a rewrite of Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (""To every thing there is a season...""). Similarly, a mournful pedal steel punctuates ""You Want That Picture"", and the ambient woodwinds and percussive acoustic guitar give ""(Keep Eye on) Other's Gain"" an almost psychedelic sensibility. Lie Down may be Oldham's most country record of new songs in years, and it's also one of his most accessible and least academic records. In its loose narrative-- of a relationship forged and broken, and of lives reassured-- the Loretta Lynn to his Conway Twitty is Ashley Webber, whose full-throated, feminine roar contrasts with Oldham's old-man croon. ""So Everyone"", with its solemn horns and ratchety percussion (either a washboard or spoons), relates the excitement of new love through a plea for public oral sex, but there's neither a giggly nudge nor an admission of transgressiveness. In fact, the song sounds positively romantic. Of course, their second duet, ""You Want That Picture"", portrays a romance in shambles, each accusing the other of betrayal in a he-said/she-said dialogue. Oldham certainly sees a darkness, but Lie Down ends basking in holy light. A Baptist organ illuminates the hymnlike closer ""I'll Be Glad"", a paean to God's own reliability. As it reaches its final refrain, a full choir joins Oldham for a few short, sweet chords that serve as a sort of benediction. Coming at the end of an album full of moral, romantic, and sexual gray areas, those closing notes sound genuinely redemptive-- not just a preordained conclusion, but a powerful and hard-won finale. If Lie Down in the Light sounds like the distillation of the themes and sounds Oldham has been tinkering with throughout his career, the result, as he sings on ""Easy Does It"", is ""good earthly music singing into my head.""","Will Oldham's latest could be the evil twin of the singer/songwriter's career peak, 1999's I See a Darkness: If that 90s record plumbed the bleakness of life, Lie Down in the Light finds peace in the modest pleasures of friends, family, and music.

Shine,Estelle,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d99d034d5c69bf2a5d/1:1/w_160/d677c4dc.jpg,2008-05-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11498-shine/,Atlantic,"The recent spate of solo English females gaining a foothold on U.S. charts (Lily Allen, Lady Sovereign, and Amy Winehouse) seems to indicate that Yanks have a higher tolerance for acidity when it's delivered with an accent. Rather than merely standing their ground in the battle of the sexes, these ladies are often mocking aggressors themselves. North American contemporaries like Beyoncé, Ciara, and Nelly Furtado may be occasionally prickly and even defiant, but they remain likeable; their Brit counterparts, meanwhile, openly court misanthropy. Estelle possesses some of this facility for table-turning spite; that much is clear from the teasing way she puts off a would-be seducer on ""Wait a Minute (Just a Touch)"", the opening track on her U.S. debut, Shine. Its successor, ""No Substitute Love"", which cleverly incorporates George Michael's ""Faith"", is also verbally steely, as is ""Magnificent"", which cautions, ""Don't tell me you love me just 'cause you're in the mood."" Such lines may paint Estelle as a bitter pill, but listen again. The likes of Allen and Winehouse thrill some with their unsparing bluntness and strike others as simply noxious, but that's not really Estelle's bag: she's far more humane. That Estelle isn't consumed with what she doesn't want and what you can't touch is evident by the third song, ""American Boy"", a crossover bid featuring Kanye West that predictably namechecks U.S. cities and landmarks but nonetheless features an irresistible hook and wonderfully buzzy synths courtesy of producer Will.I.Am. The remainder of the record is likewise stuffed with star beatmakers (Mark Ronson, Wyclef Jean, Swizz Beatz) and vocal guests (John Legend, Cee-Lo), meaning consistency is inevitably sacrificed to spectacle; however, when the overall effect is one of dynamism rather than incongruity, a little jumping around is forgivable. In particular, the warmth and open space of old soul better suits Estelle's unpretentious, matter-of-fact nature than Winehouse's contrived soak in sin, so the tough-but-pleading ""More Than Friends"" and outright revivalist ""Pretty Please (Love Me)"" (with its perfect full-throated cameo by Cee-Lo) are both clear album highlights. The sun-kissed reggae lilts of ""Magnificent"" (featuring Ronson's patented booming backbeats) and ""Come Over"" are also seamless fits, even as they bring out Estelle's unshakeable likeness to Lauryn Hill (surely the presence of Wyclef elsewhere on the record doesn't help). Shine's sheer sonic bigness and slightly schizophrenic musicality threatens to overwhelm Estelle's individuality as the record progresses, though she admirably muscles to the fore on the super-busy ""So Much Out the Way"" with ear-catching darts like ""Weezy make it rain but I'm holding the umbrella."" Unfortunately, when her candid toughness is needed most-- to bolster the generic modern soul of ""Back in Love"" and ""You Are""-- Estelle recedes into affectlessness (where her duet partner on the latter song, John Legend, permanently resides). Shine's lingering impression is that of several talented cooks crammed into a tiny kitchen, each crafting something delicious with little regard for the meal as a whole. And maybe we don't get a great feel for the overall vision of the woman who puts her name on the marquee. As a burgeoning performer, Estelle's outlook and approach has yet to solidify, but considering how unflattering a rigid artistic mien can often be, that's far from an indictment.",,6.8,
You May Already Be Dreaming,Neva Dinova,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b60f5e6ef9596932289f/1:1/w_160/1e07101b.jpg,2008-05-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11491-you-may-already-be-dreaming/,Saddle Creek,"I'd imagine that Old School finds its way into many a Netflix queue at this point in the year, as outgoing college seniors face the grim specter of adulthood. Maybe it's just serendipitous timing, but I can't help but see this film as a primary influence on You May Already Be Dreaming, even if Neva Dinova has been around since the 1990s and are on their third full-length LP. As Saddle Creek's diaspora continues to expand sonically as well as geographically, for their label debut, the Nebraska band (previously featured with Conor Oberst on the One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels EP) sounds seduced by the prospect of ""living the dream"" via arrested development, in this case, a time when the imprint/collective could be relied on for little more than Omaha natives playing a tears-in-your-Sparks combo of ""acceptable country"" structure and indie self-centeredness. The simplicity of the form makes it incredibly hard to fuck up, but You May Already Be Dreaming posits that it's also incredibly hard to make interesting. It's far from unlistenable-- the production is crisp and smooth, the songs uncomplicated and uncluttered-- and Jake Bellows has a pleasant, conversational sing-speak of a voice that rests somewhere near saltine roots-types like Andrew Bird and M. Ward. But the title unfortunately serves as its own epitaph: envision an alternate reality where the California sound of the 70s was more influenced by ether than cocaine. Even when they try to season their folky blandishments with fuzzbox soloing on ""Clouds"" and ""Someone's Trippin'"", it's still too lethargic to sound like something other than the death whinnies of Crazy Horse lurching to the glue factory. Perhaps even more so than Titus Andronicus, these guys beg for a reevaluation in regards to the influence early Saddle Creek recordings. While Conor Oberst and Tim Kasher rarely saw past their own shoes and tended to equate violently oscillating caterwaul with honesty, they managed to short-circuit conventional confessional songwriting by failing to acknowledge any walls, let alone the fourth. The problem here is that Bellows has far too much trouble saying what he actually means. ""It's hard to love a body from the ground"" goes the infinitely repeated mantra of the first track, and while it's not hard to follow, it also doesn't amount to a whole lot. ""Will the Ladies Send You Flowers"" tries for some sort of hardscrabble deathbed confessional, but you never get a sense of any real emotion other than comfortable numbness, and I'm fairly certain that wasn't the point; the vague laments about women and whiskey reek of someone who slept through most of their week at Drive-By Truckers Fantasy Camp. Specificity rarely turns out well either, as ""Supercomputer"" tries to install Wolf Parade's ""We Built Another World"" into a MacBook, but instead we get a liveblog of playing SimEarth. And if there's a time when lyrically using ""Google"" as a verb will be acceptable, it's far in the future. Even when they (maybe) skew misogynistic on ""She's A Ghost"", lines like ""Let the sun dry your towels instead of me"" are really too cryptic to offer even a base pleasure. But as much as the words drag down You May Already Be Dreaming, Neva Dinova's bigger problem is casting its lot with such a limited handful of sounds. If we're to take ""Apocalypse"" at face value, David Bazan will be narrating the End Of Days half asleep next to a humming amp. And you would think these guys would know better than to ladle a song called ""Tryptophan"" on this platter-- especially when it's acoustic and comes at the midpoint of an experience that often feels like freebasing raw, uncut tedium.","Bright Eyes associates' third full-length is their first on Saddle Creek, and their brand of earnest, countrified indie brings to mind an earlier time in the label's history.

Memory Drawings,The Drift,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b608c0084474cd0c250c/1:1/w_160/7a34c405.jpg,2008-05-23 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11486-memory-drawings/,Temporary Residence,"It's difficult to write a review on a record like Memory Drawings, the second studio full-length from the Drift-- not because the music is especially enigmatic, but because it stubbornly, almost grouchily, avoids exposition. On one hand, the Drift is pretty easy to categorize, residing on the post-rock-heavy label Temporary Residence and creating the same sort of obtuse instrumental compositions as label-mates Explosions in the Sky and Mono, and fellow San Franciscans Continental. But it's not quite so easy to locate their tenor, to get the band's own ""drift."" Just about everything about the Drift screams ""slippery slope"": The vague bebop influence-- jazz brass and double bass both crop up-- runs the risk of turning into Beat café beard stroking; the dub infused post-rock flavor can evoke jam bands; long stretches of little-changing guitar riffs and horn swells can become a chore. This all would seem to damn Memory Drawings as a cliché from the outset. But it's an intriguing contradiction that the band's somber vibe, similar to that of their Temporary Residence contemporaries, rubs up against their jazzy backgrounds to reveal a subtle inner game of impatience tugging at all edges of their compositions. The Drift have been eager to step out of their affinity for ambient rock ever since the group's first release, the Streets/Nozomi EP. The folky influence of New Weird America seeps through, frosting the light tremolo-affected guitar that leads into ""I Had a List and I Lost It"", and providing melodic counterpoint to the doleful brass of ""Smoke Falls"". Then the group can, on a whim, seamlessly transition from electric folk into the space-age resonance of dub on ""If Wishes Were Like Horses"". But given all the random noise and offhand feedback that could be heard on their debut full-length Noumena, Memory Drawings is a comparatively straightforward take. These compositions, scooting to a start from the first plaintive guitar riff or trumpet line, are exquisitely seen, never dilly-dallying over their eight-odd minutes. From the driving ""Uncanny Valley"" pour shades of funky soul along with detached guitar and twittering trumpet lines. ""Golden Sands"" could be mistaken for the Balearic kraut-dub of Sweden's Studio or London's A Mountain of One, especially considering the hypnotic and sometimes fiery battery commanded by drummer Rich Douthit. Memory Drawings may be the friendliest recording the Drift have released thus far, but it still escapes rational discussion beyond the summation of its influences. Part of the problem is that the group doesn't really profess mastery of any of those influences, preferring instead to shop around for an assortment of textures to suit their needs. Half the time, the band doesn't sound at all like a dub group, and their jazz influence only rears its head when Jeff Jacobs' brass or Safa Shokrai's bass decides to step up the tempo. But the Drift exercise great taste and patience in the contemplative histories they borrow from, and while they tarry in the classic post-rock world of repetitive, abstract grooves, they also keep one foot in some other fantastic land at all times, always one step ahead of our efforts to apprehend them.","The second full-length from this San Francisco post-rock quartet, who have toured with labelmates Explosions in the Sky and Mono, skirts dub, krautrock, and jazz while remaining difficult to pin down.

Crystal Stilts,Crystal Stilts,by: Mike McGonigal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f79d034d5c69bf50f9/1:1/w_160/38da0431.jpg,2008-05-23 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11469-crystal-stilts/,eMusicWoodsist,"The Crystal Stilts are moody-sounding fuckers who make fabulous stripped-down garage-pop. Their mix-and-match post-punk ditties manage to sound both affected and effective at the same time; they're weirdly life-affirming and very fun. You want to dance when you hear them-- dance with a furrowed brow, maybe, but move around nonetheless. Singer Brad Hargett is from Brooklyn by way of Florida but sounds like he's from Manchester by way of Slough. The main thing I wonder when I listen to Crystal Stilts is why is it so hard to make exceptional garage-pop like this? I mean, how hard can it be to plonk out a little la-la-loo-lee number on your $80 Sears guitar or your beat-up Casio and then record the thing in the bathroom in one take? It's been stated in ways both eloquent (David Fair's brilliant and oft-quoted manifesto ""How to Play Guitar"") and cheesy as heck (Bono's ""three chords and the truth"" which he lifted from Harland Howard re: Hank Williams), but should it not by definition be simple to do this? Of course it is not. Rock'n'roll is theft-- all the great ideas have been recycled a thousand one times already. So to hit upon a winning combination of old and new gets harder than coming up with a band name that doesn't return hundreds of hits when you plug it into the old Google. (I have to say that I wish another band had already called themselves Crystal Stilts already, as the name outright blows-- plus what's with the mini-plague of Crystal bands?) Self-limiting is the key to great garage-pop: By keeping it stripped-down on purpose-- whether you're the Saints ca. 1975 or Beat Happening ca. their whole career-- you unleash something greater than yourself. This is the Oulipian ideal, that one can free the subconscious by making oneself a drone to either the obvious or to seemingly haphazard rules. It's also partly why La Monte Young is punk as fuck-- but you know that already. Crystal Stilts do not sound like the Saints or Beat Happening or La Monte Young. These are weird pop songs you clap your hands along to. They pile a rockabilly riff and nursery school melodies onto a revved-up bass line and sweet surfy 60s organ riff on top of minimalist percussion on the song ""Crystal Stilts"". The amazing ""Crippled Croon"" takes the stand-up drum roll from ""Just Like Honey"" and grafts echoed-up vocals, a reverb-swallowed guitar, and a sub-atomic bass line onto it. And ""Shattered Shine"", with its psychedelic layers of tambourine, guitar, and organ, is a perfect marriage of Ian Curtis-y doom with sunshine-y Shop Assistants-style pop. The Stilts sing in fake Brit-sounding accents, but somehow the dude's droll, goth-y croon never grates; it helps that the band pushes his vocals way low in the mix. In what little press the band has gotten, they've been compared to New Zealand bands. I feel that a lot of this alleged New Zealand copping has been pasted onto the Stilts because it was Clean drummer/singer Hamish Kilgour who helped to ""discover"" and help the group out. It's worth pointing out that in the 80s themselves, many American acts were greatly influenced by NZ groups. It was the late 80s, of course (and on into the early 90s), but acts as beloved today as Pavement and Neutral Milk Hotel-- as well as currently obscure acts such as World of Pooh and Wingtip Sloat-- would have sounded a lot different if they hadn't been buying up every Flying Nun record they could get their hands on back in the day. Some folks complain that they cannot understand Brad Hargett's lyrics, but pop lyrics are typically a disappointment. Burying them is actually a winning strategy, and it's a safe bet that this is intentional-- that Crystal Stilts are aesthetes and are doing this because they also like records that sound this way. Either that, or the Stilts are broke as shit.","Weirdly life-affirming and very fun, Crystal Stilts are moody-sounding fuckers who make fabulous stripped-down, C86-like garage-pop.

DISCO,HEALTH,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b63e13d197565213adcf/1:1/w_160/fefa2728.jpg,2008-05-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11534-disco/,Lovepump United,"Funniest band name ever (this week only). It's so undangerous and sub-ironics that it seems to circle back around to being scary, snide, and nihilist. I crack up every time I'm getting to see them live and someone wheezes any variation on ""I cannot wait to get my fill of...HEALTH!"" (How did these guys resist-- especially since, like certain fellow Californians Zach Hill and Spencer Seim, they share a love for maniac percussion and Nintendosonics-- giving themselves the pseudo-metal moniker Hellth?) HEALTH's self-titled debut earned them sniggering sobriquets like ""Boredoms Jr"" and ""Diet Liars,"" yet among what kept the admittedly derivative album interesting was the tension produced by its attempts to artfully reconcile dance/digital elements with rock/noise textures (not to mention  its ambient fringes and the occasional blotch of straight-up pop). The resulting sound was skeletal, adrenal, and clangorous. Listeners inclined to attribute narrative structure to otherwise chaotically sequenced albums could even consider the debut as bearing a tale of one musical mode's victory over-- or surrender to-- another: The electro-clubbily titled and (eventually) executed ""Glitter Pills"" was followed by the lurching (dying?) rock of ""Perfect Skin"", and then the platter closed with the tribal, clipped-Gregorian funereality of ""Lost Time"". Which brings us to this remix album that feels like an argument: HEALTH's discography is here to mend those leftover rifty, provincial scenes where the guitar dorks and electro goobers still get aesthetically territorial at each others' keggers. Just a couple of weeks ago, I saw opener the Death Set put a crowd of (to safely generalize) dance-kids awaiting a Bonde Do Role and Villains card on edge by screaming ""Come on, you motherfuckers, this is a punk rock show!"" While, yup, the Death Set remix dance tracks and all, their own stuff is hooky hardcore, in some ways a better bridge from Death From Above 1979 into MSTRKRFT than that, ugh, DFA1979 remix album (plus all them groups are/were kinda dickish on stage). What I'm trying to say is that the overtly dancefloor DISCO/DISCO+ is a whole other thing from HEALTH's previous output, and yet, it works. HEALTH ran so lean that you wanted to offer it some smoked gouda and cherry pop, so one might expect a rework-roster of blog-friendly artisans to supply the cheese and, well, coke. But DISCO is that rare, not-disposable such collection, largely justifying the charming pomp of the band-- printing their project names in allcaps, the tendency to issue artistic statements, etc. Of DISCO, they decreed: ""It is not about market saturation or crossover appeal. It is purely about the music, and we are proud of it. This is an album, and meant to be listened to as one. The goal of this record is not only to present all these songs at once, but also to ensure that they are not forgotten in the constantly updating, content-hungry internet music world."" Okay, they've hitched their viral sincerity to their synergy-savvy; just as Crystal Castles gave HEALTH's profile an alley-oop (and like hip-hop and r&b's infamous, infinite ""featuring""s), they're boosting this release's electronic acts, to the point of listing them as members in a collective on DISCO's separate-from-regular-ol'-HEALTH MySpace page. And don't get my wallet started on the website for HEALTH FASHION, your mailorder source for American Apparel V-necks boasting pastel mandates. The bandmembers' names don't appear in this review because I am taking the group up on its insistence that it's not concerned with the pretense/spotlight of individual utterance-- in fact, I kind of wish they, sigh, took it further by wearing masks and adopting glyphic pseudonyms. This dance collage may often push the vocals to the front of the mix much more than its source material did, but those droned-in, genderless, ghost-tech vox are what make HEALTH seem both disembodied and like a superorganism in the first place. The concept/gimmick of identity is further shattered by the diversity of the remixers' approaches; DISCO is like an Oz or Wonkan chocolate factory of beat styles, all proving the point that drum machines can pummel just as cathartically, and as fetchingly, as forearms. Some of the remixers employ only one processed and reverbed ""clonk!"" from HEALTH, yet others use the original work's entire structure as an undergirding. DISCO's basic arc is: begin close to home, drift (albeit aggressively) through decades of electronic music, rest for a metronomic eight-minute piece by C.L.A.W.S. to wonder what the point of life is, and backtrack to a computer simulation of HEALTH's OCD assault for a finale. Amateurish DJs might score respect by playing the Acid Girls remixes, because their constant, exciting shifts will leave the impression that you're blending multiple tracks. Thrust Lab's epic ""Problem Is"" comes off as somehow funny and ominous, tonally coasting from Vangelis' Blade Runner score into Giorgio Moroder into some Weather Report fusion, landing on (duh) M83. CFCF's take on ""Triceratops"" picks up that dairy product and trumps it by adding Oldfield/Exorcist-y ""Tubular Bells"" jive, and some of that Steely Dan shit that Adult Swim's Tim and Eric mock/celebrate, all with a sick pulse reminiscent of so many 80s horror movie jams, including Hot Ice's ""Theme From Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3-D"". The bonus material on DISCO+ is less of-a-piece, but just as varied and deserving of widescale distribution. Nastique throws the classically stilted ""Blue Monday"" beat under HEALTH's prehistoric-squawk bus, Bearded Baby re-remixes Crystal Castles' (also included here) HEALTH remix, and Captain Ahab mashes the band up with Foot Village's wellness-centered ""Protective Nourishment"". Only DISCO+ is as playful as the cover art's promise of ""ALL THE HITS"" in an awesomely humorless font. So, forfeit the urge to hold a conviction-o-meter up to these rattle-come-latelies' homages to Swans, Ruins, and Lightning Bolt. DISCO streamlines HEALTH's analog-trance thickets without letting the beats betray the atmospherics. Never merely meager, this project delivers, both when you're waving your orgy-snorkel all blotto on-the-town, and for a soundtrack to serious rumination at your midday desk of harsh reality. None of the parties involved are inventing, or reinventing, anything, necessarily, but damn if they aren't tinkering their asses off.","HEALTH's debut album attempted to artfully reconcile dance/digital elements with rock/noise textures. The group goes one step further on this remix album, which features contributions from Crystal Castles, Acid Girls, Thrust Lab, and many more.

Inherit,Free Kitten,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b647ea9e61561daa6f45/1:1/w_160/ae68dbd0.jpg,2008-05-23 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11542-inherit/,Ecstatic Peace,"Whenever the alt-world supergroup Free Kitten (Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and Pussy Galore's Julie Cafritz, in conjunction with various pals, including Boredoms drummer Yoshimi P-We) took to the recording studio, anything and everything was fair game-- obnoxious atonal guitar screeds, off-kilter hook-laden pop, awkward rock-based hip-hop, shimmering Serge Gainsbourg covers. The one constant in Free Kitten's plan of attack was their maddening inconsistency, both in style and in quality-- single tracks might knock your socks off, but the breadth and length of their three albums (two full-lengths, one singles compilation) aren't for the faint of heart. While Inherit is Free Kitten's first album in over 10 years, that aspect of the group sadly hasn't changed. This time around (with the three lovely ladies getting J Mascis to join the fun on a few tunes), they trade their scattershot genre-hopping for a more concise two-pronged approach. The majority of the album-- eight track's worth-- is taken up by Gordon-fronted expansive blissed-out meanderings one tends to expect on proper Sonic Youth albums from Thurston Moore or Lee Ranaldo. Whether the group takes the scenic route (as on the 11-minute ""Monster Eye"") or plots a more direct course (via the ominous tribal throb of ""Billboard""), it's in no rush to reach its destination. Instead, it luxuriates in waves of feedback and mildly propulsive percussion-- even Mascis' squealing contributions to ""Surf's Up"" do little to up the energy level. This approach works just fine when Gordon's indomitable singing voice is treated as just another piece of the reverb-drenched scenery, as on album closer ""Sway"" or the shamanistic ""Free Kitten on the Mountain"". When she actually speaks her mind, however, things don't go so well-- her spoken-word guitar-hero tribute at the end of the otherwise enjoyable ""Monster Eye"" is chock-full of hollow portent and leaden poetics (""he starts doing surgery...then he starts strumming slowly"") , while the lame lit-centric jabs in ""The Poet"" (""The New York school/ It's made of dicks"") recall Dirty-era Gordon at her laziest. Those jonesing for a high-quality emulation of those halcyon days need look no further than the four Inherit tracks fronted by Cafritz. Her tunes are full of invigorating piss and vinegar, be they centered around sing-songy rhymes (like ""Seasick"") or hit-and-run punches powered by Yoshimi's best Steve Shelley imitation (like ""Roughshod"" or ""Help Me""). The dodgiest of her four efforts is ""Bananas"", an irony-powered pile of sludge (with Mascis on the skins) whose braindead rhetoric (""Monkey see/ Monkey do/ Hello monkey/ I see you"") is either brilliantly stupid or the sort of nonsense that makes one seriously reconsider intelligent design. Still, a full album of these rave-ups would be welcome. As would be a full album of Gordon making the skronky granola scene (with the hope that she either chooses her words more carefully, or opts to speak softly). Unfortunately, Inherit tries to give the listener both of these great tastes at once, resulting in a combination that's less like chocolate and peanut butter, and more like toothpaste and orange juice.","The first album in more than 10 years from Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and Pussy Galore's Julie Cafritz-- with help this time from Boredoms drummer Yoshimi P-We and J Mascis-- finds the duo's scattershot genre-hopping whittled down to a more concise two-pronged approach.

Paralyzed,Witch,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b61513d197565213ad94/1:1/w_160/919a7dc5.jpg,2008-05-22 05:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11496-paralyzed/,Tee Pee,"To paraphrase Brandon Stosuy's review of Witch's debut album, stoner/doom metal fans will likely find Witch-- which features Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis on drums-- fun, if hardly original. When these side endeavors become ongoing concerns, however, they lose some of their inherent charm-- especially if, like Witch, they're doing what lots of other groups have already done. And so Paralyzed might be harder and (in sound and in spirit) grungier, but it only goes to show that there's a world of difference between imitation and inspiration. As they did on their debut, Witch brazenly flog metal's standard sound and standard tropes: fast living, witchy women, bad trips, trippy myth-making, and whatever other bummed-out stereotypes they can pack and smoke. If the song's called ""Gone"" or ""Mutated"", you know what you're going to get. For the sake of convenience, they often stuff two or three of these themes into the same song-- the best is ""1000 MPH"", which envisions a crossroads where Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"" and White Zombie's ""Black Sunshine"" collide like lava lamp bubbles to form a zippy tune about a girl whose pedal is forever floored. That said, giving tracks ridiculously obvious names like ""Space God"" and ""Psychotic Rock"" begs the question of whether these guys are having fun or making fun. Regardless of intent, the sound of Paralyzed is an improvement on the group's eponymous offering. Producer Justin Pizzoferrato opts to move away from the clean, crisp backdrop Witch's John Agnello established. The lack of a ""Planet Caravan""-esque diversion (like ""Isadora"") might disappoint some-- the closest they come here to any sort of balladry is the thudding ""Sweet Sue""-- but the decision to just rock straight on through complements Pizzoferrato's choices. Every track sits beneath a murky haze and welcome coat of fuzz to the endless parade of pitch-perfect drum rolls and guitar solos. Pizzoferrato's approach also takes attention away from Kyle Thomas' voice, which is a definite plus. I don't mean to unjustly knock Thomas' singing-- it's fine for what it is, and it's not like many stoner standard bearers were blessed with golden-throated frontmen-- but placing his nasal moan front and center on Witch didn't do the group any favors. He has his less-than-flattering moments-- the rave-up outro to ""Psychotic Rock"" being Exhibit A-- but otherwise he's perfectly serviceable. But therein lies part of the album's problem-- the needs serviced by Witch have been serviced plenty of times before. Unless you're a J Mascis completist, or are in desperate need for a watered-down stoner fix, Paralyzed is a well-intentioned bummer that should be left well enough alone.","The second album from the stoner/doom metal band featuring Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis on drums is harder and (in sound and in spirit) grungier than its predecessor.

Ghost Games,Apes,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b638ea9e61561daa6f21/1:1/w_160/0a8c3af0.jpg,2008-05-22 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11528-ghost-games/,Gypsy Eyes,"That the Apes could switch out their frontman and still sound like the same band speaks to how their greatest strength is also their greatest limitation: the band's aesthetic is so rock solid and well-honed that their songs sometimes seem like simple reworkings of the same familiar elements. From its opening bass and distorted organ licks, there's no question that Ghost Games is an Apes record. But the band's substantial personnel shift (former singer Paul Weil being replaced by new guy Breck Brunson) has not only changed their voice, it's changed their entire vibe as well. Technically speaking, the difference between Weil's rhythmic bark and Brunson's high-pitched wail is fairly obvious. But there's a more ineffable difference between the two: Weil always seemed to relish in the goofiness of his lyrics, while Brunson seems to be more into keeping the fourth wall intact. Brunson's vocals are at once more earnest and more arrogant; it's the difference between flashing a grin at the audience and closing your eyes to say ""check this shit out."" Which isn't necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. The band hasn't quite adjusted its approach to its new singer. While Weil's unhinged persona added adrenaline to the steady and regular riffing of his bandmates, Brunson's melodic wailing leaves the band sounding less propulsive and intense. Indeed, while short melodic figures (I believe the kids are calling them ""riffs"" these days) are at the core of their music, Apes have always seemed like a band that is fundamentally driven by rhythm and energy. Sometimes Brunson's more broadly melodic approach doesn't interact all that well with the music underneath it; in ""Walk Thru Walls"", Brunson dutifully follows the band, but his vocals seem detached and disconnected. Still, Apes have more than their fair share of great songs under their belt with Weil fronting them, and Brunson's presence does seems to have reinvigorated them in places. In ""Info Ghost"", Brunson's croony swagger actually works well against the band's insistent bashing, creating a kind of rhythmic tension that has never really graced an Apes record. At times, Brunson's vocals bring to mind Jeff Buckley's more rockin' moments, but the songs themselves rarely serve to highlight his performances. There's no shortage of bands throwing around ghostly thematic material and dabbling in heavy riffs. But Apes are no dabblers, and Ghost shows a band moving even further away from stylistic equivocation. Apes are going to be a vaguely horror-themed riff-rock band whether you like it or not, and more power to 'em. It's hard to begrudge a band a transitional record when its in the midst of a substantial transition, and Apes wear it better than most. The second full-length from the Apes Mk I was far and away their best; here's hoping the band's new incarnation follows suit.","Despite switching frontmen Apes still sound like the same band, proof that their greatest strength-- well-honed, instantly familiar tracks-- is also their greatest limitation.

The Formula,Buckshot,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b616b1335d7bf169a9d7/1:1/w_160/bc011b0b.jpg,2008-05-22 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11497-the-formula/,Duckdown,"Like so many other May-December relationships, Buckshot & 9th Wonder spend plenty of time reminding us just how awesome their relationship is. The problem is that great duos in hip-hop never need to tell everyone just how intuitively combustible they are. When the upright Boot Camp Clik foreman hooked up with Little Brother's young-buck-producer 9th Wonder for their debut album, 2005's Chemistry, the logic was simple: youthful, nostalgic producer meets veteran, respected MC flickering into obscurity. 9th Wonder, then at the tail-end of his productive partnership with Little Brother and its loveless, snarky MCs (Phonte and Big Pooh, for the record) had bumped into Buckshot during a studio session. He confessed his boyhood fandom (9th was eighteen when Black Moon's 1993 debut dropped). Buckshot, grateful, applauded the young producer's commitment and acumen in crate-digging. The compulsory promises to try and find a project together are forgone. That very day the savvy rookie and the vet get into the booth, and voila, the lion's share of their feeling-out process became, as they reminded us, time and time again, Chemistry. The album was filled with sturdy, backward-looking prescriptions: Buckshot's effortlessly wry punch lines and 9th Wonder's trotting, sample-heavy beat scholarship. Their follow up, this year's The Formula, doesn't twist, invert, or spin their unwavering relationship. The album is an unforced renewal of vows-- vows with the same gaps and same peaks they had since they set out together. Even when a track on The Formula isn't an explicitly rote café love song-- and that's only about half the songs-- the psychology is meek hope, faint pride, reserve. Buckshot settles for his old preferences-- fists versus guns, 'dro versus yeyo-- and abstract praise for the struggle: ""Time fly by/ Guess how many people tryin' to make it in the world/ So am I/ I can't lie, I be on the side like 'Yeah/ Anything moving I'm there'"" (""Hold It Down""). Buckshot was never a rhetorical wizard like KRS or a stylist like Big L, but he sounds beyond cruise control, dangling sloppy enjambments and settling, the vast, vast majority of the time, for the easy, expendable simile or image (""Flip like pancakes""). 9th Wonder offers dutiful compositions, sticking to escalating woodwinds, and whiny, spring-loaded strings. Similar to his work on Little Brother's albums, 9th Wonder is a prodigy when it comes to vocal samples. The cooed hook on ""No Future"" glides like a flexed muscle in between the tin twinkles and tapped snares. ""Just Display"" has a smaller, more piecemeal vocal loop, but even there, 9th sneaks it into song's negative space, keeping the griddle-synths from overwhelming the sample. But even with 9th's craftsmanship, the melodies, like Buckshot's lyrics are vacuum-sealed. There's a pianissimo modesty that positively sucks the album dry. Even Buckshot sounds like he knows how bland they are: ""Steak and potatoes, all I need is gravy."" The urge to not overwhelm one's partner is a good one, but there has to be some sense of imbalance, of strain or push, to make a partnership more than an endless parade of door holding and back-patting. The Formula never dares to expose a dynamic between 9th Wonder and Buckshot. All we get is a happy partnership-- inert, consistent and imminently forgettable.","Second full-length collaboration between Boot Camp Clik rapper Buckshot and producer 9th Wonder tries to build on the success of their 2005 album Chemistry.

Street Sounds Electro: The Ultimate Boxed Set,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b61cb1335d7bf169a9e4/1:1/w_160/bd75cb2c.jpg,2008-05-22 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11504-street-sounds-electro-the-ultimate-boxed-set/,Street Sounds,"In one sense, you could call Morgan Khan an importer. That's basically what he did when he set up Street Sounds, the subsidiary to his dance label Streetwave, and released the first Street Sounds Electro compilation in 1983: here were eight tracks out of the United States that would've cost a couple of dozen quid for a UK buyer to import, all collected together for a price under five pounds. As a business decision, it was pretty shrewd, but as a scene-maker it was flat-out seismic: Thanks to the budget pricing and each volume's two sides of tight, continuous mixing from the likes of Herbie Laidley and the Mastermind sound system, the 22-volume Street Sounds Electro series-- later Street Sounds Hip Hop Electro and finally just Street Sounds Hip Hop-- was a major factor in defining what UK B-boys caught on to in the hip-hop world between 1983 and 1988. Street Sounds Electro: The Ultimate Boxed Set includes all 22 volumes of this influential series collected in mp3 form on two CD-Rs, preserving the DJ mixes as they initially appeared on the original vinyl. In many ways, it's a fortunate time capsule that hits on a lot of the now-iconic electro and rap classics of the mid-late 1980s and what sort of context they came from. Yet it also offers a deeper, messier variation on the evolution of hip-hop, one that covers most of the major bases between the old school and the sample era-- Grandmaster Flash, Run-D.M.C., the Roxanne wars, the dawn of golden age icons like BDP and Eric B. & Rakim and EPMD-- then complicates it all by throwing in a lot of strange stuff that history completely forgot, for reasons both unfair and justified. Just to give you a quick rundown of what was included in initial 11 volumes: Three cuts from West Coast electro master Egyptian Lover, including a 10:21 remix of 1985's all-kinds-of-nasty ""Girls"", five tracks from the B-Boys of ""Two, Three, Break"" fame, Cybotron's 1984 genre-name progenitor ""Techno City"", and the infamous Herbie Hancock ""Megamix"" put together by Grandmixer D.St. Then, of course, there are the anthems: Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel's ""White Lines"", Freestyle's ""Don't Stop the Rock"", Rockmaster Scott and the Dynamic Three's ""The Roof Is on Fire"", West Street Mob's ""Break Dance - Electric Boogie"", Mantronix's ""Needle to the Groove"", Hashim's ""Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)"", and Arthur Baker's ""Breakers Revenge"", just for starters. With the exception of the largely overlooked Afrika Bambaataa, whose only appearance in the entire series is a two-minute fragment of ""Bambaataa's Theme (Assault on Precinct 13)"" in Volume 13's clusterbomb of a mix, this is one of the more complete collections of electro and dance-provoking rap out there. While the significant presence of classic early-mid 80s rap integrated itself into the tenor of each Street Sounds edition-- or sometimes clashed against it, like the slow, wobbly dubbed-out strut-bounce of Rammellzee vs. K-Rob's ""Beat Bop"" did amongst the otherwise uptempo pop-and-lock fodder of 1983's Volume 2-- it started to gradually dominate the series as a whole, swapping out the vocoders-and-Kraftwerk vibe of classic electro for the harder, sparser sounds of hip hop's first hardcore phase. The second disc, covering Volumes 12-22, bears this out over time. The aforementioned Volume 13 megamix (originally released in 1986) reduces 21 tracks to a fragment of their original lengths-- typically between 90 seconds and three and a half minutes-- and streams them together in a largely seamless two-side blend of rap, r&b, and even synthpop: one stretch features the early (and ridiculous) Sir Mix-a-Lot single ""Square Dance Rap"", electro favorite Captain Rock's ""Return of Capt. Rock"", and a remix of the Information Society single ""Running"", before later going on to drop hip-hop classics like ""Pee-Wee's Dance"" and ""Eric B. Is President"". By 1987, the word ""Electro"" started disappearing from the compilation's now ""Hip Hop""-focused titles, the 808s slowed down drastically and sample-based cuts by the Ultramagnetic MCs (""Traveling at the Speed of Thought""; ""Funky"") and J.V.C. F.O.R.C.E. (""Strong Island""; ""Doing Damage"") started making their way into the mix. By '88, the last year of the Street Sounds Electro series, the closest it got to uptempo electro-rap was Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock's ""It Takes Two""-- by which time it was on its way to bypassing the whole ""electro"" thing entirely and getting identified as ""hip-house."" It's an illuminating history, an evolution of sound in a sort of beyond-canonical macrocosm. And by ""beyond-canonical macrocosm"", I mean there's a lot of extraneous crap. Some of it's fascinating, like Levi 167's ""Something Fresh to Swing To"", which shows up on 1988's Volume 20, builds up this monster drum machine rhythm and then sneaks in this occasional recurring sequence of Casio notes that sounds like the kind of melody the RZA would build a Bobby Digital track around 10 years later. And there's a good number of obscure mid-late 80s get-drunk-and-yell party anthems, like Bay Area crew A.T.C.'s ""This Beat is Def"" (featuring production from a young Paris) and the Almighty El-Cee's hard-hitting motormouth showcase ""We Have Risen"". But with a collection like this that was compiled as the scene actually happened and developed, there's no 20/20 hindsight to keep the mediocrities out, and there's plenty of them-- ranging from the Packman's grating Volume 1 opener ""I'm the Packman (Eat Everything I Can)"" to the Diaz Brothers' mostly-useless Dirty Harry-quoting ""It Takes Two"" megamix/knockoff ""Here We Go Again"" on Volume 22. In between there's Newcleus' godawful corny ""Huxtable House Party"" (which I'd like to think is what turned Bill Cosby against rap in the first place), CIA's bizarre Beastie Boys ripoff ""My Posse"" (written by Ice Cube and produced by Dr. Dre! In 1988!), Exhibit A against the idea of swing rap in The Jury's ""The Cotton Club"", the gooey, cloying saxophones all over Key-Matic's ""Breakin' in Space"", and a whole lot of stuff that sounds a bit like Arthur Baker only with fewer ideas. This is one of those collections where you take the bad with the good, and there's more than enough of both. Given how limited a pressing this collection is, your chances of being able to find this for yourself are fairly slim, and between the cost ($80+ American) and the headache of trying to find it anywhere, it might not necessarily be worth the effort, especially with many of the more desirable rarities included in mixed, cut, re-edited, and otherwise incomplete form. But when it works, it's definitely worth hearing. There's a third disc on this thing, by the way-- a DVD that includes a bunch of great music videos not just from electro and hip hop artists like Bambaataa and the Jonzun Crew and Man Parrish, but also fellow travelers Art of Noise, pop analogues New Order and progenitors Kraftwerk. It's a fine collection, and it might be the best part of the whole box, for one important reason: someone actually had the good sense to wait 25 years and see what was worth including after the fact.","Street Sounds Electro: The Ultimate Boxed Set includes all 22 volumes of Morgan Khan's influential 1983-88 series collected in mp3 form on two CD-Rs, preserving the DJ mixes as they initially appeared on the original vinyl.

Sool,Ellen Allien,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b634b1335d7bf169aa0c/1:1/w_160/9c09d2a2.jpg,2008-05-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11525-sool/,Bpitch Control,"Ellen Allien has long been branded a minimal techno artist without actually being one in any strict sense. Part of this branding is associative: Her flagship album was named Berlinette, and Allien has flirted aggressively with Berlin minimalism, imbuing all of her projects with dark, skeletal cores. On Thrills, this core was offset by trip-hop tropes; on Apparat collaboration Orchestra of Bubbles, by techno-pop opulence. But on Sool, Allien has caught up with her reputation. It is all core: uncompromising, barren, and austere. Orchestra of Bubbles was the rare Allien project with advertised collaborators. Often, she's had more discreet partners-- SmashTV on Berlinette, for instance-- and on Sool, Berlin's AGF helps out on production. Whether this darker turn for Allien owes to AGF's influence is anybody's guess, and quickly ceases to matter after you sink below Sool's deceptively shallow surface, into its inestimable depths. Listeners who've enjoyed the radiant humanity with which Allien has often graced her tracks might be daunted, as Sool is a defiantly post-human record. Voices, when they appear, are garbled crowd chatter (""Einsteigen""), the Field-style slivers (""Bim""), or alien languages that only Maja Ratkje could translate (""Elphine""). On ""Caress"" and ""Out"", Allien works over the titular words until they shed their meaning and become another moving part in a complex contraption. The sole exception is ""Frieda"", a melting electro-pop ballad with airy, intelligible vocals that offers a brief respite from the album's brutal opacity. At its smallest and most obscure, Sool suggests a world in which the last sentience has expired, but machines run on, humming and cooling in a depopulated landscape. Muted, rococo bass lines and echoing percussive flecks rub against each other with robotic persistence, and like the proverbial tree falling in an empty forest, we picture a drum machine percolating the air in an empty room. This is the first impression Sool conveys, but repeated listens reveal a humanity clandestinely working beneath its rhythmic clockwork. On the surface of ""Sprung"", we move by echolocation through its darkness before locating the elaborate, synthetic hand percussion. Most of Sool operates this way: The dominant mood is stern and deadening; the recessive one is playful and alive. Allien's beats may be matte-finish, but they contain loads of subtle grayscale contrast offset by embellishments of startling brilliancy. Textural snippets glance off of each other with sandpapery friction, or cascade over the compositions like fiber-optic shimmers. This is especially pronounced on the aptly-titled ""Caress"": Amid a heavenly drone and thumping percussive triplets, a ping-ponging sub-rhythm and muffled rolls seem to build a static charge, raising the hairs on the back of your neck. It's these deep contrasts between dull and bright elements, or near-sounding and distant-sounding ones, that lend the album its odd sense of space. For microbeat-based music, it feels surprisingly ample. On ""MM"", for example, the rhythm ticks concisely, like a marble bouncing on tile, while the bass fans out overhead, leaving a great chasm between them. Still, as minimalist manifestos go, Sool is strident, and some listeners might wish Allien hadn't done such a good job of it-- it asks for a lot, and metes out its rewards slowly. But I find it to be a profoundly articulate conceptual space, both rudimentary and complex, composed of more nothing than something. That ""nothing"" can be disorienting to wade through, and we're lucky to have Allien, one of techno's most confident producers, as our guide.","The Bpitch Control owner's latest record is uncompromising, barren, and austere-- and another success in a career full of them.

It's a familiar script: Brooklyn quartet Flying broke out in 2006 with their self-recorded debut Just-One-Second-Ago Broken Eggshell, which crackled with the sort of electricity that occurs when too many kids-- well, three, anyway-- enter a room with too many instruments. What follows is a new label-- Menlo Park-- a sophomore effort, Faces of the Night, recorded out of pocket at Illinois' Keyclub Recording Co., and presumably a larger touring profile. The hangup, of course, is Flying sound slower, denser, and less like a dynamic Brooklyn skewering of twee and more properly like wannabe residents of Athens, Geo., or Olympia, Wash. This isn't selling out, of course, but the refinements are disappointing. Vocals are introduced in entirely conventional manners; there seem to be ""vehicles"" for each of the band members-- Sara Magenheimer's adolescent coo and then the three more indistinguishable males: Eliot Krimsky, Eben Portnoy, and new member Mike Johnson-- rather than the tactical ""if you're near a mic, sing""-approach of the first album. Out-of-tune bits sound less like interludes gone haywire and more like songs sung out of tune. No longer do woodpeckers interrupt or claptrap drums rock, then roll. The arrangement scream ""A lot of thought went into this!""; creating art this way is noble but it ultimately distances Flying from their most productive impulses. Faces is not devoid of sparkly, inspired moments. ""Stains"" is built on a funk riff that stops only for Mt. Eerie-lite harmonies. ""One-Eyed Son"" opens the album with a cartoony boing-ing sound effect promptly mimicked by a festive acoustic guitar and a vocal melody that sounds like it's rocking in a chair with an uneven leg. On ""Draw It in the Dark"" Magenheimer does her best Moe Tucker impression over a pleasantly arepeggiating guitar: ""I'm Sticking to You"" airbrushed onto a Lisa Frank folder. Still, too many reminders of how weirdly linear Flying have become: ""Fear of Flying"" switches from a beatific drum machine pat to Sufjan Stevens' plaintive piano chording to a major key organ drone and finally to choppy guitar strumming, but each section's execution is Catholic. ""Firetruck""'s bassline sounds like corkscrewed big-tent music but it carries on for four minutes before an electric guitar and some reverberated ""ahh ahh""'s ride the song out for another two, producing the sort of watch-glancing length the Flying wisely avoid elsewhere. Other songs-- ""Poor Simone"", ""The Wrong Hearts"", ""Double-Hearted Clown""-- plod without event. Flying are well within their rights attempting this transformation, of course, but their move from avant-pop that fused Brooklyn's best out-music tendencies to four-track bedroom twee to careerist indie pop is an acutely stinging injustice. The most disappointing aspect of Faces of the Night-- especially in light of their debut-- is that it seems sustainable. Probably good for them, you know, in the long run.","After playing avant-pop that fused Brooklyn's best out-music tendencies and four-track bedroom twee, Flying now settle for careerist indie pop.

They could swoon like Tindersticks, chew scenery like Nick Cave, scrape and seethe like Black Heart Procession. But the question remained: Were they simply the sum of their parts? 2006's Coal was satisfying, but it was difficult to figure what the band brought to their sound that was truly specific to them. On their third album, Yes, U, all of the aforementioned touchstones remain in Devastations' RIYL line, but they've refashioned their influences at the structural level to create a sound that's both classic and singular. It breaks the band's previously narrow influential line, conjuring up affinities as far-flung as Castanets (an oneiric, dirge-like quality) and Luomo (the carefully arrayed and proportioned space). The music oozes like a lava lamp, and its intuitive progression allows for these kinds of evocative-not-literal associations, significantly broadening its scope. Yes, U forgoes overt verses and choruses in favor of long, unraveling vamps; tempest-in-a-teacup tensions that simmer and boil over; slow-burning bump'n'grinds. It favors restrained power over the raw variety, so the pressurized bass lines round off smoothly, tricked-out cymbal hisses protract crisply, harmonies hover, flanged guitar lines nearly vanish while riotous choked-throttle ones rev up, and sheets of synthesizer ripple. Nothing is left to chance yet these songs feel inspired and organic. ""Black Ice"" sinks a pointillist grid of hand percussion and bass into a suspension of guitar and keyboard tones, as comb-filtered synth filaments whiz through it like electrical currents. Nothing on Coal felt so alive, and as the first track on Yes, U, it's a winning introduction to the new Devastations. Lest we think ""Black Ice"" a novelty, ""Oh Me, Oh My"" follows it with nearly eight minutes of blissed-out kraut-gospel, with a motorik thud buried in sprays of lunar dissonance and curtains of icicle chimes. ""Rosa"" rides a dark wave of three-pronged bass stabs toward its cacophonous climax, and ""The Pest"" bends quicksilver guitar distortion around a hypnotically static pulse. The instrumentation threatens to steal the show yet the vocals-- once central to Devastations' music-- still remain significant. Bassist Conrad Standish and guitarist Tom Carlyon are the primary singers, and while Standish's ghoulish baritone is more striking, both men invest the music with an air of urbane dread that suits its introverted histrionics. They murmur hangdog appeals to absent divinities, write valentines in black blood, issue barbed proclamations that we're not meant to believe: ""I'm so interested in life,"" goes one deadpanned global kiss-off. Seldom do disinterest, world-weariness, and depression sound so interesting, worldly, and darkly euphoric.","Berlin-based, Australian expats move from atmospheric neo-goth to something that-- although it still feels in line with Tindersticks or Nick Cave-- sounds both classic and singular.

Soul Messages from Dimona,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6035e6ef9596932288a/1:1/w_160/6f1c2714.jpg,2008-05-21 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11481-soul-messages-from-dimona/,Numero Group,"You didn't learn anything in history class. Maybe that's harsh. You undoubtedly learned things, but the picture of history-- especially recent history-- you get in school is essentially a massive connect-the-dots mural with only a fraction of the dots connected and none of the colors filled in. You have to work to do the rest, and that's one of the reasons I love compilations like this. It helps you fill in a part of the picture that you never even thought to look at. It's a 16-track compilation of soul music, sure, but it's intertwined with the histories of Israel, Liberia, the Black Hebrew movement, Zionist emigration, and black art and culture in Chicago. The music on this disc was all recorded in Israel, made by a group of black expatriate Americans living in the Negev Desert city of Dimona. I can't give a full history of the Black Hebrew movement(s) here, but suffice to say that it tied together aspects of Judaism, black nationalism as first articulated by Marcus Garvey, and Zionism; South Chicago's Black Hebrew leader, Ben Ammi Carter, saw Garvey's back-to-Africa concept as a step on the way to settling in the Promised Land itself, Israel. The path from Chicago to Dimona was a winding one, and it ran partly through the recording studios of Chicago, where many of the musicians heard here first connected with each other in the Metrotones, an extraordinary studio band that played on dozens of hit 45s in the mid-60s. As certain musicians in the group became more involved in the movement, they also began plans to emigrate to Liberia, where they turned to music as a way to earn a living when economic prospects in their settlement turned from dim to downright grim. The move was made in 1967, and the Soul Messengers, as they were christened, were possibly the first group to play James Brown's ""Cold Sweat"" in Africa, while Geraldo Pino, Orlando Julius, and Fela Kuti were all still working highlife grooves. Touring West Africa proved too difficult and unrewarding to continue (In his Black Hebrew memoir From Night to Sunlight, Thomas ""Yehuda"" Whitfield described a harrowing incident in the Ivory Coast in which he and bandmate John Boyd were taken captive and nearly killed during one particularly awful trip), and the settlement in Liberia dispersed to Israel and the U.S. Boyd and Whitfield returned to America, but ultimately joined their brethren in Dimona in 1972. The Soul Messengers, restocked with members from within the community, boosted their popularity by playing military gigs free of charge during the Yom Kippur War. The Soul Messengers were augmented by satellite acts, the female vocal group Spirit of Israel, the teen duo the Tonistics, and ultimately a male vocal group called the Sons of the Kingdom. All are featured on this compilation. In one sense, this is something of a summary of Numero's explorations of the unlit corners of soul history. It has religious funk, rough-edged disco, singing children, eccentric soul, communal living arrangements, shoestring budgets, Black Hebrew tie-ins, psychedelic touches, altered identities, and lots of quality music that never got exposed as it might have. The variety is astounding, especially considering that it's the same basic group of musicians playing all the backing tracks. The Soul Messengers tracks range from a discofied semi-cover of Steam's ""Na Na Na (Kiss Him Goodbye)"" with Hebrew lyrics to funked-up jazz on ""Prince of Zeal"". ""Messiah"" is a brilliant, slow-burning psychedelic soul track with a ramshackle horn arrangement and an impassioned, subtle vocal, and ""Savior in the East"" is even more acid-damaged, with wah-wah guitars nipping at the edges of its Afrofunk beat and dubwise effects tripping out the vocal hooks. The most jaw-dropping groove on the disc, though, belongs to ""Victory"", a hard-hitting, high-tempo drum, bass, and horn workout; as an instrumental, it's not explicitly spreading the Black Hebrew gospel, but sometimes you don't need words to preach. Not surprisingly, this band provided stellar backing for its collaborators. The Spirit of Israel tracks are the most overtly gospel. ""Daniel"" has a great lead/response vocal arrangement, and the strangely lo-fi way the backing singers are recorded gives the otherwise hi-fi recording a weird, arresting quality. The young Tonistics sang beyond their years, and their tribute to Dimona, ""Dimona (Spiritual Capital of the World)"", is about as effervescent as kid soul songs come, with honeyed backing vocals from the Spirit of Israel. The Sons of the Kingdom's two tracks are a mixed bag. ""Hey There"" is a great slice of smoothly funky harmony soul, but their hysterical denunciation of modern life, ""Modernization"", is a rather ham-handed bit of alarmist social critique with an awkward groove and vocal arrangement. One interesting dud is a small price to pay for such an amazing clutch of forgotten gems, though. This is a solid, solid disc, and if you're allergic to religious music don't worry-- this music was specifically designed as a gateway to Black Hebrew thought and is often surprisingly secular or at least vague in its religiousness. Its value is enhanced, however, by the fact that it fills in a small bit of the story of the black American separatism and spirituality.","The latest excellent Numero Group release is a 16-track compilation of soul music, sure, but it's also music intertwined with the histories of Israel, Liberia, the Black Hebrew movement, Zionist emigration, and black art and culture in Chicago.

The Bake Sale EP,The Cool Kids,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b62cb1335d7bf169a9fe/1:1/w_160/804366bf.jpg,2008-05-21 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11518-the-bake-sale-ep/,Chocolate Ind.,"The first words you hear on the Cool Kids' The Bake Sale EP-- out now on iTunes and in stores early next month-- are as follows: ""tick tick clap, tick tickticktick clap."" The beat for ""What Up Man"" is classic minimal 808-heavy mid-1980s shit, the sort of thing Rick Rubin might've spent 10 minutes slapping together for an LL Cool J B-side, except that in place of actual hi-hat ticks and handclaps, we get the words tick and clap (and bass). That pretty much perfectly encapsulates the Chicago duo's approach right there: They semi-faithfully recreate the music of rap's low-budget bubbling-under era, but they do it with eyebrows arched and quotation-marks firmly in place. On ""88"", they make their aims explicit: ""Do the smurf, do the wop, baseball bat/ Rooftop like we bringing 88 back,"" itself a quote from an unashamedly retro 2002 Nas single. Mikey Rocks, the younger of the two Cool Kids, was born in 1988. But Cool Kids' 1988 revivalism doesn't rankle the same way that, say, Jurassic 5's 1981 revivalism can, largely because Mikey and partner Chuck Inglish never slap you over the head with the inherent superiority of the era they're reviving. Or: The Cool Kids don't rap about how hard they are, and they don't rap about how they don't rap about how hard they are. Instead, they mostly rap about how fly they are, which is fertile territory. Hearing the Cool Kids rap about their haircuts is sort of like hearing a circa-now rockabilly band singing about their pompadours. And that's fun. Songs about haircuts are fun. That retro-clothes fixation has gotten the Cool Kids widely tagged as ""hipster rap,"" an understood pejorative of deep meaninglessness. That term ignores the musical intelligence at work on The Bake Sale. The EP's beats, all self-produced, are all empty space, melody implied by the barest hints of synth-bass, every drum-machine woodblock-tunk impeccably timed. That gives the two rappers plenty of room to play. Mikey and Chuck both have the easy charisma and calm nonchalance to sell even their clunkiest punchlines. Their boasts tend toward the cartoonish, which suits them just fine: ""I could build a sandcastle without bringing a pail/ And go catfish fishing and come up with a whale."" And they're unshowy enough with their twisty internal rhymes that you might not at first notice the intricacies of a line like this one: ""Fly propellers propel us to the angels/ Repelling the fellas that's jealous of the name."" Of course, given that the Cool Kids don't concern themselves with much beyond the clothes they're wearing, there's precious little urgency to be found on the EP. The two never sound more committed than when they're playing up their own trendsetting abilities, and even that comes with a self-aware wink: ""I'm 'bout to say 'screw it'/ And grow a jheri curl, wear a diaper like Cupid/ Or something else stupid/ And see if people do it."" And they only break out of their spacey thud-rap pastiche style a couple of times: with the Miami bass pastiche of ""Bassment Party"" and the tumbling-break Marley Marl pastiche of ""What It Is"". Those self-imposed limits might wear a bit thin over the course of a full-length album, but the 10-track, half-hour running time of The Bake Sale is about perfect. Give or take the occasional 12"", The Bake Sale is the first commercially available product from a group that's built its rep via MySpace and live shows, and most of these tracks have been floating around the internet for a long minute. But it makes for a great little introduction to two guys who know exactly what they're doing and who do it well.","Chicago's the Cool Kids finally release their long-awaited, self-produced Chocolate Industries EP, out now on iTunes and in stores early next month.

The Virginia EP,The National,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b63dea9e61561daa6f2d/1:1/w_160/725ec956.jpg,2008-05-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11533-the-virginia-ep/,Beggars Banquet,"The National's Boxer deservedly landed the group on year-end lists and magazine covers, helping the band spend the past several months selling out progressively bigger venues and gaining increasingly positive word-of-mouth support. But beyond all the plaudits and praise, you can most easily tell the National have made it to the top because there are so many people complaining they don't belong there. Alas, these days backlash is the true mark of the winner. Still, not every victory deserves a victory lap. A slot touring with R.E.M. and Modest Mouse was healthy reward enough; in comparison, The Virginia EP, and in particular its companion film A Skin, A Night, feel unnecessary. One problem is that little on The Virginia is actually new or even unreleased. Rather, the EP works as a sort of souvenir, a reminder of the band's many highs over the course of the past several months, even if little on the disc actually comes close to matching those highs. Certainly it's less dull and disorienting than Vincent Moon's erstwhile doc A Skin, A Night, which comes off a belated electronic press kit. Were the band (or more likely its label) aware of the impact Boxer would later make, A Skin, A Night is the kind of thing that would have been sent out to drum up interest in a potential breakthrough act. Coming now, it's more than a little redundant and often boring. We know how the story ends, and the rudimentary sketches of Boxer's beginning don't exactly broaden its scope. The three songs that kick off The Virginia EP would have made a pretty fine single themselves, with ""You've Done It Again, Virginia"", the stately (and Sufjan Stevens-adorned) selling point, bolstered by the tougher ""Santa Clara"" and the brooding ""Blank Slate"". ""Mansion on the Hill"" is an odd cover choice to draw from Bruce Springsteen's tailor-made-for-the-National Nebraska; at least the group does a nice job rearranging the song to suit its strengths. Of the demos included, ""Tall Saint"" seems closest to fruition. ""Forever After Days"" and ""Rest of Years"" less so, though comparing the demo of ""Slow Show"" to what ended up on Boxer, one suspects both those works in progress could have eventually made the cut. What's left are an unremarkable Charlotte Martin cover, ""Without Permission"", and a handful of live tracks and radio sessions: ""Lucky You"" is a welcome reminder to newcomers that there was a National even before Alligator, while versions of ""Fake Empire"" and ""About Today"" adequately capture the mix of poignancy and pathos that make the National so thrilling live. But that's just what's missing here: the thrills. In fact, there's something even anti-climatic about The Virginia EP. Coming from a band powerful enough to change lives on the stereo or make you feel more alive while on stage, it seems oddly perfunctory. Not slapped together per se, but lacking the cohesive strength of Boxer proper. That's to be expected. That's what B-sides are typically for, after all-- material that for one reason or another is not quite A-level-- and indeed much of The Virginia previously made its way to various singles and other outlets. Yet taken together, these demos and live tracks don't add up to much more than a reminder that the finished product was much better than the sketches, and that the live tracks are no substitute for catching the band in person.","The National take a victory lap with an unnecessary collection of demos, B-sides, live tracks, and covers, none of which fully capture the group's strengths and appeal.

Autumn Fallin',Jaymay,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5fcc0084474cd0c24f8/1:1/w_160/512a5255.jpg,2008-05-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11475-autumn-fallin/,Blue Note,"Like Madonna, Björk, and Beyoncé, Jaymay (aka Jamie Seerman) rocks just the one iconic name. And like logorrheic, New York-based folk-popsters Regina Spektor, Nellie McKay, and Casey Dienel, she sings winsome, quasi-confessional songs that the linguistically lazy probably tag ""quirky"", but that never get within spitting distance of ""weird,"" let alone ""challenging."" You know, Sirius Coffee House playlist fodder and the gauze that NPR packs between All Things Considered segments. Jaymay even has an iPod-ad ready track in ""You Are the Only One I Love"", a sweet ramshackled sparkler of a song replete with singalong chorus and children's choir, lacking only the choreography. Do I really need to mention that Jaymay worked New York's open-mic circuit, developing an ""underground"" following, before a major label (EMI-owned Blue Note) came calling? Right, then. Key marketing messages, RIYL shortcuts, and inevitable female singer-songwriter baggage unpacked and put away, let's talk about Autumn Fallin' on its own terms. As far as debut LPs go (Jaymay previously self-released an EP) it's not bad. It also isn't likely to sway anyone not already leaning in its subway-busking direction, either. A couple of relatively unadorned girl-with-guitar numbers, ""Big Ben"" and the title track, barely venture out of the beige range of their musical and emotional spectrums. And ""Sea Green See Blue"" and ""Ill Willed Person"" are the kind of pleasant, generic tunes you enjoy well enough as they play but forget as soon as the last note wafts out of the speaker. None of these, however, are as unfortunate as the cabaret-lite ""Hard to Say"", which finds Jaymay scatting trumpet sounds-- something no one whose name isn't Ella Fitzgerald should even think about trying. That said, ""You'd Rather Run"", a hyper-verbose, 10-minute verse-piled-on-verse breakup song, with its waltzing Wurlitzer and descending keyboard crawls, is marvelous-- superbly arranged, psychologically nuanced, and wonderfully witty. Jaymay pays respectable homage to hero Bob Dylan (and god knows, greater musicians than she have failed there) with harmonica sputters and lacerating lyrics that bleed an ex dry with papercuts (""It's not that I hate you/ I never loved you enough to hate you,/ You moved to Montreal to be closer to France/ How's that working out?""). But with its emotionally ambivalent air of jaded rue, ""Run"" calls Leonard Cohen godfather as well. Other album apogees include ""Blue Skies"", a diamond-chiseled orchestral pop gem of deceptively sunny sangfroid, and the breezy xylophone and shaker-salted album opener ""Gray or Blue"". But as good as these tracks are, ultimately, they don't recompense for Autumn Fallin's bland stretches. And unfortunately, Jaymay has yet to, uh, effectively communicate her competitive advantage in what has become an overcrowded market.","Like logorrheic, New York-based folk-popsters Regina Spektor, Nellie McKay, and Casey Dienel, Jaymay sings winsome, quasi-confessional songs that the linguistically lazy probably tag ""quirky.""

Ames Room,Silje Nes,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5fdea9e61561daa6ec1/1:1/w_160/0a6b9ee2.jpg,2008-05-20 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11476-ames-room/,Fat Cat,"The first sound you hear on Silje Nes' debut album, Ames Room, is an ascending cascade of gulps, like water pouring out of a jug. In proper pitch, they could be a factory setting on a keyboard, but Nes (first name pronounced seel-YAH) modifies them slightly to sound more percussive and completely otherworldly. Those gulps appear throughout Ames Room, one of several repeating sounds-- like her shimmery guitar tone and soft vocals, reminiscent of múm's Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir-- that could be one instrument in a more traditional band lineup. But Nes recorded the album by herself in her Bergen apartment (well, almost by herself: Ungdomskulen's Kristian Stockhaus appears on one song), using an array of instruments and equipment, some of which she either found or constructed herself. Creating the album was a solitary pursuit, but unlike many bedroom auteurs who try to make one musician sound like many, Nes crafts music that actually reflects that isolation: Ames Room sounds like it's emanating from deep within her imagination. Even so, her aesthetic isn't stripped down or lo-fi. Her complexly layered compositions are dense with loops, synths, cello, drums, guitar, and a cacophony of unidentifiable sounds. ""Magnetic Moments of Spinning Objects"" builds a music-box lullaby against the high, abrasive whir of a rewinding tape. The two elements don't match up, but that may be the point: As muted as Ames Room often is, Nes seems less interested in making pretty sounds than in setting up experiments in conceptual dissonance. Most of the instrumental tracks are shapelessly ambient. ""Shapes, Electric"" establishes a lulled rhythm from the molten sounds of flute, wordless vocals, acoustic guitars, and what sound like sheep, all coalescing into a percussive time-keeping device that usually sounds like it's perpetually winding down. Similarly, ""No Bird Can"" closes the album with the sound of Nes blowing simple notes on bottles (presumably), backed by a typewriter clacking away in the next room. Other tracks on Ames Room are more structured, featuring Nes' ghostly vocals half-submerged in the music and her similarly piecemeal approach to lyrics. ""Drown"" consists mainly of one line-- ""We'll bring the water to the sea once more""-- repeated against spectral guitars, as if she made a tape of turning the phrase over in her head. She crafts an elegant, catchy melody on ""Ames Room"", the most direct and fully realized song on the album, and ""Giant Disguise"" grafts her vocals to a snappy guitar line that sounds like a pop riff on cough syrup. With its bouncing momentum and crisp guitars, ""Dizzy Street"" could be a Clientele song, at least until she starts singing in her strange whisper. Ames Room may be an essay on the possibilities of home recording, but these songs, simultaneously succinct and discursive, portray her more as a pop musician than as a sound tinkerer.","Bergen bedroom auteur used an array of instruments and equipment, some of which she either found or constructed herself, to craft her anticipated Fat Cat debut.

Terrible Two,Thank You,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5de9d034d5c69bf50ca/1:1/w_160/f52546e2.jpg,2008-05-20 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11445-terrible-two/,Thrill Jockey,"Thank You are plenty eccentric. The Baltimore based trio's sophomore record is loaded with grunts, howls, and guttural utterances rather than formal verse. Melodic contributions generally range from the pulse of a single repeated organ note to the thin and atonal skittering of a guitar. But all of these noisy hijinks are hung on a solid skeleton of killer rhythm. Drummer Elke KW is not a precision player. There are a few moments on Terrible Two where she seems poised to wander beyond the beat and off into stumbling entropy. But there's definitely a bit of prog-rock's ""more is more"" philosophy to her rhythms. If you wrote out a drum score for album opener ""Empty Legs"" it would probably just be a grid of thick black bars. KW crams a note into every available opening, leaving only enough space for bandmates Michael Bouyoucas and Jeffrey McGrath to pedal bass notes on an organ and blow a few whistles. Rather than being crowded and indulgent, however, the result is invigorating-- a tidal wave of tribal throb and primitive yowl that bursts with energy for its entire six-minute duration. If Thank You have a working method, it's montage. ""Self With Yourself"" begins with undulating snare and hi-hat syncopations, then breaks into cascading tom rolls, only to close with the halted splash of cymbal catches. Once a rhythm has been explored to the band's satisfaction they just ditch it and move on to the next and never look back. Thank You aren't making dance music-- at least in any traditional way-- but in a structural sense, they borrow from it. Terrible Two's compositions seem like they've been DJed into existence from a collection of the band's favorite This Heat and OOIOO breaks. Between the cluttered rhythms, the speechless chanting, and unrelenting spasms of guitar noise, Terrible Two packs a lot of diffuse information. Credit has to be given to J. Robbins (who engineered) and Chris Coady (who mixed) for filtering all of the buzz into a coherent picture. Each drum hit is given its own sonic space and it's own roomy reverb-- not one detail gets lost in the din. And there's a lot of din here. On the title track and final song, Thank You's manic energy starts to wind down. A curtain of cymbal washes gradually evolves into a subdued and cyclical rhythm, mildly affected with dubbed-out filters. Samples and organ drones stream lazily in and out. There's a sense that Thank You are gradually leading you by the hand toward some wild spiritual epiphany. However, that epiphany might be just as simple as this: More art-punks should develop drum chops.","On their first album for Thrill Jockey, these Baltimore art-punks with drum chops offer cluttered rhythms, speechless chanting, and unrelenting spasms of guitar noise.

Arm's Way,Islands,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c2ea9e61561daa6e67/1:1/w_160/449e3cdd.jpg,2008-05-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11420-arms-way/,Anti-,"This should be a victory lap for Islands. After all, their uniformly excellent debut resuscitated Paul Simon's Graceland as an indie pop touchstone back when Vampire Weekend were still playing in the quad. And with that album's bouncy calypso rhythms and hip-hop bursts, Jaime Thompson and Nick Thorburn (previously known by their noms de rock J'aime Tambeur and Nick Diamonds), succeeded in laying to rest the ghost of their beloved former group, the Unicorns. Since then, they have honed their breezy, buoyant sound on the road, and, despite Thompson's departure from the lineup, the Montreal-based sextet seemed on the verge of a major breakthrough, as demonstrated by moving from tiny indie label Equator to Anti-, home of such classy ""career"" acts as Nick Cave and Billy Bragg. But Arm's Way, which does away with the musical levity and genre experimentations of Return to the Sea, is much darker and more conventional than its predecessor, and not, unfortunately, to its benefit. Islands' new obsession with darkness does, however, make sense. The throughline between all of Thorburn's records (with Islands and the Unicorns) is a lyrical obsession with death in all of its forms-- from the corporal (bones) to the metaphysical (ghosts)-- so it was only a matter of time until his band tried to match its outward sound to the inner themes. Gone are the guest rappers, the acoustic nuevo-country twang, and the sunny Afro-Caribbean flourishes (though there are still a few brief flashes of them, as on chugging rocker ""J'aime Vous Voire Quitter"", which, two minutes in, implodes into a Bahamian ""La Bamba"" breakdown). In their place are theatrical string arrangements, layers of silvery, minor-key guitars, and lots of gothy synthesizers. To be fair, almost any record would suffer by comparison to their breathless first one. These songs may be less immediately catchy, but all of them have a moment in which they break away from their straightforward guitar-rock underpinning and allow strange, spacious moments to burble up from within. On ""Creeper"", the most memorable sing-along here, it's when the stomping 80s guitar melody briefly gives way to off-kilter bursts of steel drum. On ""Abominable Snow"", a song which predates Return to the Sea, it's a winsome vocal interlude that's nestled before the final crashing chorus-- a breathy call-and-response waltz that's laid against elegant violin embellishments and delicate guitar pulses. And on the record's best song, ""In the Rushes"", it comes after five minutes of tightly coiled build-up driven by sawing strings and Thorburn's choked, whispery warble, when the song explodes into major-key harmonies, galloping guitars, and sweetly twinkling glockenspiels. Thorburn is an imaginative songwriter and his voice (both literally and figuratively) has always been unusual. Though he often overstuffs his compositions, sometimes that excess works to his advantage. Rambling opener ""The Arm"", which navigates terrain that's both spare and baroque, is better off for its sprawl. Its melody matures as it encompasses soaring strings, moments of prickly pizzicato and a welcome section of last-album levity that marries golden harmonies to bright polyrhythms. Islands are at their best when they are weird. And there is plenty of weirdness on Arm's Way-- like 11-minute, three-movement album closer, ""Vertigo (If It's a Crime)"", and its trial-to-gallows plotline-- but it's bracketed by much more rock pomp than was expected or (probably) necessary. Bravo to the band for sidestepping the trap of trying to replicate a winning debut; if only the resulting sophomore effort didn't so blatantly feel like a losing effort. ","The latest from Islands, which does away with the musical levity and genre experimentations of the excellent Return to the Sea, is also much darker and more conventional than its predecessor.

Superfuzz Bigmuff Deluxe Edition / The Lucky Ones,Mudhoney,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b62e9d034d5c69bf515c/1:1/w_160/403882b3.jpg,2008-05-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11680-superfuzz-bigmuff-deluxe-editionthe-lucky-ones/,Sub Pop,"A strange thing happened on grunge's way to the mainstream: the best band got left behind. Maybe that's not so strange, since the best in any scene is rarely the biggest. What's odd is, before grunge's breakthrough, Mudhoney were pretty huge. Their brain-shaking 1988 single ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" was a definite indie rock hit-- at that year's CMJ Conference, so many people asked me if I had heard it that I nearly got a complex. A follow-up six-song EP, Superfuzz Bigmuff, was almost as popular, and certainly as good. At the time, it seemed a foregone conclusion that Mudhoney would make grunge big. Why Nirvana did so instead is no mystery, but the indelible mark left on indie rock by Mudhoney's first few records shouldn't be obscured. While the impact was partially due to buzz and circumstance, it came mostly because the music killed. Rising from the ashes of sludge-masters Green River, Mudhoney blurted a Technicolor yawn of 60s garage, Stooges-style howl, Jimi Hendrix fuzz, post-Black Flag steam, and proto-slacker slop. And they wrapped it in a blissfully primal package-- as animalistic as Iggy, with even less pretense. In 1988, Mudhoney were cool, especially because it didn't sound like they wanted to be. ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" and Superfuzz Bigmuff are still powerful two decades later: Steve Turner's guitar bleeding over ""Twenty Four"", Mark Arm's screams pumping the veins of ""No One Has"", Dan Peters filling every open drum space in ""Burn It Clean""-- none of it has been diminished by time. That's evidenced by Sub Pop's deluxe 2xCD set, which adds singles, compilation tracks, and demos, plus two fine live sets from winter 1988. Three versions of ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" all slay, but it was with follow-up single ""You Got It (Keep It Outta My Face)"" that Mudhoney peaked. The tune's lopsided sway is both urgent and half-awake, like a muttering drunk who blows your mind with off-handed profundity. An all-together-now ""Fuck you!"" at the end is Mudhoney in a nutshell-- they're laughing cause they really mean it, and vice versa. While the smoke from these records was still clearing, Mudhoney released a pair of excellent, underappreciated full-lengths, 1989's Mudhoney and 1991's Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge. Both offered gems approaching the best of Superfuzz Bigmuff. But they also exuded a modest, workman-like feel, indicating the band was headed towards a solid career unlikely to diverge from its quickly-beaten path. Five more albums over the next 14 years kept the flag flying, suffering only from a lack of surprise. Mudhoney got perhaps too good at being Mudhoney, able to churn out solid songs so effortlessly they've rarely felt the need to stretch their boundaries. No envelopes are pushed on the quartet's latest, The Lucky Ones. But there's an increase in firepower that makes it their best effort in a while. That's especially true of the first three songs, a head-spinning block that nearly matches the snap of Mudhoney's prime. The chugging ""I'm Now"" tears the air, while ""Inside Out Over You"" marries Billy Childish stomp to Dinosaur Jr. slouch, and ""The Lucky Ones"" rides Turner's high-rev fuzz. Lyrically, Arm seems acutely aware of time. ""The past made no sense/ The future looks tense"" he snarls in ""I'm Now"", and later he envies those spared time's march: ""The lucky ones have already gone down/ The lucky ones are lucky they're not around."" The album sags a bit in the middle, offering competent but not particularly memorable tunes. But Mudhoney rips through the last few tracks as convincingly as they did the opening three. On closer ""New Meaning"", over another searing Turner guitar line, a happily-hoarse Arm defends the band's continued relevance: ""I've got new meaning, baby/ Don't you take it away."" That new meaning may be same as the old meaning, but the fact that this hard-working band still means something is impressive-- and, based on The Lucky Ones, difficult to deny.","Sub Pop celebrates the seminal early Mudhoney recordings with a 2xCD set that features singles, compilation tracks, and demos, plus two fine live sets from winter 1988. Meanwhile, no envelopes are pushed on the quartet's latest, The Lucky Ones, but there's an increase in firepower that makes it their best effort in a while.

Strange Hexes,Imaad Wasif,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b60413d197565213ad71/1:1/w_160/6a3e90bf.jpg,2008-05-19 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11482-strange-hexes/,self-released,"The Los Angeles-based singer and guitarist Imaad Wasif has knocked around in a number of bands, including Lowercase, Alaska!, and the New Folk Implosion. He released an introverted solo album in 2006, but for the most part, he's seemed like the perennial utility player looking for a way to present himself as a frontman. After a profile-boosting stint as Yeah Yeah Yeahs' touring guitarist for Show Your Bones, Wasif is taking another stab at putting his name on an album's cover instead of inside its credits. With bassist/keyboardist Bobb Bruno and drummer Adam Garcia, he's crafted a hybrid of glutinous stoner rock, darkly-hazed psychedelia, and slogging proto-metal, like Crazy Horse by way of Black Sabbath. It's difficult to reconcile Wasif the songwriter with Wasif the Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist, as his playing style on Strange Hexes is deliberate and obtuse-angled, a sharp contrast to YYY's acute rave-ups. This implies that Wasif is a versatile guitarist, and certainly a talented one. Unfortunately, that versatility doesn't show through on this profoundly homogeneous album, and Wasif's talent is unduly circumscribed. Wasif and Two Part Beast know how to push a languid rock tune toward a chugging, barn-burning crescendo (""Wanderlust""), and they can seamlessly blend fuzzed-out arpeggios into tar-footed chords into gossamer webs of riffage (""Unveiling"" and ""The Oracle""). And they do, over and over. What they apparently can't or don't care to do is diversify, and despite its technical facility, Strange Hexes quickly becomes an exercise in tedium. Wasif is a game singer, with a tuneful and somehow vague voice, but he doesn't marshal much force, preferring to drift inconspicuously amid the carefully interlaced guitar phrases. The lyrics mostly stay out of the way, although occasionally, an eyebrow-raisingly ponderous phrase slips through (such as ""I am a chrysalis/ I am apocalypse,"" on the inevitable crunchy climax of ""Seventh Sign""). But for the most part, there's nothing dislikable about this album; it just seems uninspired: rock by rote. Its admirable qualities, such as Garcia's consistently muscular and fine percussion, don't cohere into songs that distinguish themselves from the relentless midtempo grind. Maybe a three or four part beast would've given it the extra heft it needs. As it stands, its slow-burns tend more toward wet-fuses, which will still spark if you wait around long enough. If you're willing to do so, you've far more patience (or weed) than I.","Former member of Lowercase, Alaska!, and the New Folk Implosion-- and touring guitarist for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs-- again tries his hand as a frontman.

Cheveu,Cheveu,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5dfea9e61561daa6e88/1:1/w_160/e5743ec6.jpeg,2008-05-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11446-cheveu/,Born Bad,"Though the instrumentation is simple and there's a little lo-fi gauze around their first full-length (just now getting CD release on Born Bad Records), don't mistake Cheveu for a one-trick pony. The French band's debut veers between delectably trashy drum-machine punk to Casio experiments that reverberate in slow, strange ways, hinting at graphic drug use and casual violence. The singer's voice is just slightly detached from the rest of the music, hovering somewhere above the band and adding to the album's woozy, unusual feel, whether barking, berating, or pleading. The songs are claustrophobic and desperate, or they're silly and indulgent. But they're nearly always concise, catchy, weird, and aloof. ""Jacob's Fight"" starts with a hint of faraway noise, before a speeding, descending guitar crashes in over a 4/4 drum machine beat that sounds like frozen meat being punched, while organs bleat out one wavering note underneath it all. Even if it's just two notes, the organ takes more focus on ""Clara Venus"" with an ominous fly-swatter hum that evokes B-movie villainy, but the guitar thrash gets slowly more sophisticated as the vocals get more gruff and animated. It has more swirling incidental noise and effects that occasionally recalls the hazy, unpredictable punk of early Butthole Surfers, though Cheveu's relative hold on traditional structures and sanity makes them sound more accessible. ""Happiness"" has the singer faithfully reading a grisly monologue from the Todd Solondz film, and while you may not play it the whole way through more than once, it reinforces the unpredictability and wry, indulgent humor of the record. ""Dog"" shows off a different mode of the band, one that sounds like a bizarre Lou Reed piss-take, from its more traditional blues-inspired riffs and monotone eighth-note piano bashing to its hilariously confused come-hither lyrics-- you could say something's lost in translation, but it's pretty clear they're aiming for absurdity here. (""You smell like shit, I'll take you to my mom's""). The record gets a little more frazzled and hedonistic as it goes on. ""Herman Choune"" begins with near-psychedelic organ tones, then retreats to the band at its most lo-fi, with a caustic and oppressive dry sound that's nearly oppressive, and makes its icy vintage keyboard tones sound as gritty and primitive as any guitar. ""Great Competitor"" drowns the vocals in echo to add chaos to its bluesier pogo-friendly stomp, the two-note tightrope riff of ""Superhero"" plays like a more unhinged version Pixies' ""Tony's Theme"" as the singer barks commands like a gas-huffing John Moschitta. Then there's ""Lola Langusta"": This re-recorded version adds a brief moment of ragtime squawk from a horn section and a little bass to make the riff swing properly, and yet it has some of the album's most tossed-off, silly lyrics, even more than ""Dog"". It's self-defeating and swaggering at once; the band wants it both ways here, and they get it. They descend into less catchy and more chaotic material, as the drum machine-driven ""Hot"" drags the band through ascending patterns in narcotic indulgence. ""Hello Friends"" sounds genuinely threatening, with it's minor-chord strum and obscured vocals evoking wires crossed and connections frazzled, like scenes in movies where you're hearing a tragedy through a walkie talkie. The record stalls occasionally, from the skippable ""Happiness"" and the version of ""Unemployment Blues"" that ambles aimlessly and maybe proves that it works best onstage, and the album does lean heavily on material stretched across previous singles-- but it remains a reward to anyone with the wherewithal to dig deeper.","Spirited French band with a fondness for noise moves from delectably trashy drum-machine punk tunes to Casio experiments that reverberate in slow, strange ways.

Carolina Funk: First in Funk 1968-1977,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c9c0084474cd0c249f/1:1/w_160/d9d98fef.jpg,2008-05-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11428-carolina-funk-first-in-funk-1968-1977/,Now AgainJazzman,"There are basically two ways to compile obscure old music: one is to focus on a story, say that of a single performer or a record label, and the other is to do an overview with sensible, if ultimately arbitrary parameters. It's possible to make a satisfying collection using either method, but you have to do it right regardless: When diligent research, good sound and good music collide on the same disc, you have the best of all worlds, and something truly worth owning. Jazzman has made something of an art form out of the latter approach with its recent geographically organized survey of impossibly rare funk. Carolina Funk follows on the fine heels of the label's Midwest, Texas, and Florida Funk overviews, dishing out 22 killer sides from late 1960s and early-to-mid-70s North and South Carolina, accompanied by 22 pages of extensive, tiny-type liners that offer more background than most people will know what to do with. The compilation covers a broad spectrum: There are hard psychedelic funk sides, funky soul songs, murky basement disco grooves, vocal harmonies, and screaming James Brown disciples, all played at skill levels ranging from confidently professional to charmingly amateur. The biggest name on the tracklisting is Carleen & the Groovers, which illustrates just how lost to time most of these tracks were. There are a couple of things seeing their first commercial release, and there is definitely a collector's penchant for rarity at work in the song choices. There's no distinct sound tying all these songs together-- if anything, the opposite is true. If there's a common thread to be found, it's that the vibrant funk scene of the Carolinas was mostly a hyper-local phenomenon, with very few of the featured musicians ever touring or receiving distribution outside their city much less their state. The disc opens with the ludicrous spoken-word intro to Primitive's ""Creation of Music"", a dorky, faux-Biblical announcement that God created music, in the manner of His famous ""let there be light"" pronouncement. And then it tears up the dance floor with a nasty rhythm guitar, twisting sax, and a burbling bass line. The skeletal groove pioneered by James Brown is all over these songs, and these bands play it hard, the often roughshod production only serving to highlight the attack of each scratchy guitar chord or well-hit snare. There are two direct homages to Carolina's #1 soul brother (JB was born in South Carolina) in Dynamite Singletary's ""Super Good"" and the Soul Impossibles' ultra-gritty ""Interpretation: Soul Power No. 1"", both of which are essentially modifications of similarly named Brown tracks. The riches sitting in the bins of Carolina flea markets are apparently plentiful, and some of these songs are just dying to be heard by audiences far larger than their 250-count pressings allowed. Wally Coco's ""Message to Society"", the most disco-fied track on the disc, is a groove monster that pleasingly combines the slick rhythms taking over the dance floors of the late 70s with garage-rock caliber production. That's hardly the craziest groove here, though-that's probably the Soul Drifters' ""Funky Soul Brother"", which opens with a stinging wah guitar riff that, along with ridiculously tight drumming, co-anchors an amazing bass line, gang vocals, and horn lines that embody the adjective ""stabbing."" The horns on Paul Burton's ""So Very Hard to Make It"" are anything but stabbing, their rich orchestration providing a creamy backdrop for Burton's smooth soul croon. If you're a fan of old-school funk, picking this compilation up is a no-brainer. If you're an old-school funk dilettante, you could still do worse-- this isn't material with limited appeal, even if it had limited impact in its day. The lack of success most of these bands experienced had a lot more to do with simple geography and economics. The various Carolina funk scenes may have been poor for cash or resources, but they were rich with creativity.","Carolina Funk follows on the fine heels of Jazzman's Midwest, Texas, and Florida Funk overviews, and it continues in the fine mold of its predecessors, dishing out 22 killer sides from the late 1960s and early-to-mid-70s North and South Carolina.

The Green Owl Comp: A Benefit for Energy Action,Various Artists,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b60a9d034d5c69bf511b/1:1/w_160/149210c3.jpg,2008-05-19 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11488-the-green-owl-comp-a-benefit-for-energy-action/,Green Owl,"It feels downright, well, uncharitable to critique a compilation put together by environmentally responsible do-gooders who are donating their profits to the Energy Action Coalition. But, it has to be said, the songs that are collected here have little to do with one another. Unlike other similarly diverse anthologies, the bands on this comp aren't connected by a unified aesthetic, label, or location; they are simply united by virtue of their altruism. How else would Harper ""Son of Paul"" Simon's dusty, spare ""Henrieta"" end up in a tracklisting with an overblown live Muse performance (replete with the noise of a screaming crowd) and an intimate Citizens Band gypsy-cabaret act? There is no throughline, no connective tissue to bind these tracks together or make listening to them as an ""album"" necessary. (In fact, you'll wonder if its creators ever made a mixtape before when you hear such jarringly disparate songs abutting one another.) But, while the sequencing may be disorienting, many of the 16 tracks on The Green Owl Comp's first disc are quite good when taken on their own. Of Montreal's ""Feminine Effects"", unavailable elsewhere, is a wonderfully torchy piano ballad à la Bowie's ""Life on Mars"". The contribution by School of Seven Bells, Benjamin Curtis' post-Secret Machines band with On!Air!Library! sisters Alejandra and Claudia Deheza, is a reverberating march of twinkling effects, glitchy Bjorkian rhythms, and insistently echoed drones of womanly harmonies. And Violens, a new project featuring Lansing-Dreiden members, may be less than a year old, but they are already the best discovery of this collection. Their stoned, sweet ""Trance Like Turn"" features sunny, vintage harmonies that peek through the gray clouds of their steely, post-punk beats and synthesized aggression. New and exclusive-- if unnecessary-- versions of already excellent songs by Feist (The Reminder's ""Honey Honey""), Deerhoof (Friend Opportunity's ""+81""), and Bloc Party (A Weekend In The City's ""The Prayer"") fill out the rest of the disc along with a couple of rough-around-the-edges tracks by the Green Owl founders' bands (the Appletrees, the Exit). The second disc bills itself as a bonus, and it's true, most of the extras are superfluous. After all, Billy Parish of Energy Action might be an environmental hero (so says Rolling Stone), but are you really going to watch a video interview with him more than once? Ditto the six low-budget music videos. But the additional tracks on disc two represent a well-spring of music. Between CSS's buzzing, electrifried remix of Asobi Seksu's ""Strawberries"" and the distorted, rhythmic antagonism of A Place to Bury Strangers' ""Never Going Down"", some of the collection's best songs are confined to this disc, which, I suspect because of its video components, I couldn't get to play in anything other than a DVD player. Despite some missteps, Green Owl Records has its heart in the right place and its fingers on the pulse. Not only do the folks behind the label recognize the need for environmentally friendly music business practices-- how many CD jewel cases must end up in landfills? Green Owl's packaging is 100% recycled-- but they have pretty good taste in bands too. In your portable music player you can remedy their egregious sequencing and ignore the handful of less-than-stellar songs. Unfortunately, the best tracks will still be trapped on that DVD.","This 2xCD-- one disc of music, one of videos-- comp for environmental awareness features an eclectic mix of musicians, including Feist, Bloc Party, Of Montreal, CSS, and Deerhoof.

Anywhere I Lay My Head,Scarlett Johansson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b63113d197565213adbb/1:1/w_160/850475bf.jpg,2008-05-19 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11522-anywhere-i-lay-my-head/,RhinoAtco,"The very idea of Scarlett Johansson's debut album has been met with a strange collective kneejerk dismissal, not so much because she's an actor making a foray into music, but she's a good actor making a foray into music. The Bijou Phillipses and David Hasselhoffs of the world, the Lindsay Lohans and Don Johnsons, have trained us to think the worst of dabblers and dilettantes. But Scarlett comes from an already storied cinema career-- Ghost World, Lost in Translation, and Match Point among the highlights-- so we assume she has better taste than to do something as gauchely commercial as make an album. Moreover, the concept behind the album-- a collection of Tom Waits covers-- might have bought her some sympathy and at least a little curiosity, but instead it seems almost comically ambitious, an endeavor that even most non-actress musicians couldn't pull off (see: Holly Cole). What could the star of The Island ever tell us about Waits that we didn't already know? Waits himself never got so much grief for appearing in studio bombs like Mystery Men or The Two Jakes. Johansson's affection for Waits' music, however, is unmistakable. Instead of obvious picks, Anywhere I Lay My Head reveals an artist with more than a passing familiarity with his work. These songs-- culled from later Waits albums like 1992's Bone Machine and 2002's Alice, with only one track from the 1970s-- sound like personal favorites, and to respectfully reinterpret them, she and producer David Sitek corralled a backing band that includes the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner and members of TV on the Radio, Tall Firs, and Celebration. Sitek proves as strong a presence as Johansson herself, swaddling her voice in a soft, otherworldly drone of bells, saxophones, ambient guitars, and burbling beats that suggest a Brooklyn update on vintage 4AD bands like This Mortal Coil or Cocteau Twins (without Elizabeth Fraser's vocal acrobatics, of course). As the album proceeds, this sound, which Sitek has described as a ""Tinkerbell on cough syrup,"" becomes a bit repetitive, the same tricks over and over. The drunken music box and ambient telephone rings on ""I Wish I Was in New Orleans"" sound overly precious, and ""I Don't Wanna Grow Up"" never gels in this setting, which may have more to do with song choice than production or performance. Sitek guides Anywhere I Lay My Head as much as Waits does. In fact, much of the album sounds like the producer might have devised this particular aesthetic as a softer, feminine counterpart to his day-job band's more aggressive, abstract attack. Music boxes replace jagged guitars, warm reed instruments displace lunar howls. Of course, Johansson doesn't take such liberties with lyrics, leaving many of the masculine pronouns unchanged. Still it's startling-- and not unpleasantly so-- to hear a guarded female voice sing words and melodies most commonly associated with Waits' gruff vocals. With all this gender realignment, David Bowie's cameos seem almost inevitable. So, how does Johansson herself sound? More expressive and less tentative than she did on ""Summertime"", her track from the 2006 Music Matters comp Unexpected Dreams: Songs From the Stars. While her voice is limited and her pitch occasionally shaky, she has a wide textural range, spanning from low, smooth, and melancholy on ""Song for Jo"" (the only original, which she co-wrote with Sitek) to bristling and edgy on ""Falling Down"", whose melody best suits her voice and Sitek's production. However, she sounds blankly inexpressive on ""No One Knows I'm Gone"", overwhelmed by her back-up singers on closer ""Who Are You"" and unable to sell Waits' lyrics on ""Town with No Cheer""-- a major shortcoming for an actor. Likewise, singing about street musicians and red-beans-and-rice on ""I Wish I Was in New Orleans"", she's out of her depth. On several songs, Johansson gets lost in Sitek's swelling production, which may suggest a weak interpreter or a dearth of vocal personality but adds to the album's pervading dreaminess. Ultimately, her ambitions prove more musical than professional, and her willingness to make herself a secondary player here-- behind Waits, Sitek, and TV on the Radio-- makes the whole enterprise seem like a lark, an anti-vanity project. There are no tacky pronouncements of stars-are-just-like-you realness here, no statements about herself or her celebrity or really anything at all. The only thing we've learned about her is that she really, really likes Tom Waits. That's more than enough to avoid catastrophe, but not quite enough to make Anywhere I Lay My Head much more than a curio.","Actress Scarlett Johansson unveils her anti-vanity vanity project, a record of Tom Waits covers (with one original) that belongs as much to its producer, TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, as it does to the Lost in Translation star. If this isn't weird enough already, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner and David Bowie are among the guests.

Travel in Herds,Hymns,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5ed9d034d5c69bf50e6/1:1/w_160/ae2a11ba.jpg,2008-05-16 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11459-travel-in-herds/,High Wire,"Big city alienation is a feeling so universal and yet so rich that nearly every re-telling of the experience still offers something new. Hymns' Travel in Herds is full of songs about displacement and loneliness, but it renders its subjects and speakers so anonymous that they fail to tap into this vein of common urban experience. Instead its vague gestures towards the contradictions and terrors of living in the city come off muted and timid. The record resonates only so far as it can rely on easy-breezy, Southern rock charm, which is too bad: Warm horns and outsider dread should make an interesting combination. Hymns, whose members live in NYC but are originally from Texas and North Carolina, recorded Travel in Herds at a Lone Star ranch with an assortment of instruments their sparser debut, 2006's Brother/Sister, lacks. Though the added timbres are welcome, saxophone, organ and banjo can't entirely make up for the lack of imagination the band employs in their structures and lyrics. Like many just-all right albums, it offers its best track, ""I Can't Be What U Want"", early on. Singer Brian Harding affably breezes through nursery-school grade rhymes over the song's New Orleans horn stabs and banjo. That same breeziness coats the whole record, even as the subject turns to cross-country ennui. Hymns keep a light touch: New York is scary, happy and/or pretty; in L.A. you've got ""nothing to lose."" ""I told you what you wanted to hear,"" Harding sings on ""Streets Alone"", and here it's smooth sax, benign and easy as the rest of the album's songs. Hymns hit something of a stride in the second half. Though the line still end in monosyllabic pap, ""Train Song"" soothes any anxieties there; you can't feel malicious toward something as pliable and watery as its pedal steel. The title track's title line-- ""We travel in herds/ We mix up our words""-- doesn't reveal anything about Hymns' intentions, but the piano march is a nice change from the acoustic alt-country goo.
Also like many just-all right albums, Travel in Herds ends with an unnecessarily long track, ""On the Run"". It's also the first time we get to hear where Hymns wanted to go. Harding raises his voice here, in something approaching anger; organs chime in behind, crescendos crescendo, then a saxophone surfs over it all, a smooth sax. While it's not exactly exhilarating, ""On the Run"" could serve as compass leading the band a little further from the comfort of home. It may not be the big city, but at least it's not the middle of the road.","Full of songs about displacement and loneliness, this Hymns album attempts to tap into the common vein of big city alienation.

Taro Tarot EP,These Are Powers,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f5b1335d7bf169a9a9/1:1/w_160/e766928f.jpg,2008-05-16 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11468-taro-tarot-ep/,HOSS,"After jetting from Liars pre-Drum's Not Dead, Pat Noecker isn't about to let his own career turn into a fool's errand. His bass teamed with ex-Liars drummer Ron Albertson, Noecker preserved Liars' rhythmic gusto with n0 Things, a band already DOA by the release of their intriguing debut. Making sure history doesn't repeat itself, Noecker's newest project These Are Powers follow up their late-2007 debut Terrific Seasons with an EP that should guarantee these self-described ""ghost-punks"" don't fade away quite so quickly. Laugh at the spectral label all you want, but Noecker's post-Liars projects, and TAP in particular, have established an MO of making very blunt, visceral rock/punk tropes feel like a vague out-of-body experience. Like the finest no wave and post-punk acts it so blatantly mined from, Terrific Seasons transmogrified stomping blues beats and tribal war dances into something that makes you wake up in a cold sweat instead of moving your feet. However, somewhere between that record and Taro Tarot, TAP's decided there's more in life than gross-out noise collages and unfeeling graveyard jams. While still a little too ungodly to capture our hearts, this EP contains ""ghost-punks"" of the Ghostbusters variety-- spooky at first but not without a mischievous charm. For all its moaning guitar parts and haunted house reverb, opener ""All Night Services"" sings the blues at its most traditional, replete with mentions of Mississippi and pulsating, if not sexy, drums. While hardly fit for a juke joint, the track recalls n0 Things's tendency to take standard song conventions and rip out their innards. ""Chipping Ice"" easily stands as TAP's most accessible song yet, downplaying the jungle drum arrangements in favor of a rapid-fire bass/snare/cymbal onslaught. Coupled with a shuffling bassline, Noecker's sassy shrieks suffer a similar fate as John Lydon's sepulchral take on disco, too catchy for nihilistic no wave, too grotesque to pass for a plausible dancefloor number. Unfortunately, after the stately harmonics fanfare of the Killing Joke-inspired ""Cockles"", the EP backslides into a more homogeneous gruel. Of course, for a seasoned noise fanatic this gruel goes down easy, but there's little distinguishing it from an Excepter or Black Dice B-side. As a trial balloon, though, Taro Tarot unequivocally succeeds. Merely a few months after their debut LP, TAP are sporting new tricks and establishing themselves as potential movers and shakers in their field rather than another footnote on Noecker's resume.","Ex-Liars and n0 Things member Pat Noecker continues here to make blunt, visceral rock/punk tropes feel like a vague out-of-body experience.

Eve Night,Les Rallizes Denudes,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4e0b1335d7bf169a7f4/1:1/w_160/3fbe6f3a.jpg,2008-05-16 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11222-eve-night/,Ignuitas,"By now, readers are familiar with Julian Cope's 1995 book Krautrocksampler, which helped rekindle appreciation of post-war German psychedelia. Thing is, most of us have never had a chance to read it, as it's looooooong out of print (Amazon's best price as of this writing is $213.10). This mirrors problems with the experimental artists Cope writes about, who often cut small-run releases for regional audiences. Listeners these days can now get re-issued Ash Ra Tempel, but many readers will have to be contented with Cope's recently-released companion piece Japrocksampler, which just so happens to feature a group of left-wing nuts named Les Rallizes Denudes. Just as with their German contemporaries, LRD remains shrouded in mystery. Formed in 1967 at Kyoto University and playing shows up until 1996, the group mingled dirge-like rhythms with piercing guitar feedback, which is easy to tell from the live document Eve Night. They incorporated acid-washed takes on sunny San Francisco psych-rock and were always guided by avant-garde Japanese theatre. Their sound played a big part in fellow countrymen Acid Mothers Temple, as well as serving as a template for the likes of Flipper and the Melvins in the States. And Les Rallizes managed to do all this while hardly touching the studio. Instead, their legend has grown on the back of monolithic performances, deafening volume, and jarring lightshows. Mythically militant, the group was known for distributing Marxist propaganda at junior high schools, and bassist Moriaki Wakabayashi was involved in the hijacking of an airliner by extremist group Sekigun. They were a group of towering guitar riffs, hard psych, inscrutable vocals, and radical ideals that simply blew away the audiences of the post-war Japanese underground. Those who know LRD today most likely heard them via one of their many live records like Eve Night, some legitimate and some bootlegged, and the group's releases remain sought-after collectors' items. But what's the big deal with these guys? Many of their available releases are the worst of bootleg tripe: badly recorded college campus shows taken from the deck of an amateur sound engineer. But Eve Night is of particular interest because it's cut of a different sort than those back-alley CD-Rs. The set, recorded at a Housei University show in 1983, is a good recording that catches the group on a damn good night. It's easier to hear the dynamic interplay between widely disparate vocals, rhythm, guitar, and bass than, say, Eve Night's concurrently re-issued 1974 companion, Are You Rallizesed? The jams, which sometimes range over twenty minutes in length, tend to initially bear some resemblance to the 1960s California sound covered on the recent Rhino compilation Love Is The Song We Sing: San Francisco Nuggets 1965-1970, which features groups like Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Front Line, and the Dead. But the heavy machinations of Les Rallizes bear more in common with their hard-psych contemporaries Hawkwind. Eve Night is a wonderful document of the group not only because it's so clear, but because it catches the subtleties of their range, which is sometimes hard to hear in low-quality bootlegs. Singer Takashi Mizutani is never spectacular, and he often seems to be trying to be less than spectacular, but on cuts like their famous dirges ""Enter the Mirror"" and ""The Last One"", he affects the voice of a lonely, wandering spirit in the throes of an existential revelation. As counterpoint, LRD's superbly fuzzy guitar lead is the mark of a group that has transcended the blues, transcended drugs, and after sixteen years, remains in an impressionistic prime. Ignuitas, the label that issued Eve Night, is similarly enigmatic. They don't have much in the way of PR, and their liner notes are frustratingly minimalist, but they've been releasing some great live LRD live shows for the last couple years. Perhaps the best thing about Eve Night is that it advances Stateside availability of LRD source material. Hopefully, it points towards the same kind of renaissance that made all those German stoners famous.","Formed in 1967 at Kyoto University and playing shows up until 1996, this Japanese group mingled dirge-like rhythms with piercing guitar feedback, incorporating acid-washed takes on sunny San Francisco psych-rock. This well-recorded 1983 live set is a cut above the innumerable semi-official bootlegs available previously.

Most Valuable Player,Nat Baldwin,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b60b13d197565213ad81/1:1/w_160/f99ffa1a.jpg,2008-05-16 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11489-most-valuable-player/,Broken Sparrow,"Upright bassist Nat Baldwin has his experimental bona fides in order. The first time I caught him live, he was playing a duet with Alex Mead on a DustBuster, and matched its on/off blasts with bowwork like a cat scratching through wicker. His bio also boasts the highlight of having studied with master composer and improviser Anthony Braxton, and if one of his homework assignments included a piece for four bassists playing in four separate galaxies-- well, I'm sure he aced it. Yet when Baldwin turned to writing and performing songs, first documented on his excellent, dire EP Lights Out, he held his improvisational chops in check to write solo, static pieces with keening vocals and dire words. His songbook has gotten catchier with time, and on his new release Most Valuable Player, he brings fierce performances to these polished compositions. ""Lake Erie"" opens the record and introduces the three main voices: Baldwin's bass, played aggressively and seizing the lead; the 12-string electric guitar of Dirty Projectors' Dave Longstreth, which wriggles and squabbles throughout the record; and Baldwin's vocals. While his singing on Lights Out took a moaning, Andrew Bird-like timbre, he's pushed himself into a more vigorous and almost hiccuping style-- and while it's probably still a work in progress, his urgent cry fuels each song. The double bass introduces most of the melodies, underpinning the more erratic addition of Longstreth's guitar. But aside from the two of them, Baldwin keeps the group lean: a bass clarinet accents the chorus on the lilting ""One Two Three"", and trumpet sputters along with the end of ""De-attached"" and gracefully accents his ballad ""Enter the Light Out"" (which you can also hear in an exquisitely tortured performance on his previous LP, Enter the Winter). Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear plays flute mellifluously on ""Black Square"", and while some moments are too luminescent-- the chorus on ""Mask I Wear"" suffers an almost treacly treatment-- most of the record is effects-free and raw. Baldwin has made his name as a bassist for Tigersaw and recently, the Dirty Projectors; Most Valuable Player was recorded around the same time and in the same living room as the stupendous Rise Above. His musical imagination is expansive, while his lack of pretense is admirable. He doesn't even make you flinch when you read that ""Look She Said""'s lyrics come from the titles of Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff compositions; and in fact, the lyrics throughout the album are brief and strong. Reports from his latest tour say that the band takes wild free excursions off this material. But capturing his work on record, Baldwin hones his work to the starkest moments: an urge by the lake, a bloodstained footprint, a whistling bow in an empty room.","Former Dirty Projector and experimental music vet takes a set of his most battle-tested material and applies raw performances to his polished compositions.

Re-Arrange Us,Mates of State,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b61713d197565213ad96/1:1/w_160/a0ac6cfb.jpg,2008-05-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11499-re-arrange-us/,Barsuk,"Considering the sort of cute overload your typical husband/wife music duo induces, Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel have done a commendable job establishing Mates of State as an original, inventive band rather than indie pop's equivalent of a lolcat. While their mid-concert kissy faces and ubiquitous canoodling press shots would seem to depict their music strictly as a product of love's labors, the duo's most intriguing draw stems from their ingenuity, consistently setting off creative lightbulbs album-after-album despite a limiting drums/keys palette. Of course, that's not to say the couple is impervious to the Sonny & Cher effect. With two newly-minted babies in two years, Gardner and Hammel must feel a rite of passage into parenthood is due, as Re-Arrange Us thoroughly redecorates the standard Mates of State sound. In Re-Arrange Us, these increasingly domesticated Mates have basically made an album to cook dinner and do the dishes to. Considering recent signs like their adorable naked PETA photo shoot, extensive blog chronicling of their daughters, and nascent experimentation with string arrangements on 2006's Bring It Back, the move to a gooey MOR aesthetic shouldn't be so surprising. The real shocker is how Gardner switches to piano after years on her trusty 1970s Electone organ, an instrument that served as her Excalibur, Mjolnir, and ""Wonder Boy"" bat all rolled into one. With his wife's sparkling arpeggios and carnival pump organ on the shelf, Hammel has no choice but to sound equally tame behind the skins, causing these songs to gently build rather than jerk the listener through one ADD idea after another. The move is especially dangerous considering how the duo's runaway-mine-car frenzy was the principal repellent of emo accusations in the past. Re-Arrange Us, bogged down in fluffy multi-instrumental arrangements and overdubbed harmonies, can't help but slow things down and do some soul searching, sometimes to a stomach-wrenching degree. While most of the tracks here don't surpass Bring It Back's lengthier durations, the added emotional and textural heft sure makes them seem longer. ""Now"", for example, softens the signature arpeggio from 2006 single ""For the Actor"" into the kind of celestial (for lack of better word) balladeering a band like Stars pulls off more effectively. Even the broken record chorus of repeated ""Now!""'s sounds oddly tranquil as both singers fly below their usual high-register yelp. Other potential dramatic peaks are similarly botched on ""Blue and Gold Print"" or ""You Are Free"", two rose-tinted lullabies hamstrung by sluggish melodies and too many held notes posing as hooks. For those fearing the duo has jumped the shark here, history shows this could just be a brief stumble. Our Constant Concern from 2002 suffered from similar ailments as this album's (e.g., uninteresting harmonies, conservative songwriting, pedestrian tempos), and the band bounced back with 2003's Team Boo, their most white-knuckled album to date. Throwbacks like ""The Re-Arranger"" and ""Help Help"" prove the Mates still possess a mischievous pop streak, especially when belting scattershot melodies over each other. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of opportunities to get caught in that lovely crossfire on Re-Arrange Us, a record that, for all its lush bells and whistles, finds the pair sounding as bare-boned and sparse as you'd expect a two-person band to be.","Far from the runaway-mine-car frenzy that defined some of their early work, the husband-and-wife duo of Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel opt for slower tempos, multi-instrumental arrangements, and overdubbed harmonies on their fifth full-length.

Deep in the Woods,Dragged By Horses,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b57b5e6ef95969322793/1:1/w_160/256b0e82.jpg,2008-05-15 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11355-deep-in-the-woods/,Highwheel,"Dragged by Horses are a three-piece out of Humboldt County, Calif., far to the north of the state. At the county's southernmost point, it's still 225 miles from San Francisco, and much of the area could safely be called rural-- not much to speak of but a couple of colleges, strong weed, and a bunch of giant redwoods. The band's heaviness is just as elemental and matter-of-fact as their forest surroundings, but their sound is a little more nervous, and nods further south: to San Diego, home of Drive Like Jehu, who are clearly a compass point for this young band. They don't share the complex riffs and odd time signatures of DLJ, but they have the tone down, and are heavy without resorting to any raucous distortion, double bass-drum attacks, or quiet-to-loud; theirs is a much more subtle style of bludgeoning. More than that, without the use of laid-back surfer signifiers or sweetened Beach Boy-styled harmonies, they still manage to represent their zip code. If only the whole of Deep in the Woods lived up to the promise of its first track. ""Queen of the Nile"" has an ominous drum patter that unwinds as slow as its circular guitar riff and creeping bass line, while singer Pablo Midence and some barely audible piano chords are drops in a bottomless bucket of open space. The guitars up the attack and the drums hit harder, but there's no explosion, just a swell in volume that recedes as quickly and unceremoniously as it started. ""Mas Por Dinero"" is earthy and oppressive like the best stoner-rock, but nervier and more prone to full band stop-starts, and with a mix of Spanish and English in the Midence's barked lyrics. ""One Way Ticket to Rome"" has a similar kind of tension between its elastic riff and the jerks and heaves of the rhythm section, but as the record progresses, the sharp dynamics alone can't overcome the uniform sound of the record as a whole. ""The Need to Fight"" sustains tension with build-ups and fake-outs, but tracks like ""Snailshine"" or ""Depth Charge"" don't have much resonance beyond the initial stun of their tricky rhythm (not to mention limber drumming throughout). ""1,000,000"" sneaks in a memorable hook near the record's end, and if they could take advantage of open space as they did at the album's start, and were Midence to grow as a guitarist and incorporate more melody, the band could easily grow beyond their influences and their surroundings. As is, Deep in the Woods has an enticing sound with a few great tracks.","Mathy Humboldt County, Calif., band debuts with an album that's heavy without resorting to raucous distortion or double bass-drum attacks.

Lie in Light,Cloudland Canyon,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5eac0084474cd0c24d8/1:1/w_160/6a318068.jpg,2008-05-15 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11457-lie-in-light/,Kranky,"Talk about wearing your influences on your sleeve. Cloudland Canyon's second LP, Lie in Light, opens with a song called ""Krautwerk"", conflating a band and a genre so closely related that the pun verges on tautology. But Kraftwerk were futurists. Cloudland Canyon are more atavistically inclined, more Can than Kraftwerk. They want order within chaos, not instead of it, and on ""Krautwerk"", they mask their Krautrock homage in the Velvet Underground's patented blend of rock guitars and primordial ooze. ""Krautwerk"" takes its time making its point: A long celestial blackout courts transcendental bliss, before the shaggy techno-organic rhythm, noodly guitars, and submerged incantations give shape to the void. At seven minutes, it also wears out its welcome before it departs, as it's hard to get into the song's liminal groove (which all of Cloudland Canyon's music strives to find) when the title's already told you exactly where it's going. Happily, Cloudland Canyon's Kip Uhlhorn (Panthers, Red Scare) and Simon Wojan (King Khan & the Shrines) veer away from the cumbersome Krautrock template for most of Lie in Light. But the sense that they're trying to lasso lightning persists, and unifies the otherwise-eclectic album. In naming themselves after a state park in Georgia, the band seems less interested in naturalistic allegory than the resonance of the words themselves: The image of a canyon filled with clouds is terrific shorthand for the vastness of their sound. On ""White Woman"", droning walls of shoegaze guitar feel at once impregnable and vaporous, like you could put your hand right through them. As noise-pop jams go, it's powerful; but like ""Krautwerk"", it feels a bit telegraphed, its intensity levels rising and falling exactly where you'd expect. Bludgeoning stasis seems close to Cloudland Canyon's collective heart, yet when they loosen up and let their music move a little, they excel. Lie in Light really hits its stride with the third track, the spongy electro jam ""You & I"", which lets go of daunting stasis and finds the band tapping into a deep corporeal groove: I like hearing that spirit, the prioritization of the moment over posterity, that spontaneity and wantonness-- the record could use more of both. ""You & I"" is Lie in Light's unquestionable apex, and it's perfectly sequenced in the middle of the album: after an upward climb and a thrumming climax, we begin the downward slide into less blatantly ecstatic tracks. If you took three or four Angelo Badalamenti scores and layered them all on top of each other, you might wind up with something very similar to ""Scheisse Schatzi, Auf Wiedersehen!"", a sonic analog to a dissociative fugue. An idyllic krautrock passage flares up like a muscle memory amid the cosmic gusts of ""Heme"", and the impenetrable title track, all drones and concussions, slams down with apocalyptic finality: no discernible guitars, no isolated rhythms, no verbal semiotics, just a long, loud, obliterative ending.",,6.4,
All Together,Pattern Is Movement,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f3b1335d7bf169a9a2/1:1/w_160/903f8cc8.jpg,2008-05-15 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11466-all-together/,Hometapes,"""Oh, I just like the sound of your voice."" This is Pattern Is Movement's Andrew Thiboldeaux, on ""Sound of Your Voice"", singing to someone never clearly identified. Is it a lover? An enemy? A friend? It doesn't matter who the object of his sonic affection is in the context of the song, because the line functions more as a manifesto for Thiboldeaux's band, which was once a quintet but is now down to a duo of him and drummer Chris Ward. By the warped internal logic that guides PIM's music, ""I just like the sound of your voice"" could be a reason to love someone until death. Pattern Is Movement is all about sound, or rather sounds, plural. Their music is best described as modular, building complete songs from sub-units of melody and beat. The result is out there, but it doesn't seem pretentious because of the giddy single-mindedness with which the band attacks the concept-- it's the sound of the voice he likes and not the person speaking-- the voice isn't used to tell a story. It's used as an instrument, the same way everything else is in their music-- which these days consists mostly of drums and a big pile of vintage keyboards-- is used. The album opens with a sudden burst of strangely contoured melody; Ward brings in a sharp rock beat shortly after the opening fanfare, re-contextualizing the melody rhythmically, as Thiboldeaux surrounds his own voice with a keyboard-generated choir. The song builds and builds to an abrupt ending. Ward alternately uses his drums to pull all the disparate phrases together in a steady rhythm and as yet another phrase to fit into the overall interlocking pattern. On ""Trolley Friend"", he does both, creating a simple beat to shepherd the bubbling keyboard phrases and lava flow bass into a neat rhythm track and then delivering a thunderous tom roll to back the chorus, if the stuttering, off-kilter section of the song that follows the beat-driven section can be described as such. If nothing else, swings such as these demonstrate how well the band has honed its sense of drama. ""Sylvia"" offers further testament, delivering arcing vocal phrases over a steady beat and constantly shifting keyboard textures that continually cast the vocals in a new light. It takes special musicians to make a sound like this work, but three LPs into their career, Thiboldeaux and Ward seem to have it figured out, creating an accessible album that nonetheless sounds unlike anything any other band is doing. Scott Solter, co-producing the band for the second time, has the sound figured out as well, lending the album a clear, direct character that emphasizes the contrasts between density and sparseness at the heart of PIM's work.","Three records into its career, this mathy Philadelphia outfit has created an accessible album that nonetheless sounds unlike what any other band is doing.

You Cross My Path,The Charlatans UK,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b58f5e6ef959693227ba/1:1/w_160/8c73a254.jpg,2008-05-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11373-you-cross-my-path/,self-released,"The box office numbers don't justify the possibility of a Walk Hard sequel, but if a British version were to be made, you could find worse inspirations than the Charlatans UK. Yeah, their timeline doesn't have any sort of linear sense to it, but their phases are plenty distinct: Madchester, Britpop, Dylan, Stones and even a bizarre Club Med reggae interlude (2006's Simpatico). For a change of pace, You Cross My Path doesn't actually align itself with any sort of trend other than free availability on the internet, and to hear the band tell it, that was the most likely result for this project all along. It's pretty representative of the dichotomy existent within You Cross My Path: as possibly their strongest work since Tellin' Stories, it's something that the Charlatans UK can expect to favorably speak for itself, but it will likely hold ""members only"" interest for the brave souls who've followed their every move this whole time-- the type that use terms like ""their strongest work since Tellin' Stories."" It's a problem that's sorta out of their control; had this been released in 2000 by newcomers, it likely could have fallen into the hands of Brit enthusiasts that were fucking with the likes of South and Elbow back when ""the next Coldplay"" didn't quite have as many pejorative connotations. Think of it as a Greatest Hits collection that doesn't contain actual hits, or at the very least, a fake retrospection that has all of their trajectories meeting up at the same intersection. And while it might result in one of the more seamless works of recent Charlatanism, ""seamless"" could also pass for ""meh."" The building blocks are still readily identifiable-- Tim Burgess' nasal bray can still inject a good degree of sneer into lines like ""you're no friend of mine"" and otherwise sell the overly wordy and schlocky rhine-Stones hook of the title track. And if you can prominently feature Hammonds without sounding like Rami Jaffee is on your payroll, more power to you. Thing is, when you combine everything these guys have done into one ten-track platter, you get an unfavorable situation where survivors decades deep in the game sound like they're trying to play catch-up with the last two Stills albums. The band's always had a tangential relationship with dance music, so it's strange to hear them so out of step. Take ""Missing Beats (Of A Generation)""-- while hurtling forward with the record's greatest sense of purpose, the parenthetical likely refers to a time around 1998, which is approximately the year Kula Shaker might have been looking to latch on their B-3 trillings to a safe jungle beat. Not insular enough for ya? I'm fairly certain ""My Name Is Despair"" is a reference to a Rob Dickinson solo track, and I'm fairly certain that its hacked, syncopated drum pattern and phone-booth vocals were swimming around in DJ Shadow's inbox during the Psyence Fiction sessions. ""The Misbegotten"" cribs ""Blue Monday"" a bit more tastefully than Orgy did, but as far as ""Bird/Reprise"" goes, get Peter Hook drunk and he'll swear he played bass on it. Problem is, for many people this will feel like a career summation in that it's all very competent, but lacking a certain personality, something that would cause other bands to be compared to the Charlatans UK as opposed to the other way around; a record that's most likely to be definitive. So really, it's difficult to determine whether You Cross My Path is a victim of the times or its own merits; it's the sort of thing that's so competent that it's more likely to be defined by its failures than its success. Unlike a similarly shapeshifting outfit like Primal Scream, Charlatans UK never flew high enough to be legendary or fell off to a point where a comeback would be interesting, and maybe they're sensing that they can only play the survivor card for so long. The album closes with, you guessed it, ""This Is the End"", which sounds like defiance (""I will never be put down/ I will only be set free""), but is unclear in intent. Burgess claims ""it's the end of you and me,"" but it can easily be mistaken for a state of the Charlatans address.","Tenth album by the long-running outfit, available as a free download, has all of the band's trajectories-- Madchester, Stones-inspired classic rock, Britpop-- meeting up at the same intersection.

ExitingARM,Subtle,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6229d034d5c69bf5148/1:1/w_160/1cf3db31.jpg,2008-05-15 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11510-exitingarm/,Lex,"ExitingARM is Subtle's ""pop"" album. And by that they mean it's their most accessible album to date, and an answer to a problem that's plagued them since they started: How do you make something dense and personal, a body of work that demands time and dedication-- and then hook a wide new audience, hang onto their ears, and make them understand it? Their new album highlights what's always been catchiest about Subtle's music: it's full of short, fast bangers that you can enjoy out of the corner of your ear. But scratch the surface, and you find something far gnarlier-- the most intricate realization yet of the vision of frontman Doseone, a.k.a. rapper, poet and visual artist Adam Drucker. ExitingARM is the latest chapter in the story of Hour Hero Yes, the middle-class rapper whose rise and struggles are chronicled told on 2004's A New White and 2006's For Hero: For Fool. It's hard to talk about ""what happens"" in a story that fluidly moves between fiction, memoir, and surrealism, but nevertheless: at the end of For Hero: For Fool, Hour Hero Yes drops through a door and into a world that's a twisted version of our own. As soon as he lands, he's captured by the Ungodz, Revered Pitman and Dr. MoonorGun. They lock him in their keep and force him to crank out perfect pop songs, while he sneaks out subversive messages that tell the truth about what's going on. But these records also tell the story of Subtle, and their quest to break out of the alt-hip-hop/Wire feature niche where they've all lived for so long. Leaving behind their first bedroom-project EPs and the lo-fi A New White, they've become aggressive and astonishing-- and still bleeding edge. Too textural for top 40, with beats too hard for the experimental bin, the new album draws on the same palette as before: they're still a sextet with drums and drum machines, synths and laptops, Dax Pierson (still contributing, via Ableton Live, after the van accident that rendered him quadriplegic), guitar and woodwinds where they need them, a full-time cellist, and Doseone's vocals-- which are gruff, high, gibbering, bragging, and blissful. From the kraut-rock throb of ""Day Dangerous"" to the closing drift of ""Providence"", the arrangements take fewer left turns and ace hooks-- an aching falsetto harmony, a riff on an analog keyboard-- sweeten every song. Yet Doseone didn't skip the hard parts: instead, he split the project across two media-- the record, and a Flash website loaded with drawings, simple animations, and hidden poems, that'll run up to 20,000 words and spell out the mythology in unprecedented depth. The website and the records expand on one another. To take one example, flip to chapter one of the almanac (""Ungodz Splay"") and click around until you find ""Trouble in Anchorage""; then listen to ExitingARM's ""The Crow,"" this time knowing where the bird came from. If this all sounds heavy, it's because you're not listening to Doseone deliver it. He speaks and raps in a highly-refined style that I'll refer to as a cant. It's built on free associations and quick, complex metaphors delivered at disturbing speed, and disjointed with contradictions and negatives, with lots of ""not""-this, or ""un""-that. Read the lyric sheet cold, and it's impenetrably abstract-- yet the sound of the language is pleasing for its own sake, which puts him right on the shelf between Ulysses and Dr. Seuss. The album boasts the most opaque lyrics in Subtle's catalog. But put the record and the website together, and the big themes become clear. Hour Hero Yes is a middle-class hero who fights apathy and consumerism. Critiques of America come in forms both obvious (""red white and blind"") and cryptic (the fork is ""the spirit animal of the American consumer,"" as he told blogger Mr. Mammoth). The Headache Twins, who are the heads of music television and rulers of ""the commodified world,"" are obviously the bad guys, and Hour Hero Yes wants to reverse the apathy that drags us toward ""the terrible great nothing much."" Everyone still alive is called a ""goner,"" and as Dose puts it, twice: ""Q: what's working man's hope? A: they call it cope."" But consider Hour Hero Yes'-- and really, Doseone's-- stake in this struggle. Hour Hero Yes has been forced to write hit pop songs, but his songs do not include the word ""I."" They're anonymous, and Hour Hero Yes can only communicate through hidden messages in the lyrics, which means he keeps himself a secret in his own work: they are pop songs that come without a pop star. Which is exactly what Doseone has done on ExitingARM. The man behind these lyrics has paid his dues and wants the rewards. As he told Pitchfork last fall, ""the knife is in our teeth."" But if Dose is really after fame, he's chosen an elusive path to the top. Doseone has spent his career documenting the inner monologues, hidden secrets, and unnamable anxieties that we all feel, but don't put in words. We murmur this stuff in our heads on the train home, in our bedrooms where we hide in books and pick at our bodies. We all have our own cant, yet we never let ourselves use it. Instead, we settle for a common language-- and as Dose argues, that language gets simpler and cruder all the time. You can complain that Americans talk in pop culture references, but when's the last time you tried to express anything more private? Dose wrote a lyric about the moles on his penis; have you? Doseone is a confessional artist by nature. But where most indie confessors sell themselves as ""just like us,"" Doseone never will-- which is why his ""poppiest"" disc to date is also his toughest. While he gladly lets us into his head, he's not here to commiserate, so much as lead. He's not your new pop hero: rather, he's cast himself as an avatar, the patron saint of diary-scribblers, and penis-mole-pickers, and world-crushed workers. And the knife is in his teeth.",,8.3,
Truth & Soul: Fallin' Off the Reel II,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5e35e6ef95969322855/1:1/w_160/35f69eff.jpg,2008-05-14 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11450-truth-soul-fallin-off-the-reel-ii/,Truth & Soul,"Truth & Soul may have been founded in 2004, but it works more like an old-school soul label, with a collective of musicians playing in the studio and contributing to each other's records. About all that's missing is the authoritarian businessman. Instead, label founders Leon ""El"" Michels and Jeff Silverman are musicians and enthusiasts for the days when Revilot, Atco, Brunswick, Motown, Vee-Jay, Stax, and others filled the bins with 45s. They even seem enthusiastic about the 45 format itself, having steadily released a small flood of them over the past four years. If you missed out on those-- most were issued in small batches-- or simply don't own a record player, here's your chance to get caught up: This is the second volume compiling their 45s, this one covering everything from 2006 forward (they haven't made a big deal out of it, but vinyl lovers who buy the double LP are treated to quite a few bonus tracks, a nice nod and wink to their main constituency). The singles are presented chronologically, which works fine. The Bronx River Parkway single that starts things off is a strong opener. This venerable Latin soul band goes back for decades, and their two 45s are highlights of the compilation. ""La Valla"" is a perfect exercise in sharp 1970s-style funk, with staccato verses full of economical horn, bass, and guitar parts and legato choruses that let the horns stretch out more melodically. The bare-bones production suits it well. Other highlights include veteran soul singer Lee Fields' ""Love Comes and Goes"", which backs his gritty soul shout with a large chorus of singers-- an unusual texture that gives the song a participatory feel, as though these people were just sitting around and couldn't help singing along. El Michels Affair checks in with four good tracks, and these are where the compilation deviates most from its revivalist sound template. ""PJ's"", featuring Wu-Tang's Raekwon, is excellent live-band hip-hop with a great, icy keyboard hook. Previously unreleased bonus track ""Odyssey Revised"", by the Fabulous Three, is driven along by a burbling bass line and has a three-part horn arrangement to die for. It sounds like something that could've come out on Strata in the early 70s. There are a few tracks that don't hit the mark, most notably the two Motown covers. Timothy McNealy's version of ""What's Going On"" is muddled and loses the immediacy of the original by falling short of its grace (the B-side, a country-soul cover of Al Green's ""I'm So Glad You're Mine"", fares much better) and the Funky Music Machine drains all the air from the Four Tops' ""I Can't Help Myself"". It mostly just makes me miss Levi Stubbs.

Poisonous Times,The Old Haunts,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5e1c0084474cd0c24cb/1:1/w_160/78181f2b.jpg,2008-05-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11448-poisonous-times/,Kill Rock Stars,"""I am on strike,"" Craig Extine announces late in ""Volatile"", from the Old Haunts' third full-length, Poisonous Times. It's a curious declaration, especially on the opening track, suggesting that there won't be an album to follow. However, for the Old Haunts, music is a form of picketing, not something to picket against. They're on a small label that's local to them; they tour determinedly but play independent venues; they have very few, if any, corporate connections. On their first two releases, the EP collection Fallow Field and the follow-up Fuel on Fire, they expressed a general unease with the world, alternately outraged and disgusted not only with the course of society, but-- more interestingly-- by their own inability to halt or redirect it, or even simply to remove themselves from it. That frustration sparked their minimal No Logo indie punk. Poisonous Times further refines and reshapes it. Of course, there's a new drummer on Poisonous Times. Each release has introduced a new one to the band: This time it's Tobi Vail, formerly of Bikini Kill, who let's hope stays on for a few albums. She's perhaps the best yet, allowing the Old Haunts to tighten up their already compressed sound and to move in some new directions. After Extine lays down the album's best curlicue riff at the beginning of stand-out ""Hurricane Eyes"", she enters at almost double-time, completely opening up the song's possibilities. Her galloping rhythms push ""Outside of Divided Time"" at a pent-up midtempo. Extine seems to be stretching as well: ""Hang Up on the Downside"" is a rare acoustic number, although Scott Seckington's lurching bass preempts any ballad pretensions. Their most diverse release yet, Poisonous Times finds new directions to deploy the Old Haunts' brutally spare attack, highlighting their swampy existentialism on ""Ruined View"", their mellower side on ""Sunshine"", and the spacey guitars on ""Sister City"". There's a tension in these songs that strenuously conveys the paranoia and agitation in Extine's lyrics, yet over the course of the album, that dynamic occasionally flags as too many of these songs run on long after they've presented and re-presented their ideas. There's a great two-and-a-half-minute single in ""Volatile"", which unfortunately clocks in at four and a half minutes. And no way should ""In Revolt"" or ""Knives on the Mind"" or really any song on Poisonous Times exceed three and a half minutes tops. As the band grows increasingly adventurous, Extine is writing punchier hooks on ""Ruined View"" and ""Hurricane Eyes"", but they get lost in the sprawl of these arrangements, which give this album a slightly undisciplined feel that ultimately dilutes the impact of the band's protest.","On their third full-length, Poisonous Times, Old Haunts add former Bikini Kill drummer Tobi Vail to tighten up their already compressed sound.

Faint at the Loudest Hour,Alexander Turnquist,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b59cc0084474cd0c2451/1:1/w_160/2ee047f4.jpg,2008-05-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11386-faint-at-the-loudest-hour/,VHF,"Faint at the Loudest Hour collects six pieces for acoustic guitar recorded by Idaho musician Alexander Turnquist in a small studio in rural North Carolina in late autumn 2006. Don't let the signifiers fool you: Though based on beautiful acoustic guitar music, very little about Faint at the Loudest Hour is pure, conservative, or provincial. Instead, by embedding both new age and noise-oriented electronic themes into his pastoral pieces, Turnquist unites disparate traditions and ideals, essentially employing sonic counterweights to construct 57 minutes that are as surprisingly dynamic as they are perfectly beautiful. The cover of Faint at the Loudest Hour is a detail from a shot included in Turnquist's photography series, Broken Reflections. Using a jagged handheld mirror, Turnquist simultaneously captures the scene in front of the lens and something just behind it. In this shot, a visage of knotty, bare branches and blue sky is interrupted by a mirror reflecting more of the same-branches, a sky that's several shades darker, and white splotches (snow?) that disrupt the disruptive image. As the process-based cover and the paradoxical title suggest, Faint explores and interconnects disparate motifs and methods, essentially taking one ""picture"" and making it more provocative through juxtaposition and mixing. The dominant guitar style here, for instance, employees long, uninterrupted billows of notes in conflicting high and low registers, much like James Blackshaw's The Cloud of Unknowing. But Turnquist occasionally plays in a more percussive style suggestive of Leo Kottke, Michael Hedges, or the contemporary Kaki King. At its best, the guitar work meets those methods in the middle, when Turnquist is executing beyond a singular stylistic comfort. Similarly, Turnquist undermines some of the disc's most pristine acoustic moments with drones and howls and floods of electronic sound. Assisted by producer and tape wizard Scott Solter, these non-traditional textures are the real counter-reflective glory on Faint at the Loudest Hour. Opener ""Amongst a Swarm of Hummingbirds"" unfurls a dexterous 12-string guitar stream, Turnquist shaping minor-chord explorations into an arching anthem. Suddenly, the theme is gone, sucked into a blissful vortex of coruscated tape swells, the resplendence tempered with noisy clicks and muted roars beneath. When the guitar re-emerges, it aggresses, less patient and romantic with the pattern now. By track's end, both a bowed lap steel and a trance-like beat have clawed at the acoustic theme. Aside from the sheer beauty and power of Turnquist's compositions, his biggest accomplishment may be the use of one conflicting form to accent previously overlooked aspects of another. The three-minute wash of tidal electronics that opens ""Water Spots Upon My Mind"", for example, professes the talents of Turnquist and producer Solter. More importantly, though, it reveals the slow waves of melody written into Turnquist's long-form songs by massaging the attack of the guitar's notes into smooth hills and valleys. That is, by stripping all of the notes away, Turnquist let's us see the forest without having to identify the trees. For such an accomplished player, the move is almost altruistic. Likewise, an electronic haze dotted by vibraphone and taps against the hollow body of a guitar opens ""In the Vein of Bedlam"". The eerie improvisation hovers, torpid, setting the mood for the brusque picking that overtakes it. Turnquist sounds indignant and troubled, but the key of his anger matches that of the piece's intro. The first four minutes, then, were the sound of his ire taking shape. Because of that prelude, what would have sounded only like an intricate, ominous moment of 12-string guitar sounds more like a story. Connecting is easier. Inevitably, Turnquist's multi-instrumental ambition sometimes gets the best of him. He emphasizes themes to the point of redundancy or didactism at points, like the return to electronics on the otherwise brilliant ""Water Spots Upon My Mind"". But, much like Mike Tamburo's 2006 The Ghosts of Marumbey and Fennesz's 2001 Endless Summer, Faint at the Loudest Hour proclaims that the intersection of guitar heroics and electronics craftsmanship is vital.","While based on acoustic guitar, very little about the album is pure, conservative, or provincial; instead, Turnquist embeds both new age and noise-oriented electronic themes into his pastoral pieces.

Way,Ecstatic Sunshine,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b614c0084474cd0c251e/1:1/w_160/895f44e1.jpg,2008-05-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11495-way/,Cardboard,"Exceptions certainly abound, but the much-celebrated musical mess coming from Baltimore for the last several years seems to have been successful in part because it augmented outsider sounds with the tension of playfulness: Dan Deacon's kaleidoscopic electronic music sounds like the sweat of a man who has chased too much tie-dye must taste, and the sometimes maudlin, sometimes awesome a cappella send-ups of Lexie Mountain Boys incorporate grunts, wails, and claps into songs about chicken and cheese. Perhaps you remember Baltimore ex-pats Animal Collective singing sweetly against college for 53 seconds on Sung Tongs? Or, more recently, how fellow Interstate 95 North travelers Yeasayer named their debut All Hour Cymbals and-- apocalypse-obsessed or no-- managed to squeeze some humor into such questionable times. Video Hippos? Ponytail? Santa Dads? All funny names for interesting music. While jokes are one thing, jocular mischief embedded within provocative, exploratory, erudite music is another: Deacon has dual degrees in electro-acoustic and computer music from New York's Purchase College, and he admits that he wants his tunes to work both at parties and on headphones. I watched Boys ringleader Lexie Mountain run with some of the top names in noise at a festival last year, and I think Ponytail's forthcoming debut, Ice Cream Spiritual, is one of the more agile and enterprising instrumental rock records of the year. It just happens to be lined with playful vocal outbursts and antiphonies. Enter Ecstatic Sunshine, a Baltimore band that was, until sometime last year, the guitar duo of Dustin Wong and Matt Papich. The two met in a Baltimore arts school in 2004, and, by 2006, they'd released two albums of well-rehearsed, tightly executed mini-suites for guitar. The counterpoints were colorful and quick, and both the pace and crunchy, thin guitar tones spoke more to house parties than conservatories. But while the music glowed and winked like the band's name, the pair's instrumentals were complex and precise. They weren't getting by on mere concept. Wong left Ecstatic Sunshine last year to focus full-time on Ponytail, but, before his departure, he and Papich invited another art school friend, Kieran Gillen, to join on electronics, mixing and sampling both guitar lines in real-time. This incarnation of Ecstatic Sunshine recorded Way, the band's third LP and first for Cardboard Records. Where the guitarmonies and action arches of 2004's New Kind of Imagination and 2006's Freckle Wars were playful to the fault of a shtick, Way pulls back to the other side. Here, ornamental guitar lines converge and crackle into coruscated power drones or beam by like rainbows in curved air. Some would say it's ""serious"" music. Some moments shimmer: Opener ""B"" immediately sounds like the old Ecstatic Sunshine, rigorous guitar lines pinging off of one another in a bright sonic space. But the familiar sound gets jostled in the speakers, alternately amplified and undercut by Gillen's electronics and guitar playing that's not trying to impress would-be guitar heroes now. The sounds stretch, clip, reverse, circuit: Imagine Music for Airports on amphetamines (that is, still sort of slow) or the Field with cough syrup instead of drum machines. Other moments abrade, albeit lightly: ""B"" empties gently into ""Herrons"", which floats thin, pretty guitar tones into small little circles. A grey band of noise leaks across the channels, overtaking the track just before the 30-second mark. Skip to a random point along the rest of the seven-minute track, and the sound may jar you. But start again, and notice Ecstatic Sunshine's accomplishment. By slowly mixing in the noise and always keeping those astral whirs within earshot, they make the slow ascent into abrasion welcoming and, in a way, gentle. Fully committed to that idea, it's a perfect track. Previous fans will no doubt lament the loss of the quirkier, two-piece Ecstatic Sunshine, especially because an LP that sounds exactly as transitional as it is serves as the duo's obituary. Papich has indicated that the band is headed even further out, and he's added another electronicist, David Zimmerman. When I saw the trio play in March, they were heavier and more risky than I'd ever heard them. Indeed, more exciting than a band capable of churning out endless cheeseball anthems for two electric guitars is the band capable of doing such and running in the opposite direction. Way is a humble first step in what sounds like a glorious new trip, where the really well played guitar becomes something else entirely. Fear not: Especially on closer ""Perrier"", which moves from subliminal washes of sound to a full-on, distortion-up, rock-out coda in 10 minutes, that suggest endless possibilities, Ecstatic Sunshine still cherish the transcendent and the playful. After all, how can a band with a name like that ever be completely serious?","With new members comes a new direction for this instrumental Baltimore band; where earlier records were lighter and more playful, here ornamental guitar lines converge and crackle like rainbows in curved air.

Silent Movie,Quiet Village,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b612c0084474cd0c2517/1:1/w_160/36837a36.jpg,2008-05-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11493-silent-movie/,!K7,"The thin line between schmaltz and beauty is something musicians have had to grapple with for a while, especially during a generation of pop where recontextualization is something we tend to take for granted. Right now I'm listening to ""Victoria's Secret,"" the first track from Quiet Village's Silent Movie, and I'm imagining other people in a similar situation squinching up their faces at how cheesily doe-eyed it must sound to them: beachside surf sounds and seagull keening, weepy strings, a sedate, molasses-flow rhythm section that consists of an almost inaudible feather-tapped drum and a snore-pace bass. It sounds like some long-forgotten slab of incidental music from a pay-for-use soundtrack library, composed in the hopes that some TV movie pulls it from the stacks to score a chaste falling-in-love scene. Except that most of this song's structure actually comes from a hauntingly lovelorn and classic Chi-Lites ballad, 1972's ""The Coldest Days of My Life""-- and once you know that, it gets harder to hear ""Victoria's Secret"" as strictly cheese, especially once you recognize Eugene Record's voice echoing through the tides. Silent Movie has a field day with this tweaking of the margins between extravagant easy listening and the more ""proper"" strains of pop and r&b, the result being a record that betrays the frequently subjective notion of what ""kitsch"" consists of. Quiet Village is a project of Matt Edwards, best known as tech-house auteur Radio Slave, and collaborator Joel Martin, whose pre-Quiet Village activity consists most significantly of his hand in compiling Bite Hard, a cult-classic compilation of 1970s library music from Britain's De Wolfe Studio. What they've come up with has frequently been lumped in with the Balearic revival movement, which relies in part on a sort of sun-baked, slow-moving codeine-disco vibe that (despite my best efforts) largely defies easy classification. Most of the prime examples of this are found in the tracks that originated as 12"" single sides back in 2005 and 2006, which also comprise most of Silent Movie's rhythmic pulse. The leisurely, palm-lined slow cruise of ""Pillow Talk"" lifts from select bits of the 1978 Alan Parsons Project album Pyramid and then blows out its guitar-driven downtempo AOR slickness into an even heavier, thicker sheen of ambient coke-prog. It leads cleanly into the single it was originally the 2005 B-side to, the coming-down funk of ""Can't Be Beat"", and by slowing Trade Mark's Franco-disco ""Days of Pearly Spencer"" (also from 1978) to a woozy crawl they create a particularly tense and bleary brand of late-nite post-club slow jam, an atmosphere shared by the electric piano-driven, Captain and Tenille-monologue-appropriating dope haze of second single ""Too High to Move"". The notable exception to all this blissful dancefloor torpor is a bit of bikers-versus-zombies drive-in-movie fare called ""Circus of Horror"", the most uncharacteristic (and maybe the best) song on the record: in the simplest terms, it's blatant Tarantino bait that sounds like Hendrix's Band of Gypsys after developing some kind of Italian soundtrack fetish, and it's the one moment on the record where the drums not only really come alive but threaten to tumble down directly on top of you. The funny (and problematic) thing is, a lot of these songs, especially the newer tracks, aren't that heavily altered in comparison to its subjectively tacky source material. ""Utopia"" is essentially Andreas Vollenweider's ""Steam Forest"" with some bits switched here and there to disguise its new age origins; the tribal spaghetti Western rumble of ""Gold Rush"" draws liberally from late-60s psych band Writing on the Wall's ""Buffalo""; ""Pacific Rhythm"" basically is Ryuichi Sakamoto's version of Sister Sledge's Chic-gone-reggae deep cut ""You're A Friend to Me"". Think of Silent Movie more as an edits and remixes record-- or even a reproduced DJ set-- than a sample pastiche, and maybe it'll feel less larcenous, though I can't imagine that the people left disillusioned by the revelation that Daft Punk didn't write the riff to ""Digital Love"" will be all that thrilled. Maybe there's a different divide to worry about here: it's not a matter of whether the music is cheesy, but whether the appropriation is. Strange how an album that invites scenesters to overcome their aversion to AOR slickness trips them up by playing against moral codes concerning authenticity and proper credit. At worst, this just makes Silent Movie a kind of stealth mix CD (see also Rub-n-Tug's 2006 Balearic progenitor mix Better With a Spoonful of Leather). At best, they've just compiled the soundtrack to the finest 3 a.m. trip home you'll have all year.","The thin line between schmaltz and beauty is something musicians have had to grapple with for a while.

Warchild,Emmanuel Jal,by: Ben Westhoff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5e7ea9e61561daa6e9f/1:1/w_160/c6c00a5b.jpg,2008-05-13 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11454-warchild/,InterscopeFontanaSonic 360,"South Sudan refugee Emmanuel Jal was forced into the Sudan People's Liberation Army when he was six or seven years old (he doesn't know his age), reportedly carrying an assault rifle that was bigger than he was and fighting in the country's second civil war. With the help of a British aid worker he was smuggled into Kenya and eventually made it to London, where he became an internationally-renowned gospel hip-hop artist. Warchild is Jal's second album with a wide commercial release, and it coincides with screenings of a new documentary about his life. A few of the CD's songs deal with the horrors he witnessed as a child. ""Friends like Lual/ Who died by my side from starvation in the baron jungle and the desert plains,"" he raps on ""Forced To Sin"". ""Next was I but Jesus heard my cry/ As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade."" But the album is less concerned with conflict in his native country than was his extraordinary 2005 collaboration with North Sudan musician Abdel Gadir Salim, Ceasefire. At the time of its release Jal was already popular in parts of Africa due to hits like ""All We Need Is Jesus"" and ""Gua"" (the latter a very nifty piece of pop which also appears on Ceasefire), while Salim was a multi-instrumentalist known for both his traditional and urban North Sudanese sounds. By uniting acclaimed performers on both sides of the civil war's divide, Ceasefire was a political statement at its core, and the music was transcendent as well, highlighted by Salim's stunning folk arrangements and oud playing. On that album, Jal rapped in a variety of languages including Arabic, Nuer, and Kiswahili, but Warchild is almost entirely in English, and much of it concerns his struggles in the first world. Afro-pop jam ""Baaki Wara"", the most compelling track, is about groupies and sexual temptation. ""My flesh and my spirit are always fighting/ This evening I met a lady called Daniela/ She is tall, beautiful with smooth skin like roasted beans /...Few hours later I met her friends Jamilla and Amila."" Hearing Jal speak on culture shock and sudden fame is more interesting (to me, anyway) than hearing him speak on his childhood-- although perhaps my cynicism comes from recent articles questioning the story of Sierra Leone child soldier Ishmael Beah. But both subjects are preferable to hearing him scold 50 Cent-- or, as his background singers call the Connecticut resident, ""50 Cents."" ""You have done enough damage selling crack cocaine/ Now you got a 'kill a black man' video game,"" he raps. (Earlier in the song he worries, ""You probably hate me."" Um, probably not. It's a safe bet 50 is not going to make a fuss over Jal the way he has over Alicia Keys and Oprah.) Jal isn't much of a rapper. He sometimes talks and sometimes flows, but mostly talks. His style is perhaps comparable to Diddy's, both in its lack of luster and its dependence on memorable beats to buttress the songs. But most of Warchild's production-- done largely by Bahamas-based Roachie, who also co-wrote most of the songs with Jal-- feels watered down. Roachie has diluted the African rhythms with lonely synths, shotgun blasts, and other generica of modern hip-hop. Suffice it to say, Salim is badly missed.","London resident who fled South Sudan releases his second album to coincide with screenings of a new documentary about his life; while some songs deal with the horrors he witnessed as a child solider, others concern culture shock and his struggles in the first world.

I Wish That I Could See You Soon EP,Herman Dune,by: Stephen M.

Featuring some green-screen shots that were all the more charming for being unfinished, it was the perfect mesh of visuals and music: puppets and moppets running around to a modestly arranged, enormously catchy folk-pop ditty complete with horns, angelic back-up singers, and vocalist David-Ivar Herman Dune's direct exhortations to the listener. Sporting a pink furry hoodie over his full beard, he came across like the greatest camp counselor ever, Raffi for twentysomething hipsters-- except, you know, bearable. More than bearable, actually. After about a decade together, Herman Dune-- which consists of Franco-Swedish singer David-Ivar Herman Dune and drummer Neman-- have sharpened their craft without becoming overly professional or disingenuous. On the band's new EP, I Wish That I Could See You Soon, they play deceptively simple folk-based compositions with flashes of electric guitars, horns, mouth harp, and bowed saw. Each song has a similar structure: a few short lines followed by the title phrase capping each stanza. A full album of songs with this structure might grow repetitive, but on this five-track EP, it sounds like a songwriterly signature. If the music sounds upbeat and whimsical, the subject matter very rarely is. David-Ivar writes about the confusions and frustrated yearnings of long-distance relationships, and the fact that the band is based in New York-- thousands of miles from home-- only reinforces the sense of isolation and longing. ""Take Him Back to New York City"" relates the pains of a bi-coastal relationship, as a transplanted West Coaster pines for an East Coast lover and, consequently, for the city they once shared. ""I Wish I Had Someone That I Loved Well"", with its Greek chorus of horns, follows an émigré around Coney Island as he tries half-heartedly to assimilate. On the other hand, the downtempo ""When the Water Gets Cold (And Freezes on the Lake)"" twists the formula slightly, describing lovers separated not only by geography, but by betrayal. ""Right now I need to stay home, and I don't need your company,"" sings David-Ivar. ""Right now I need to be alone, and I need you to stay away from me."" Distance can be therapeutic. As a singer, David-Ivar knows his limitations but refuses to work around or disguise them. Instead, he embraces them, devising an idiosyncratic approach to pop songwriting. Emphasizing his slight range (just four or five notes, it seems), he sings in a loose and talky style, becoming increasingly conversational as he addresses the horns, back-up singers, characters, and even you, the listener. ""And we all go woo woo,"" he declares on ""Take Him Back to New York City"", right before the back-up singers coo the easy-listening bridge. He's not just warning you that the woo woo's are coming up, but also inviting you to sing along. All that's missing is a campfire.","Herman Dune-- which consists of Franco-Swedish singer David-Ivar Herman Dune and drummer Neman-- have sharpened their craft without becoming overly professional or disingenuous.

The Master's Bedroom Is Worth Spending A Night In,Thee Oh Sees,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5fe5e6ef95969322880/1:1/w_160/9694bfd4.jpg,2008-05-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11477-the-masters-bedroom-is-worth-spending-a-night-in/,Tomlab,"No need to get John Dwyer's lawyers on the phone. This is still, for all intents and purposes, the same band that has gone by minutely different handles such as OCS and TheOhsees and The Oh Sees. On the surface, this would seem like (sigh) OCD; jokes about that TV show are pretty much hacks-only at this point, and if Dwyer isn't particularly happy with what we thought of his last album, it's still showing up at the bottom anyway. But on The Master's Bedroom Is Worth Spending a Night In, consider it a flare gun signaling an impending about-face, as the undercooked folk of 2006 release The Cool Death Of Island Raiders is jettisoned for an album of a very particular sort of desert summer, as influenced by oil stains and scorched blacktop every bit as much as gutbucket garage and primordial rock. Master's Bedroom conjures vast stretches of I-10 through the Inland Empire, with an occasional heat-stroke mirage along the way (the true-to-title ""Graveyard Drug Party""). And while this territory conjures wanderlust-induced drives that are often romanticized, in reality, you can go for dozens and dozens of miles without feeling like you've gone anywhere. It's a natural result of Dwyer mostly working in two gears, namely rough & tumble or tough & rumble. Ostensibly, the intent was to create a simulacrum of 1960s Bay Area psychedelics without the marathon solos, and in its own way, Master's Bedroom can be as hypnotic and mesmeric as any drone album. Stephen Merritt might be the only guy relying on fuzz more heavily in 2008, but while Distortion used its namesake to clash with an obvious melodic microstructure, Dwyer's work is more suited for muscle cars and barbecues than headphones. If you don't have access to the credits, you'd have no idea Dave Sitek worked on three of these tracks. Despite splitting between Sitek and A-Frames guy Chris Woodhouse, Master Bedroom manages to be a consistent record, albeit to a fault at some points. Working in a frequency band this narrow is liable to produce slump or two over the span of 15 tracks-- the rubber band melody in ""Block of Ice"" is an instant pleasure, an imagining of what The B-52's might sound like from a passing car. But halfway through the album (particularly on ""Ghost in the Trees"") it feels like we've already heard it three different times in some minor variation and the megaphone effect on Dwyer's vocals doesn't make the lyrics particularly effective milemarkers; this is how the words ""block of ice"" end up sounding more like ""fuck all night."" Yet, all this ""but is it art?"" talk is rendered inappropriate when you consider this record's just so goddamn fun and loosey-goosey that by comparison, the Black Keys sound like Interpol-- tellingly, nearly every single track begins with a count-off, the sound of a guitar plugging in or some in media res feedback. Usually, that's a cheap ploy for a band to feign garage ""authenticity"" while recording in a $500-an-hour studio, but here it feels like the natural entry to songs that have Thee Oh Sees getting their hands muddy and surprising themselves when they strike oil; listen to how the Nuggets-style title track unexpectedly powerlifts its hook, and it's difficult to hear it any other way.","Here the undercooked folk of the band's 2006 release The Cool Death Of Island Raiders is jettisoned for an album of a very particular sort of desert summer, as influenced by oil stains and scorched blacktop every bit as much as gutbucket garage and primordial rock.

Ringer,Four Tet,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b61dea9e61561daa6eec/1:1/w_160/45a2d649.jpg,2008-05-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11505-ringer/,Domino,"As Four Tet, Kieran Hebden has been a chameleonic interpreter of genres. Using a cut-up and collage approach, he's bent folk music, jazz, and hip-hop into impossible shapes; each time we seem to draw a bead on his style, whether it's folktronica, instrumental hip-hop, or IDM, Hebden neatly steps out of the crosshairs to leave us firing at thin air. In fact, his music is best understood according to practice. From the folky samples of Pause to the laptop bobbins of Rounds to the free-jazzy squalls of his collaborations with drummer Steve Reid, Hebden has seemed less interested in developing genres than in absorbing their tropes into his own hermetic sound world. What distinguishes Four Tet's albums isn't so much the kind of music he appropriates as how he uses it, and in this he's been fairly consistent: He snips and smears until his sources all but vanish into his crisp polyrhythms. On his superlative album Rounds, Hebden's music did indeed seem round: It moved in great languid whorls, always closing in on itself. The song ""Spirit Fingers"", which fluttered and darted like a hummingbird, was an exception. In retrospect, ""Spirit Fingers"" seems to presage the four-song ""mini-album"" Ringer, which is as well-served by its title as Rounds was. Here, Hebden can no longer be meaningfully compared to Prefuse 73, as the album's dialed-down cut-ups and continuous rhythms render it too smoove for IDM. At four songs, Ringer is economical, but the diversity within its half-hour run time makes it surprisingly robust as well. This is meant to be Hebden's techno-based album, with flashes of Afrobeat and krautrock. You'll catch whiffs of the former in the sidewinding percussion of ""Wing Body Wing"", and of the latter in the buried pulsation of ""Swimmer"" (not to mention 8-bit techno in the pixelated sprays of the title track). But as always, Hebden's latest is most interesting at the level of theme-- Ringer is about concealment and revelation, and it gains a great deal of tension in its quick juxtapositions of the two. There is something tantalizing about these four tracks, which, at times, seems to verge on the lascivious. The title track thrums for ten hotwired minutes, but there's a sense of something being held back; the loping house beat it implies never actually appears. One of its sub-melodies comes into view measure by measure, showing a little more of its progression each time, like a hem creeping slowly up a thigh. This isn't the Four Tet who shoves shunts into his rhythms; ""Ringer"" unfolds with inexorable logic. But it's a logic parallel to the one we might normally expect, which exhorts a track like this to eventually break into a climactic clearing. If ""Ringer"" flirts with the thwarted epiphany, then ""Ribbons"" (by my reckoning, the album's highlight) makes up for the tease by enacting the moment of revelation over and over, rooting itself in the ecstatic experience. Hebden punches trills into the seething percussion at various speeds and durations, sometimes slow and wet, sometimes quick and ringing; sometimes discretely separated, sometimes truncated and overlapped. It's the sound of a series of beaded curtains being thrown back, divulging more curtains: all revelation, nothing revealed. After the flirtatious ""Ribbons"", Hebden pulls back coyly with the hypnotic ""Swimmer"": A wavering monotone surrounds it, exposing bits of gargling synths and holding back any sort of release until the halfway point, when the percussion suddenly snakes through the monotone like ivy. The closing track, ""Wing Body Wing"", is slightly less interesting than the others; its emphasis on bare-naked percussion makes it sound like half of a Sound of Silver-era LCD Soundsystem track. The rhythms are adroit, but seem to long for something more. Nevertheless, ""Wing Body Wing"" is the only time when the album's strategic omissions dilute its impact rather than bolstering it.","Latest from Kieran Hebden is a mini-album that leans toward 4/4 techno, but, as usual, he seems less interested in developing genres than in absorbing their tropes into his own hermetic sound world.

The Slip,Nine Inch Nails,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b61bea9e61561daa6ee9/1:1/w_160/2c102a53.jpg,2008-05-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11503-the-slip/,self-released,"Remember how frustrating it was when Nine Inch Nails would make us wait four to six years between albums? That trend, it appears, has entered the rearview mirror stage, along with the label messes and rehab stints that helped cause those interminable gaps. Consider the new math after The Slip hit hard drives as a free download last Monday: over the last three years, Trent Reznor's released as many full-length records of new material (four) as he did during the first decade of his recorded existence. Since Pretty Hate Machine, the concept behind Reznor's work with Nine Inch Nails has been blunt and straightforward: dystopian techno-metal forged from the fusion of man and machine. But since last year's Year Zero, which came bundled with an alternate-reality video game and high-concept pre-release marketing schedule, and including Ghosts I-IV, which mimicked Radiohead's lossy-leader gimmick, Reznor has slowly emerged as a new sort of cyborg: an artist wholly immersed in the newest digital trends for the distribution and promotion of his music. Like a more magnanimous Radiohead, Reznor's called into question the major-label reserve clause for established, profitable musicians by not just coming up with a new way to monetize music, but just giving it away for free, no strings attached. Instead of ""tip-jar,"" it's ""this one's on me."" Unlike its most immediate predecessors, The Slip comes packaged with a crucial difference: the music itself is more satisfying than the sui generis marketing scheme. Reznor's unique capacity to commingle raging industrial bangers with ballads and ambient instrumental passages appears in its best form since The Downward Spiral, and here gains much of the focus and restraint that many remember used to be his calling card. At just under 44 minutes, The Slip is Reznor's shortest full-length since Machine, and it indexes many of his most appealing qualities as a songwriter and album sequencer. His former label Interscope still retains the rights to issue a Nine Inch Nails greatest-hits set, but The Slip plays like Reznor's own minor retrospective, fleshed out with plenty of present-day ruminations. First single ""Discipline"" eschews a typically monstrous chorus for an airtight industrial disco grind ventilated by an airy piano and falsetto cooing. It's another solid pop song about constraint from the guy who, following Prince, brought kinky sex odes to strip-mall bars. This sort of control is of a different stripe than in the past, though: When Reznor asks, ""Is my viciousness losing ground?"", it comes from a long-established and now label-free artist trying to reflexively reassert his position in the pop landscape, on his own terms. One of the pitfalls of perfectionism and digital production is endless tinkering and shapeless experimentation, and ""Discipline"" evinces Reznor's desire for some sort of framework, lest he get too comfortable cranking out 4-LP instrumental opuses from here on out. In relative terms, ""I need your discipline/ I need your help"" is sure a long way from the nearly 20-year-old ""Head Like a Hole"" refrain ""I'd rather die/ Than give you control"". Studio hermeticism is still isolation, though, and ""Discipline"" gives way to ""Echoplex"", in which Reznor's attention is taken by the sound of his voice reverberating throughout the studio. After a quick swipe at those who've insisted he's passed his sell-by date: ""I'm safe in here/ Irrelevant/ Just like they said,"" he casts his tomb as a seductive, slow-torture chamber, cooing: ""My voice just echoes off these walls."" ""1,000,000""-- with any luck, the album's second single-- reappropriates the ""Hurt"" lyric ""a million miles away"" from the context of heroin addiction isolation to a more recent sort of reality-remove, occasioned by a period of declining fortunes for major labels. This sort of self-referentiality seems designed to clarify that Reznor has moved from a self-destructive form of addiction to another, hopefully more productive one. While I doubt The Slip recording process resembled this (although that would be awesome), the liner notes do hint toward a possible shift in method. Session drummer Josh Freese is accompanied by longtime associate Robin Finck (back after a profoundly unproductive period as Slash's replacement in Guns 'n Roses), and keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, and all are listed in the credits as co-performers. I have no idea how much trap-work Freese does on the album itself, but the mixture of live and machined drumming is The Slip's most appealing sonic quality. It's not a totally new thing, of course-- Dave Grohl played on much of With Teeth-- but here, Reznor strives specifically for, and occasionally hits, the sort of room-mic'd aura that made a song like ""March of the Pigs"" such a visceral experience. The riff-metal on ""Discipline"", ""1,000,000"", ""Head Down"", and ""Demon Seed"" can't compete with the best of the 1989-94 era, but it's clear that Reznor's assessing the best of his peak period through the filter of his post-Fragile activity, and producing some solid songs in the process. The hard-hitting first half of The Slip gives way to a second marked by a more patient form of rumination, beginning with the plangent ""Lights in the Sky"", on which Reznor unearths the decaying piano from the Tate Mansion for a song that, like Radiohead's ""Weird Fishes"", finds macabre, romantic pleasure in drowning. ""Lights"" seamlessly blends into the seven-and-a-half minute ambient piece ""Corona Radiata"", which ascends to a noise-filled post-rock crescendo before abruptly cutting to the evocatively-titled ""The Four of Us Are Dying"". Reznor's fondness for instrumental passages on his albums goes back to Broken, but this 12-minute stretch, more than a quarter of The Slip's runtime and the obvious product of post-Ghost compositional confidence, is the only lag in the album's overall flow. It's much easier to listen to these pieces in the context of a traditional Nine Inch Nails album, to be sure, but the pulsing rhythm of ""Dying"" is nonetheless welcome after ""Corona"", a lengthy indulgence not quite earned. The title of ""Dying"" is a nerdy reference from Reznor to this Twilight Zone"" episode, in which Archie Hammer, a low-life mug, possesses the ability to change his face at will and assume the personalities of the recently deceased. The title is its own spoiler, really, but the episode is more than just an ending; it's a 24-minute meditation on the public performance of identity, and the frightening ramifications that can happen when none of them have any bearing in reality. It's the sort of lesson that Reznor seems to be learning publicly, and occasionally painfully. The Slip, then, allows him to do just that: shift between and reflect upon his various artistic and personal personae, without fear of reprisal. Instead of a symbolic death, The Slip feels much more like a possible rebirth.","Trent Reznor returns with yet another digital record; The Slip is a free download that, unlike the sprawling loss-leader Ghosts I-IV, consists of fully realized songs. Pretty good ones, too.

Freedom Wind,The Explorers Club,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6079d034d5c69bf5115/1:1/w_160/effafd70.jpg,2008-05-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11485-freedom-wind/,Dead Oceans,"""THEY'VE FOUND THE NEW SOUND AT LAST!"" shrieked the headline over a London Sunday Express review as ""Good Vibrations"" hit the English charts at #6 and leaped to #1 the following week. Bright, cheery, bouncy, shiny: pretty much the true sound of Los Angeles, in 1966. A critic or two might've groused that groups like the Beach Boys and the Beatles were drowning out real American rock'n'roll-- who would squander their good American gin-and-glue buying power to consume this surfer-limey drivel?-- but a gazillion years later, it's pretty clear which old farts won that battle. For confirmation, look no further than the six young men of the Explorers Club, who in 2008 have created nothing less than a full-fledged teenage symphony to Brian Wilson. More than a decade after the likes of the High Llamas and the Elephant 6 groups helped revive interest in the Beach Boys' psychedelic period, and only a year after Panda Bear's Wilson-tripping Person Pitch, the Explorers Club have refreshingly more innocent ideas. The Charleston, S.C. band's full-length debut, Freedom Wind, like their self-released The Explorers Club EP before it, takes inspiration from the Beach Boys' songs about girls and fun in the sun, from the years before and after their Chuck Berry-style rock'n'roll was replaced by sounds that were more complex and disturbing-- Holland as much as Today!, with some of Friends' low-key charm. Hell, from their Spector-lush production to their layered vocal harmonies, and even into some specifics of their compositional structures, songs like the EP's ""Don't Forget the Sun"" or singles ""Last Kiss"" and ""Do You Love Me?"" could almost be mistaken for lost Beach Boys sides. What could come as higher praise? Freedom Wind includes three of the four songs on the Explorers Club's original EP, and it partly fulfills that record's promise. Especially if you like the Beach Boys. They've even got the studio banter, like at the start of ""Lost My Head"", in which high, swirling vocals rise over organs and tremolo guitar; the repeated ""my friend"" is also reminiscent of r&b group Shai's a cappella 1992 hit, ""If I Ever Fall in Love"" (a personal favorite). Opener ""Forever"" starts off, appropriately enough, like ""Be My Baby"", and it has a guitar solo that uses the fundamental idea of the Beach Boys' rudimentary ""Don't Worry Baby"" solo. Elsewhere, the Explorers Club show they can do something other than slavish recreations of familiar Beach Boys sounds, on ""Honey I Don't Know Why"", although the song's raspy vocals unfortunately make for the album's most jarring track. Name me one 1960s superstar who hasn't become a zombie-- revivified like the Beatles as Oasis, Hendrix as Kravitz, or all those new Dylans (Lou Reed was once a professional zombie). The Explorers Club deserve more credit for so masterfully distilling a beloved style that other bands of their age group have long ignored, just as the Pipettes or El Perro Del Mar can't be faulted for looking to their own, similar '60s pop niches for inspiration. But where Pet Sounds gives a highly personal, resonant look at love and its place in a young man's life, Freedom Wind is full of anachronisms, even down to ""been steady"" on the still-lovely ""Last Kiss"". Why would a band with the clear arranging and compositional chops of the Explorers Club settle for being, at best, your second-favorite group? And, if I were (and remember, this is a hypothetical, haha) to expertly copy my favorite bits of Beach Boys-related rockcrit by Jules Siegel, Nick Tosches, Greil Marcus, Lester Bangs, Jim DeRogatis, and Jim Fusilli-- following their every footstep and participating in burning out with their once-brilliant movement, as Vlaminck, Derain, Van Dongen, and others participated in the brilliant flash that was Fauvism at the turn of the 20th century-- and still not quite make them my own, well, then what would Richard Meltzer say about Jan and Dean?","More than a decade after the likes of the High Llamas and the Elephant 6 groups helped revive interest in the Beach Boys' psychedelic period, and only a year after Panda Bear's Wilson-tripping Person Pitch, the Explorers Club celebrate the band's sun-soaked early singles.

Sexuality,Sébastien Tellier,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5e013d197565213ad32/1:1/w_160/ec5c5620.jpg,2008-05-12 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11447-sexuality/,Record MakersLucky Number,"Sébastien Tellier shares little sonically with fellow French shapeshifter Serge Gainsbourg, but he has adopted some of the man's most endearing sensibilities, namely, an embrace of artifice and a willingness to genre-hop well beyond his expected limitations. Gainsbourg made worthwhile reggae and art rock records chiefly because he approached each style fearlessly, unaware or uncaring of how these records would look amongst the rest of his work; Tellier stepped well outside his comfort zone-- and not necessarily successfully-- on 2004's world music experiment Politics before shifting to groovy (literally) soundtrack work on 2006's Sessions. Sexuality, his fourth album, moves toward erotic synth-pop in what might be a more stereotypically French pursuit, but Tellier's willingness to engage the material without contempt or parody leads to an album of unexpected charm and grace. That grace is key, too: Sexuality's goofball cover invites comparisons to another Frenchman with sex on the brain-- Pepé Le Pew-- but the album's artwork is its only obvious ham, Tellier wisely choosing to bypass smoove in favor of smooth. Moon Safari, by former touring partners (and label heads) Air, might seem like an obvious touchstone, but Sexuality, produced by Daft Punk's Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, is far more kinetic, laying metronomic sequencers over patient chord changes. Tellier moves easily between English and French and his surprisingly accomplished husk keeps lyrics largely indecipherable; camp and humor are by no means absent-- please see the female moans that effectively constitute the chorus of ""Pomme""-- but they're a smaller piece of the pie than expected, considering the cover features a man riding a donkey on a naked woman's torso. Nothing on Sexuality is as stormily danceable as non-album single ""Sexual Sportswear"" but Tellier does favor tiny pipe-cleaner rhythms in his pop: ""Kilometer"" surfs around in-the-red synthesizer stabs; a flanged, bending guitar riff sets the stage for the urban lounge of ""Une Heure""; ""Manty"" draws a pulse from a woman's sampled syllabic ""huh hah""'s. ""Look"" best encapsulates Sexuality's sporty hook-making: slow changes, percussive synths, Tellier cooing over the top. You'll nod the tune right out of your head before the next track begins. That is, of course, Sexuality's greatest weakness. Tellier's talents and interests are manifold; he is, perhaps necessarily, a moodmaker rather than a songsmith. Sexuality's stylistic choices offer him plenty of leeway, allowing him to sneak forgettable hooks by with precise atmosphere and committed style. Sexuality is-- forgive the pun-- a labor of love; how else to explain the ""L'Amour et La Violence"", the album's multifarious coda? Mournful electric piano cedes Tellier's plaintive voice cedes spidery electronica; Tellier is a gorger, feeding on many interests and trying to cater to them all. Indulge and enjoy both his shortcomings and his triumphs; he is unlikely to return to them.","Willing to embrace artifice and genre-hop well beyond his expected limitations, this French producer returns with an erotic synth-pop album of unexpected charm and grace.

Going Places: The August Darnell Years 1976-1983,Kid Creole,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5bf13d197565213acf4/1:1/w_160/705ed639.jpg,2008-05-12 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11418-going-places-the-august-darnell-years-1976-1983/,Strut,"""Like the Seminole, Navajo, Kickapoo/ Like those Indians, I'm an Indian too."" These are words you will find rolling around your mind, for reasons all out of sorts, after listening to the maniacally infectious disco of August Darnell. (Prepare, too, to take stock of the Chippewa, Iroquois, Omaha, and Sioux, lest other tribes go underrepresented.) The couplet comes from ""I'm an Indian Too"" by Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band, one of many acts commanded by Darnell during an era when disco knew no bounds. It certainly didn't on any of the tracks compiled on Going Places: The August Darnell Years 1976-1983, a collection of stuttering, stately, and studiously weird disco songs that have to be heard to be believed. Darnell was involved in Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band before branching out as a writer/producer for other acts (many on the fabled crypto-disco label Ze Records) and then for his own group Kid Creole & the Coconuts. Common to them all are theatrical airs, irrepressible grooves, and fateful moments, however subtle or pronounced, that give rise to reactions classifiable only as WTF?!?! The new compilation starts with Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band's ""Sunshower"", a spritzy song that has become ubiquitous thanks to samples by Ghostface and M.I.A., among others. From there, Going Places goes places where idiosyncrasy and ambition reign. The title track, by Kid Creole & the Coconuts, struts through a funky mix of rhythm guitar and dryly shaken cymbals before breaking for a vibraphone solo and an eerie few-note guitar refrain that plays like something out of Blue Öyster Cult's ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"". In ""Is That All There Is?"", singer Cristina broods about nightlife boredom with coy high-style jadedness before assenting to ""let's keep dancing"" (and this in the midst of a musique concrète interlude complete with cuckoo clock and restless crowd sounds). Some of the songs on Going Places were made for dance-theater projects in the East Village in the 1980s, but one gets the sense that, for Darnell, a blank reel of tape was as conducive to theatricality as any commissioned stage. The parade of vocalists on display-- snappy divas, choruses of kids, uncertain guys who sound like they were just pulled away from sweeping up the studio-- makes for an uncommonly wide range of expression. And the music follows suit. The disco-vocal histrionics in Machine's ""There But for the Grace of God Go I"", so intense you can practically see the veins rising on the singers' foreheads, sound calm compared to a synth-streaked instrumental breakdown with sweaty funk guitars and blitzing bass runs too controlled to worry over mere concerns of the humanly realm. A similar mood plays out in slow songs like Aural Exciters' ""Emile (Night Rate)"", which cycles through a carnival of ideas without rising above a simmer. The most striking aspect of Going Places is how little a sense of novelty figures into songs so outrageously playful and weird. The bizarre parts are never bizarre for no reason, and they're played (often by many, many band members) with too much spirit and skill to rate as stunts. It's hard to imagine dance music half as grand and imaginative being made today. But then, August Darnell would be hard to account for in any era.","A collection of stuttering, stately, and studiously weird disco songs associated with producer/writer/performer August Darnell.

Momofuku,Elvis Costello,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b606ea9e61561daa6ece/1:1/w_160/730c38eb.jpg,2008-05-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11484-momofuku/,Lost Highway,"Elvis Costello's career has taken so many left turns since his new-wave beginnings that it's nearly more surprising to hear him record a rock record these days than one of his many excursions in other genres. But Momofuku returns him to his band the Imposters-- their first in a while, and likely the sort of record most of his fans have been waiting for. Fortunately, it's the best of all that would imply: a fiercely melodic record that sinks or swims on the dynamics of his band, much in the vein of his relative comeback album When I Was Cruel and at times even Blood and Chocolate. The songs are raw and unfussy, and they show off what must come naturally to Costello: tracks stitched together from several disparate and equally unforgettable hooks, and lyrics filled with deft wordplay and plenty of seething and unsatisfied characters. Most of all the record's songs are wrested from guitar and organ, whether it's the irrepressible pop of ""American Gangster Time"", the hushed, percussive groove of ""Drum and Bone"", or the distorted stomp of ""Stella Hurt"". Extra flourishes are kept to a minimum, with the exception of copious amounts of backing vocals. Costello fears no overdub on ""American Gangster Time"" or ""Pardon Me Madam, My Name is Eve"", while he gets help from a vocal ""supergroup"" bolstered by Jenny Lewis and several others on many of the record's tracks, be their contributions manically layered on ""Drum and Bone"" or just subtle coloring from Lewis on ""Song With Rose"". From the album's opener, Costello is already aiming at critics in ""No Hiding Place"" who have grown more anonymous as his career has gone on (while taking note of ""The very near future/ When everything will be free""), has no kind words for corruption across the pond in ""American Gangster Time"" (""It's a drag saluting that starry rag""), and finds even finds strife in, depending on your beliefs, the world's first coupling (""Pardon Me Madam, My Name Is Eve""). Yet while Costello is known for his pith, there's a certain amount of gentleness and grown-ass-man maturity present elsewhere: The honking jazz guitar of ""Harry Worth"" almost mocks Costello's previous ballroom pretensions, while the lyrics are like an answer to embittered earlier songs like ""Almost Blue"" or ""The Long Honeymoon"" as the narrator seeks to bring together dueling newlyweds, assuring them, ""it's not very far between tears and mirth."" Later, the placid ballad ""My Three Sons"" is a hopeful ode to estranged parents and finds glimmers of acceptance in growing old. Even a meat-and-potatoes rock record from Costello would be nothing to complain about, but Momofuku finds small, but significant ways to diversify. Aside from the welcome downshift of ""Harry Worth"", there's a distinctive country twang (no stranger to his catalog) behind the prideful grand piano banging in ""Song for Rose"", while ""Mr. Feathers"" walks the middle ground between woozy Beatlesque melodies and the trashcan symphonies of Tom Waits. There's some percussive feats of wonder as well, from the chaotic clatter that closes out ""Stella Hurt"" to some of the man/machine editing that marked the material from When I Was Cruel on ""Turpentine"", one of two songs where the Imposters swelled to nine musicians, including Pete Thomas' daughter Tennessee from the Like on additional drums. It's a remarkably consistent album, but what unifies these songs is how they were recorded, and how Costello and company play to their particular strengths. Even with all these extra musicians-- all valuable players who acquit themselves beautifully, of course-- it goes to show that Costello's songwriting voice is indelible, no matter who is or how many people are playing. While his omnivorous ears and musical appetite should be lauded, perhaps this is why records like these feel like more natural contexts for him. It lacks any standout single to rally around or champion, but maybe it's better that Momofuku's no-nonsense mood is unbroken. It's the longtime fans who'll be happiest with Momofuku, as the traditional four-piece ""American Gangster Time"" and closing track ""Go Away"", with its harsh vocal echo and buzzing organ, might be as close to vintage Costello as we may ever hear again.","Elvis Costello releases his first Imposters album in a while, and it's the best of all that would imply-- a fiercely melodic record that sinks or swims on the dynamics of his band.

Narrow Stairs,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b619ea9e61561daa6ee6/1:1/w_160/6db00be8.jpg,2008-05-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11501-narrow-stairs/,Atlantic,"Love isn't watching someone die, contrary to what Ben Gibbard memorably sang on Death Cab for Cutie's major-label debut. No, love is watching someone grow and change and still staying with them-- whether we're talking about family, friends, romantic interests, or a little college-town indie rock band from about an hour-and-a-half outside Seattle. Death is just the dénouement. In the three years since their platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated Plans, Gibbard and Death Cab producer/guitarist Chris Walla have both entered their thirties, coming off a wave of successes that included 2003's Transatlanticism going gold and the debut by Gibbard side project the Postal Service becoming Sub Pop's best-selling disc since Nirvana. That's a whole lotta love. Narrow Stairs, Death Cab's second album for Atlantic and sixth proper LP overall, is one of the darkest and most muscular in the band's discography, but they're still aiming for the same place: your heart. It's an album about growing and changing and becoming resigned to the fact that you'll never be truly content-- not even if you quit that day job, achieve your rock'n'roll dreams, and find yourself in a loving marriage. At times, the maturation feels forced; the more adventurous moments here are experimental only for such a high-profile group, and they don't play to Gibbard's sentimental, word-weighing strengths. Still, even the disappointingly sleepy Plans had ear-catching singles, and when Death Cab go with their pop instincts on Narrow Stairs, they bang out songs focused and evocative enough to win over maybe a few of this loved-and-hated group's longtime skeptics. There are some vast expanses to navigate first, both production-wise and lyrically. Where Transatlanticism spanned an ocean, and Plans opened astride ""the East River and Hudson,"" Narrow Stairs starts along the California coast, where Gibbard retreated to write the album. ""I descended a dusty gravel ridge,"" his bookish tenor begins, in clear but vivid language, on ""Bixby Canyon Bridge"". Gibbard has said the song is about trying to commune with Jack Kerouac, who stayed in the same cabin to write Big Sur. From an initial echoey guitar trill, the track grows to pounding, distorted bombast somewhere between OK Computer and the new Coldplay single. Speaking of singles, Narrow Stairs' first is the eight-and-a-half minute ""I Will Possess Your Heart"", a decision that's likely to be more successful as brand repositioning than it is as rock music. Death Cab get uncompromising-artist points for the four-minute intro that builds up with vamping bass, sprinkles of keyboard, and atmospheric guitar, but it's hardly essential to the standard-length pop song that follows, about how a well-intentioned man can turn into a de facto creepy stalker. ""You gotta spend some time, love,"" Gibbard sings, as if by explanation for the song's length. On Narrow Stairs, Death Cab move from the undergraduate longing of their earlier work and the looming mortality of Plans to a more generalized existential angst. But they're most successful when they don't switch up their style to match; the sound of settling, as Transatlanticism maintained, is a peppy ""ba ba,"" not the krautrock pulse of this album's synth-touched remainder metaphor, ""Long Division"". Elsewhere, the tabla on ""Pity and Fear"" sounds out of place, not far-out; as Indian-instrumented songs about an apparent adulterous one-night stand go, this one's no ""Norwegian Wood"". ""No Sunlight"" cuts through the murk like a beam of, well, sunlight-- musically, at least. Bright keyboards and guitars sweeten Gibbard's pessimistic lyrics, which contrast childhood bliss with the emptiness of adulthood. The best song on the album, ""Cath..."", matches the knotty, Built to Spill-style riffs of Death Cab's early records with a plainspoken (and gut-wrenching) account of a bride who dooms herself to misery by marrying the wrong man. Where fools rush in, Gibbard refuses to rush to judgment: ""I'd have done the same as you,"" he concludes. What Death Cab have to fear most is not their urge to dabble in different genres, but the risk of sounding like a more cloying version of their younger selves. On ""You Can Do Better Than Me"", which waltzes its 1960s-pop organs way past the line that Ben Folds' ""The Luckiest"" toed like a ballerina, Gibbard's nice-guy earnestness becomes too much even for a listener who relates to nice-guy earnestness. It's easy to tell where the heavy-handed ""Your New Twin Sized Bed"" and ""The Ice Is Getting Thinner"" are headed as soon as you hear their first lines, and thin ice is a pretty thin cliché for such a lyric-focused group. ""Grapevine Fires"" does better, adding funereal harmonies and recalling debut LP Something About Airplanes with a line about ""wine and some paper cups."" Surely Death Cab's awkward position as one of the few indie rock groups with a platinum record would be enough to drive anyone to drink. Fellow million-sellers Modest Mouse brought on Johnny Marr for their latest major-label LP; the Decemberists, who also signed to a major but didn't go platinum, have yet to release their follow-up. Narrow Stairs' musical growing pains make sense for an album that stares into the banal void of contemporary adulthood. If you love the band, you'll probably find enough reasons here to keep sticking with them.","Death Cab's second album for Atlantic and sixth proper LP overall is one of the darkest and most muscular in the band's discography, as they move from the undergraduate longing of their earlier work and the looming mortality of Plans to a more generalized existential angst.

They were kind of dilapidated and sloppy, but I liked them for it, and not just because they didn't sound like the same nu-metal or half-assed Lookout! punk or cheap Sunny Day Real Estate knockoff crap I usually reviewed. I got this great lo-fi psych vibe out of them that proved to be hard to define, exactly, except in terms of atmosphere: sort of logey, kind of humid, with a great deal of heavy, clanky fuckaroundery. Over the next few years I found some low-key joy in their 2004 cassette-only release Yes, then more or less lost track of them despite their relatively high-profile signing to Capitol and the release of their 2006 major label debut Movie Monster. Maybe I should've paid a bit more attention before they broke up: any band that responds to a Pitchfork pan with a video attempting to depict Marc Hogan's thumbs-down in the most literal terms possible has to have something going for 'em somewhere. After founder and multi-instrumentalist Bill Baird went from the defunct Sound Team to his own project as {{{Sunset}}}, the PR guy for Autobus offered to send me a few CDs of his, as well as a cassette. After accepting the CDs but mentioning that I didn't actually have a working cassette player anymore, they actually spent $12 on postage to send me a beat-up tape deck. All that weirdly-guided effort and oddball behavior really makes me wish I liked this CD a lot more than I do. Considering that the two Bill Baird solo/proto-{{{Sunset}}} CDs I got in that tape deck package held a lot of promise-- they were unrepentantly strange and darkly funny in a way that reminded me of Beck if Mellow Gold tanked and he never met the Dust Brothers, deciding instead to keep going on the Stereopathetic Soulmanure path-- Bright Blue Dream is surprisingly short on ideas, even if the atmosphere almost makes up for it. The compromise between lo-fi aesthetics and Spiritualized-level grandiosity works fairly well, and the album's first half is workable enough as a mixed bag of shoegaze-pop fundamentals. While ""I Love My Job"" is a speedbump-- the first-draft Spoon piano and obvious office-woe lyrics make it catchy but not much else-- the eerie chiming whirr of opener ""Dear Broken Friend"" and the evocative new wave/synth-psych ""Diamond Studded Caskets"" are legitimately beautiful in a disconnected and ill-fitting sort of way. Even if it comes too close to a polished, hypnotic tautness for the sloppy edges to be excusable, the sound on Bright Blue Dream has some appeal when driving percussive compositions are run through it. It's the ambient, overlong second half that drags things down. The simple structure of ""Moebius"" vaguely works because capping off its leaning-on-a-synth hum with a crescendo of keening guitar is pretty much the only logical way to end a song like that on an album like this, but ""Golden Reverie""-- a drum-free, piano-driven melodic piece augmented by mysterious effects pedal/worn-out Mellotron debris-- is three minutes' worth of prettiness stretched out to five and a half minutes' worth of repetition. The downpitched, dying-battery banjo-and-handclap bluegrass of ""Old Sandy Bull Lee"" is evocatively ramshackle, but the two-minute whining keyboard coda sounds less like an ascent into some higher plane of freak-folk and more like things just petering out. And the endless drone of ""Bright Blue Dream"" is Eno without a point: when listening to the 14-plus-minute title cut leaves me with the same impression as a seven-second transitional track, something ain't right. Like the (apparently optional) curly brackets around Sunset's name, the bloat around this album makes a perfectly accessible core into a bewildering mess-- even if, more often than not, it's also a compelling mess.","New psych-oriented project from multi-instrumentalist Bill Baird, formerly of Sound Team, is bewildering and messy but often compelling.

The Latest Rights,The Strugglers,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c3ea9e61561daa6e6b/1:1/w_160/36dd14a7.jpg,2008-05-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11421-the-latest-rights/,Acuarela,"The closing track on the Strugglers' The Latest Rights is called ""My Slow Reflection"", and it's a title that's pretty damn emblematic of leader Randy Bickford's artistic mission as a whole. His entire aim here amounts to a deliberate examination both of clear, concrete moments and diffuse philosophical states, each impression turned over and parsed with exquisite care. The ruminative, metaphysical bent of North Carolina-based Bickford's alt-countryish musings is only emphasized by his cracked, weary voice (invariably likened to Will Oldham's, though being deeper, Bickford's instrument is often closer to Eddie Vedder's), slow-shuffling musical accompaniment, and long lyrical lines. Bickford is fond of tracing a single thought or sketching a single image throughout the winding course of several bars, building suspense and making you wait patiently for the pay-off, which typically feels like a reward even when it's something as relatively banal as ""So when are you going to turn yourself in one direction"". Still, there's a pregnant pause between ""in"" and ""one"" which, when bridged, finds the sense of the phrase dramatically changed. The title track in particular is like a drawing made without once lifting the pen, its gradual coalescing perfectly mirrored in the lyrics' theme of youthful self-discovery. At times, Bickford's concerns are even more archetypal, like the elliptical but weighty considerations of beauty, mythology, and innocence that make up ""Jonathan"" (paradoxically the album's sprightliest and crunchiest rock offering). But it's not all vagary-- the aforementioned ""My Slow Reflection"" includes a line, ""I was spurred always by the points in my life,"" that encapsulates Bickford's frequent willingness to interrupt his allusive sifting and bring out a single tangible image or fact for equivalent inspection. He does have an eye for lyrical detail, whether it's a picture of being ""right in the sunlight with my eyes closed"" on the war-themed ""Redeployment"", or the memory of ""what you said when Donna's baby was born"" in ""New Form"", which leads in short time to a more characteristically nebulous meditation on aging and the creation of identity. Musically, The Latest Rights is occasionally distinguished by stately strings (""Morningside Heights"", ""Limerence"") but more reliably ranges from forgettable unobtrusiveness to pleasantly self-regulating disinterest. Bickford often seems impervious to the musical shifts that go on behind him, but it only helps add to the record's sense of unheeded meandering and organic self-realization. ""I'm soaking in your various shades,"" Bickford wearily attests on the moody, horn-graced ""Theme for the Bad Angels"", and it's a state to which we as listeners can relate in immersing ourselves in his subtle, ever-blurring emotional modulations. The opposite of histrionic, Bickford offers a subdued palette rich in the fineness of its distinctions.","The ruminative, metaphysical bent of North Carolina-based Randy Bickford's alt-countryish musings is only emphasized by his cracked, weary voice, slow-shuffling musical accompaniment, and long lyrical lines.

Vainajan Muotokuva,Eleanoora Rosenholm,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b56ac0084474cd0c2403/1:1/w_160/84fcae77.jpg,2008-05-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11341-vainajan-muotokuva/,Fonal,"Think you might've had Fonal's M.O. figured by now, didja? Fractal, often improvised electro-acoustic noise; shades of spirituality; collectives and excitable art-children. The Finnish label's new project, Eleanoora Rosenholm, shatters all of those preconceptions save the final one, as a trio of veterans and a handful of friends convene (even when taking a singular name and writing bizarre first-person Dear John letters, Finnish artists travel in packs) to craft an art-disco rollercoaster that defies much of the rest of the label's catalogue. Vainajan Muotokuva opens with the attention-grabbing ""Musta Ruusu"", which immediately springs the album's unexpected list of touchstones: ABBA, Madonna, Kylie Minogue. Disco influences also abound and they are ""Italo-"" in as much as they are born from polished, attentive programming and not, say, funk or rock'n'roll. There is a tendency to mentally smooth over albums sung in foreign languages-- Noora Tommila's unfamiliar syllables, however clearly they are articulated, seem to come unlodged from her throat in indefinable clumps-- but it doesn't take long for Vainajan Muotokuva varied stylistic conceits to reveal themselves. The rumbling bassline and slyly rhythmic chimes of ""Kopiokissa"" seemingly snuck out of Massive Attack's sequencers. The frantic kit-work and ""bum bum buh buh""'s of ""Kodinrakennusohjeet"" expose krautrock roots. ""Japanilainen Puutarha"", which contorts around a click-clacking snare, monosyllabic guitar line, and woozy synths, is almost Timbalandian in the way its busyness rises from an economic arrangement. There's also ""Pyhäpietarinaukio"", which spends two minutes on an ambient think-piece more akin to Fonal's natural order, but its dark serenity explodes into ""Kiltti Vai Tuhma"", the most blatantly pop-baiting track on Vainajan Muotokuva (possibly in the Fonal universe). Burly closer ""Maailmanloppu"" steals the Transylvania-ian bells from the Smashing Pumpkins ""Disarm"" and rolls them into a jerky, stepping bassline, paving the way for a choir-like group chorus that stands as the most ostentatious moment on an album full of idiosyncrasies. Despite the bands and styles cited above, Vainajan Muotokuva is only nominally a dance or disco album. At their most propulsive, during ""Maailmanloppu"", Eleanoora aren't going to move a lot of sneakers. Vainajan Muotokuva is a headspace tempest, but one that is distinctly foreign. Even as repeated listens uncover familiar modes and styles, Tommila's melodies remain windily Scandinavian. Any familiarity or placidity brought about by the influences in play here is frequently and probably intentionally interrupted by jarring, ill-fitted sound effects. Still, it is comforting to pronounce the album titles phonetically and to hear them repeated during the song-- as on ""Musta Ruusu""-- because it reassures your brain that these are the type of songs-- pop songs-- in which the title is used as a refrain. Vainajan Muotokuva, even when playing genre hopscotch, never feels like the work of a collective, but rather that of a vocalist and a particularly astute programmer, à la Giorgio Moroder or Maurice Fulton. These slight subversions of precedent help to define an otherwise slippery album: salty Euro-pop, shiftless disco, communal focus. Vainajan Muotokuva stands as an outlier for Fonal musically but it rather perfectly embodies the label's spirit of exploration.","From Finland's Fonal, a label typically known for abstract electro-acoustic and improv, comes a trio offering an art-disco rollercoaster.

Sunday at Devil Dirt,Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6095e6ef95969322891/1:1/w_160/7de78d43.jpg,2008-05-09 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11487-sunday-at-devil-dirt/,V2,"It was another surprising detour in a career composed almost exclusively of detours: Isobel Campbell, former Belle & Sebastian member and sometime solo act, teamed with Mark Lanegan, taciturn former Screaming Trees singer and serial collaborator. With the release of their Ballad of the Broken Seas, the ""Beauty and the Beast"" lines came fast and furious. So did the Nancy and Lee comparisons, which were probably welcome. The pairing of Lanegan and Campbell may have come as a shock to fans of the latter (and maybe even the former) but the music itself was less than revelatory. Indeed, the Lee Hazelwood/Nancy Sinatra template is iconic for a reason, and to borrow it means to risk imitating them. It also means treading closely to Leonard Cohen, Scott Walker, or any other somber, late-1960s orchestral pop act. Still, the results were beautiful and brooding, with Campbell's songwriting significantly enhanced by this very specific setting. Sequels, however, are inherently built on familiarity and a sequel to the solid yet by-the-books Ballad of the Broken Seas could be as problematic as the Hollywood models are. Yet while Sunday at Devil Dirt may be more of the same (with glimpses of Tom Waits' junkyard blues tossed in to good effect), Campbell and Lanegan were never out to do anything different. Once again, melancholy, minor-key folk melodies, and bits of spy-theme and spaghetti-western cool color the album, typically enhanced by only the classiest of accompaniment-- upright bass, strings, brushed drums, twangy electric guitars, and other chamber-pop mainstays. And once again, Campbell works better as a supporting player on her own record than as a leader, cooing and chiming away in the background. Sure, she provides most of the songwriting, but it's Lanegan who provides the gravitas. Fortunately, Campbell seems to realize her place here as writer and arranger first and foremost, generally ceding the spotlight to Lanegan on the likes of the bleak (of course) ""The Raven"" and ""Back Burner"", the somewhat lighter country-blues of ""Salvation"" and ""Sally Don't You Cry"", and the spare folk of ""Something to Believe"". Compared to Lanegan, Campbell sounds thin singing lead on ""Shot Gun Blues"" or as duet partner on ""Who Built the Road"" and ""The Flame That Burns"". Her vocals are almost like post-production special effects. In a lot of ways that's what makes the disc such a good, breezy listen. Campbell's turn on ""Come On Over (Turn Me On)"" aims for sultry yet can't get beyond sweet and innocent; in Lanegan, however, she's found a substitute singer that's a perfect match for the strength of her compositions, a rumbling, grumbling vessel through which to channel her songs, themselves channeling the vibe of a lost but not forgotten time of smoky bars, scratchy jukeboxes, convertibles, open roads, broken hearts, cheap motels, and cheaper thrills. It's a bit like a dust-specked and flickering faux Super-8 road trip reel, with Campbell manning the camera and sitting in the director's chair and Lanegan glowering away in the uncomfortable glare of the sun.","The second album from odd-couple collaborators Isobel Campbell and Mark Lanegan feels a touch phony but hardly phoned in. He's got the voice, she's got the songs, and together they take us back to the late 60s.

Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul [Collector's Edition],Otis Redding,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5919d034d5c69bf5054/1:1/w_160/af08e046.jpg,2008-05-09 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11376-otis-blue-otis-redding-sings-soul-collectors-edition/,RhinoVoltRhinoVolt,"On July 8, 1965, Otis Redding was a young soul singer of modest renown, less than three months removed from releasing his first Top 10 r&b hit single. By July 10, he had become something else entirely: It took only 24 hours to lay down 10 of the 11 songs that would make up Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul, arguably the 1960s' greatest studio-recorded soul LP. (The only track not recorded at that time was the #2 hit, ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"".) Friends and associates had noticed Redding's growing confidence as a singer, and once Otis Blue hit shelves it was clear he was poised enough to pick up the mantle of the recently slain legend Sam Cooke, up to that point the greatest soul singer in America. He was also prepared to take on the Temptations and the Rolling Stones and B.B.King on their own turf; the only way to top him would be to give one of his original compositions to Aretha Franklin (""Respect""). In the simplest terms: It's a hell of a record, the crowning achievement of a man who could sound pained and celebratory and tender and gritty and proud all at once, with a voice that everyone from John Fogerty to Swamp Dogg to Cee-lo owes a debt to. Rhino's 2xCD Collector's Edition of Otis Blue makes a good case for this 24-hour labor of love as a wide-reaching document that just gets better with context. A set this packed-- including rarities, alternate mixes, live versions of the album tracks, and the original LP in both mono and stereo-- could easily feel sprawling and overstuffed, but it does a great job illuminating every tweaked nuance and permutation that Redding and his top-notch band could come up with during the course of a song's lifetime. Considering the personnel involved in the original LP-- Booker T. & the M.G.'s guitarist Steve Cropper, bassist Donald ""Duck"" Dunn, and drummer Al Jackson Jr.; keyboardist Isaac Hayes; a horn section (saxophonists Floyd Newman and Andrew Love, trumpet players Wayne Jackson and Gene Miller) filled with members of the Mar-Keys and the Memphis Horns-- it's a blessing to hear them both unified in mono and isolated in stereo. (Any concerns of redundancy can be allayed thusly: the mono version's for your speakers; stereo's for your headphones. You need them both.) And the singer holding it together is at the top of his game. There's the possibility that the death of Cooke not only inspired Redding to record three of his idol's most well-known songs, but spurred him to step up and fill an aching void in popular music, and it's not blasphemous to suggest that Otis measures up. His version of ""Wonderful World"" matches the original's tone of winsome modesty and gives it a rougher edge, and his juke-joint version of ""Shake"" is a hard-swinging, full-throated 2:40 of precision ferocity with a force that would flat-out explode during his live sets. But ""Change Gonna Come"", his take on Cooke's civil rights anthem ""A Change Is Gonna Come"", is the real gem of the three: the moment he sings ""I was born by the river,"" you can tell he knows what he's been entrusted with, and he handles it superbly with a mix of raspy frustration and wounded gentleness that's part trained virtuosity and part raw emotion. Like most other albums of the time, there's no shortage of covers, most of which fall under the milieu of Southern rhythm & blues: a sweltering take on B.B. King's ""Rock Me Baby"", with some of the best-timed ""heh"" asides this side of James Brown; a stomping version of Solomon Burke's ""Down in the Valley"" that ratchets up both the gospel beatitude and the secular lust; the staggering reworking of William Bell's ""You Don't Miss Your Water"" that has one of the most devastating pleading-man lead vocals in the entire Stax catalog. But there's also two other covers that really show what Redding could do in a different sort of pop context. Of all the versions of ""My Girl"" that sprang up in the wake of the Tempations' career-making December 1964 release, Otis' is especially inspired, twisting its familiar melodies against it and interjecting a few unexpected pauses and shifted inflections; the way he delivers its once-familiar chorus just a little off-balance can deke you right out of your socks. (Much of Redding's popularity in the UK hinged on this track, which was released in England by Atlantic to capitalize on the fact that it was one of the few places the Temptations' version hadn't caught on.) And his transformative take on ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", growling and sneering and wailing against a 90-mph backbeat sounds like even more of an impressive accomplishment whenyou take into account the fact that he hadn't even heard the Rolling Stones' original version at the time he recorded the song. He simply went off the lyrics and embellished them where he saw fit-- underscoring the ""fashion"" in ""satisfaction"" or throwing in new verses that turned Mick and Keith's restlessness into sheer uncontrollability (""I keep on runnin' round in my sleep/ I keep on messin' up any beat""). The covers are supplemented on this collection by four originals, two of which-- the mournfully harried ""Ole Man Trouble"" and the Jerry Butler-co-written ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"" with its priceless ending crescendo of desperation-- are evidence enough that he wasn't just a flashy interpreter. Another is ""I'm Depending on You"", the B-side to ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"", and it's a simple, perfectly fine vehicle for him to turn unremarkable lyrics into remarkable vocalizations. The other one, of course, is ""Respect""-- the song that Redding liked to joke was ""stolen"" from him by Aretha Franklin. It's true, in a sense-- Franklin claimed ownership of the song the moment she recorded it-- but it would be doing Redding a great disservice to consider his original an afterthought. Even without the brassy attitude and feminist overtones in Franklin's iconic rendition, Redding's performance is singular enough to avoid being canceled out. His band's performance isn't as much of a first-round-knockout as the one by the team Jerry Wexler and Arif Mardin assembled for the Queen of Soul (no slight-- what performance is?), but had it never been covered, Redding's version would be more vividly remembered as one of his greatest moments as a singer and a songwriter: it's no small feat to take the situation of a man asking for respect from a woman and deliver it while sounding more like a romantic diplomat than a chauvinist asshole. Better yet, there's an alternate version-- recorded around 1967 under unclear circumstances-- that compresses it all into a hectic, high-speed 1:51. It is completely insane. Redding wasn't yet famous enough in September '65 to circumvent one of the era's most unfortunate record company practices: instead of Redding's face on the cover of Otis Blue, there's a blue-tinted photo of a non-descript white lady. But through 1966 and early 1967, Redding had steadily built on his notoriety and recognition amongst both black r&b and white rock audiences by structuring one of pop music's most energizing live shows largely on the backbone of this album's material. This collection gathers selected Otis Blue tracks and B-sides from his April 1966 sets at Los Angeles' Whisky a Go Go and his mesmerizing March 1967 performance recorded for that year's Live in Europe, the last Otis Redding recording released during his lifetime. The two shows couldn't be more different: The L.A. show features a crew of musicians that trade the studio band's painstaking precision for a rough, loose, almost garage-band quality-- ""Ole Man Trouble"" damn near sounds like it's backed by an especially raw nu-funk group like El Michels Affair -- and the Europe show sports Booker T. & the M.G.s in their tourniquet-tight entirety, roaring to be heard over an armada of screaming teenagers. Redding sounds at home in both venues, pouring his heart into each song and singing it the way you'd want a brand-new fan to hear it-- and all those brand-new fans came about because of an album that took one day to create.",,10,
Films,Sonic Sum,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5d8c0084474cd0c24bc/1:1/w_160/8d4e9571.jpg,2008-05-08 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11440-films/,Definitive Jux,"Originally a Japan-only release, Films, Sonic Sum's follow-up to their 2000 debut Sanity Annex, has been unavailable on these shores for the past four years. It's not hard to see why. Rob Sonic, Def Jux solo artist and the sole MC between Sonic Sum's three globe-scattered producers, works in note-card lyricism, avoiding things like breath control, fluid enjambment, or narrative. Examples from Films of his evacuated line breaks, grating twenty-dollar flourishes of polysyllabic, Latinate words, and asinine emphatics (""UN-inter-EST/ Ready to AD-minister RE-flex, HA-mmer, WA-ter drips"") could fill double-wide Moleskine. Subject matter is non-existent. That's an intentional move, of course, giving Sonic carte blanche to splatter ""underground"" tropes of programming, city-as-The-Matrix malaise, romantic disappointment dressed up as city-as-The-Matrix malaise (""Emergency!/ Override!/ Won't confide in you!"" from ""Negatives""), and, of course, people who just don't get it. And if the box for style, poetics, and form goes unchecked, the same vacancy, sadly, would have to appear in the every-sticky space known as persona. Sonic so clearly sounds a graduate of the Aesop Rock school of monotone-as-solemnity. When he ejects monosyllabic imperative nuggets-- ""Dislodge/ Distill/ Quit job/ Sit still"" (from ""Choking Victim"")-- there's no shift in timbre or exigency. This is rap as summary. Though there is a more than enough sin in the melodies of Films (patchouli-scented, ambling guitar riffs and glib ""vintage"" news reel dialog samples are the nastiest sonic refrains), the album has a few effective Def Jux melodies. ""Rocket"" has an eventide of misty snares rising over shadowy synths; there's a surprisingly bedroom-ready sitar and slick bell section duel on the title track. The problem is that the other three producers besides Sonic-- Fred Ones, Preservation, and Eric M.O.-- never stray to far from dirgy, mid-tempo ""burners."" Their missteps interlock: Fred Ones' ""Films"" is a series of rusted guitar loops over a series of synthpop basslines. Eric M.O. tries to bliss out his hi-hats so much they smear in to nothingness under night-sky synths. The melodies, like the lyrics, shovel and crowd instead of shaping and deliniating. The beat guys get to at least share the blame. Taking Rob Sonic and Films to task isn't fun. In every interview, and even on the fleetingly passable moments here, Sonic comes across as the type of MC you'd like to see succeed: He knows where he comes from (the D.C. 'burbs, for the record), he confesses his influences and musical loves, and he's appropriately wary about hip-hop's perceived disconnect with a common reality. But desire and ambient political awareness do not a microphone controller make. As he's busy defining and decrying the other MCs, contradicting his own proletariat love (""Who complains more than the basic/ Complacent/ Patience""), Sonic perhaps gets closer the mirror than he'd like, ""Me sitting cramped, flanked by my/ Forget it/ Reminding you of how much better someone else said it.""","Originally a Japan-only release, the follow-up to 2000 debut Sanity Annex by underground hip-hop project Sonic Sum has been unavailable in the States for the past four years.

Laughter's An Asshole/Lion Land,Quinn Walker,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5fbc0084474cd0c24f5/1:1/w_160/b1ad2061.jpg,2008-05-08 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11678-laughters-an-assholelion-land/,Voodoo-EROS,"The cover of Quinn Walker's Laughter's an Asshole/Lion Land depicts the artist, horns sprouting from his hairy head with what appears to be rainbow colored flames shooting from his mouth. But is Walker breathing fire, or is this proverbial ""Technicolor yawn"" in full effect? Walker likely intended the former, but the latter is more apt. After all, Laughter's an Asshole/Lion Land is spread out over two sprawling discs, not as a double but as two albums for the price of one. Yes, Walker's amassed so much music he's basically giving it away-- at least until Walker accumulates still more music to stuff on the next release. That shouldn't be a problem, since listening to these discs it's clear that everything must come out, like a big, messy, cleansing, gut-clearing barf. You think Devendra Banhart is all Id? You ain't heard nothing yet. And yet Walker's over-the-top approach-- massed vocals, kitchen sink instrumentation-- adequately, even impressively disguises the dearth of actual songs. ""Bing Bang Boom"", for example, is an ace approximation of Tropicalia, but it's still really just an exercise. Similarly, ""Baby Neon"", ""Up Here the Air Is Fresh and Sweet"", and ""At the Party, in the Woods"" are wacky, whacked-out helium voiced indulgences; the rest of the disc is alternately beautiful, silly, fantastic, goofy, and wonderful mood pieces akin to the Animal Collective axis. It's all so unpredictable, so inherently whimsical, colorful and kaleidoscopic, that it's practically psychedelic by default. The lack of focus is the focus, and on those paradoxical terms it's a pretty wild and wooly success. That's Laughter's an Asshole, at least. Lion Land is even more homebrew, the kind of catchall that DIY allows and encourages. It makes room for Ween-y ballads like ""Save Your Love For Me"" and the dreamy pop collision ""Heaven With You Tonight"", for the 1960s-styled bad trip freakout of ""Through the Skull of a Goat"" and the symphonic synths of ""Let Freedom Ring"", and for the harmony-rich, bigger than the Beach Boys swoon of ""Warm in the Sun/Worn in the Sun"". Whether there's room, or even a need, for all these ideas, all at once, is another matter. These tracks were recorded by Walker, mostly alone, in his bedroom, two years ago, and only recently got issued as this 2xCD trove of a debut. In retrospect, it sounds a little ahead of the curve, or at least perfectly in tune with passing trends. But it also sounds awfully familiar in light of all the likeminded acts proliferating as of late. If an album is novel and original much the same way another album is novel and original, does that mean the album's not really novel and original? Maybe it's best to just follow Walker's example and blaze blindly straight ahead, head held high. Not all winners come in first.","Brooklyn bedroom weirdo belatedly compiles brilliant, baffling sonic bouillabaisse.

Johnny B.

His songs fueled and inspired the likes of Buddy Holly, the Beach Boys, the Beatles, the Who, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, and just about anybody in his wake who picked up an electric guitar. In the invaluable rock doc Hail! Hail! Rock'n'Roll, we watch in awe has Berry puts Keith Richards in his place with just a single angry glare, and watch in double-awe as Richards takes it. After all, the Stones guitarist, like countless other musicians of his generation, knows he owes virtually everything to Berry, and has admitted as much, so he gives deference where deference is due. Berry's as worthy of hagiography as any rock legend, but he's not yet ready for a eulogy. In fact, Berry's 50-plus year career has been marked by one constant-- forward motion. Indeed, Berry's far too stubborn a man to ever give inertia the chance to slow him down, and he still spends a considerable amount of time on stage for an octogenarian. As far as the studio goes, however, Berry hasn't released a new album since 1979, and even then his songwriting had been in steady decline since the early 60s. His last (and sole number one!) hit, a live version of the juvenile novelty ""My Ding-a-Ling"", was released in 1972. One perverse but still appropriate way to view Berry's erratic (or non-existent) output over the past three or so decades is as further validation of the enduring strength of the first decade of his recording career, especially the productive, world-changing last five years of the 1950s collected on the self-explanatory Johnny B. Goode: His Complete '50s Chess Recordings. It was on Chicago's Chess imprint that Berry would change the blueprint of popular music, and it's on this 4xCD collection that we can revisit the fruits of his labor. Of course, Berry's singles are such a firm part of the pop lexicon that one may feel they don't need revisiting in 2008. Yet it's still both useful and enjoyable to blast tracks like ""Maybellene"", ""Sweet Little Sixteen"", ""Johnny B. Goode"", ""Carol"", ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"", ""Roll Over Beethoven"", ""Too Much Monkey Business"", ""School Day (Ring! Ring! Goes the Bell)"", ""Rock and Roll Music"", ""Memphis Tennessee"", ""Little Queenie"", ""Run Rudolph Run"", or ""Back in the U.S.A."" and, if only for each of their two or three minutes, a least pretend that you've never heard them before. Put yourself in the shoes of some kid stumbling across them on the radio before bedtime: How could you not buy a guitar and follow suit? But while His Complete '50s Chess Recordings contains the bulk of Berry's greatest hits, it's also, well, complete, which means some less than epochal songs are there to for career context (hell, even a couple of the singles, like 1956's hokey pidgin English ""Havana Moon"", don't show Berry at his most formidable). The collection is also not exactly complete, which is fine, as far the set's listenability. The liners note, for example, 13 existing takes of ""Sweet Little Sixteen"", but it's probably best to accept the compilers judgment when they only include five of them. In fact, beyond the obvious singles and hits, it's in the alternate versions of several very well known songs-- demos, aborted takes and the like-- that this set may be most fascinating. According to the notes, several reels of unmarked or anonymously dated tapes (with names like ""Long Fast Jam, Long Slow Jam 9/58"") often disguised hidden treats providing clues to some ongoing puzzles (such as the participation of piano player Johnnie Johnson, whom many cite-- and Johnson attempted to litigate-- as one major source of Berry's sound). ""Reelin' and Rockin'"" didn't get it totally right until take 10, but here we can hear take one and tell for ourselves why that one and the other nine takes didn't make the cut. We hear the 2nd take of ""Johnny B. Goode"" aborted by Berry, who bitches about the piano sounding too much like ""Roll Over Beethoven""-- ""stay away from that"", he snaps, before kicking right into take three (which sounds pretty damned good). So the question remains: Did he know? Did Berry know not just the difference between the right take and the wrong take, but that the right takes were writing the rules of rock, laying down the template for so many to follow? Considering Berry's ego is part of the public record, one presumes the man himself would say ""yes"" without blinking. But even if you didn't believe him, or trust his perspective, the music here really does speak for itself. It's an equation proven sound again and again: Quantity plus quality equals immortality.","Everything-- or at least everything that matters-- recorded by Chuck Berry for Chess in the 1950s. Rock'n'roll is older than Chuck Berry, but one can argue this collection as much as any collection documents where rock'n'roll as we know it really begins.

My Bloody Underground,The Brian Jonestown Massacre,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5ff13d197565213ad66/1:1/w_160/58c2b818.jpg,2008-05-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11478-my-bloody-underground/,A,"Back when the Brian Jonestown Massacre became the newest Next Big Thing-- releasing albums at the rate of Bob Pollard powered by Red Bull, flirting with interested record labels of varying liquidity, engaging in slapfights with the Dandy Warhols and fistfights with bandmates-- the myth and mystique surrounding the group all but drowned out its songs. All the while, frontman Anton Newcombe wanted people to believe he was a burgeoning genius bucking the establishment, a tortured outcast inspired by and continuing the work begun by his spiritual forefathers from the 1960s, including one or both of the guys whose names or notorious actions were jacked for use in Newcombe's little beat combo. With every subsequent release, however, the myth gave way to a less flattering portrait. Although Newcombe was talented enough to skillfully synthesize all sorts of musical touchstones, the end results were increasingly less inspiring, and his tendency to take decent ideas and beat them into the ground was maddening-- Newcombe never failed to take what could be a perfectly fine three-minute song and turn it into an interminable seven-minute dirge. Couple those aesthetic shortcomings with Newcombe's penchant for burning bridges and buying into his own out-of-proportion hype, and it's no wonder that the group quickly became yesterday's news. Ironically, Brian Jonestown Massacre's most public moment came courtesy of the 2004 documentary Dig!, with the film's unflattering portrayal of Newcombe and the group's overwrought inner turmoil showing exactly why the group would never become as big as Newcombe thought they should be. Undaunted, Newcombe and whomever he can sucker into joining his merry band soldier on, releasing records, playing out, causing the occasional ruckus. If the hope is to return to those salad days of potential world domination, lackluster albums like My Bloody Underground aren't going to help the cause. Given its title, it's fitting that the self-produced My Bloody Underground attempts to emulate both the gauzy atmospherics of My Bloody Valentine and the sparse efficiency of the Velvet Underground. Instead, the album often sounds more like a poorly recorded group of proficient amateurs giving it a go on fourth-hand guitars and some empty paint buckets, with the singer warbling through a pillow for good measure. The album's lead track (the name of which I'll get to later on) starts with a promising beat, but gets sideswiped not three seconds in by the intrusion of the meandering psychedelic guitar mangling one might stereotypically expect from a group beholden to that forever-romanticized era of free love. After six minutes of that, there's an electrified version of the same pointless stumble that lasts just as long. Most of the album offers variations on this sort of unending drone-- ""Who Fucking Pissed in My Well?"" is a non-vocal synth-driven take, ""Just Like Kicking Jesus"" goes the MBV seasick route, ""Who Cares Why"" sends the drone out into orbit, and the album's percussion-free conclusion is fittingly titled ""Black Hole Symphony"". Oddly enough, despite being the longest track on the entire record, it's probably the most palatable. The songs that avoid this sonic quicksand aren't worth much, either-- successes like the haunting ""Ljosmyndir"" and refreshingly aggressive ""Golden - Frost"" are few and far between. Instead, there's ""Yeah - Yeah"", a haze-free number where Newcombe's usually submerged vocals take center stage to offer a litany of ridiculous couplets. There's also a pleasant enough piano instrumental, supposedly written by Newcombe when he was nine years old, that soon overstays its welcome. And in case the album couldn't be any more obnoxious, the title of this track is ""We Are the Niggers of the World"". More so than the album's overall malaise and inconsistency, it's this ridiculous (and in some cases, offensive) attempt at ""edginess"" that's most off-putting. Stunts like naming the album's first track ""Bring Me the Head of Paul McCartney on Heather Mills' Wooden Peg (Dropping Bombs on the White House)"", or calling one of Underground's high points ""Automatic Faggot for the People"" are the sort of look-at-me tactics that one would hope would be beneath a 40-year-old. They're also better reserved for music that doesn't sound like canon-beholden Mojo bait. Watching the videos Newcombe and friends posted to YouTube to accompany a leak of Underground tracks near the end of 2007-- Newcombe spray-painting corny epithets on hallways, Newcombe wrecking and burning all sorts of crap in a forced pique of Keith Moonian splendor, Newcombe getting the word ISLAND tattooed inside his lower lip-- only exacerbates how silly and self-indulgent his half-assed attempts at artistic martyrdom are, and have been. The myth of the Brian Jonestown Massacre-- a construct that holds weight only with the hopelessly converted-- has always superseded and surpassed the actual work of the Brian Jonestown Massacre. Even now, when that myth is but a shadow of its former glory, that still holds true.","Given its title, it's fitting that this self-produced record attempts to emulate both the gauzy atmospherics of My Bloody Valentine and the sparse efficiency of the Velvet Underground.

Supreme Balloon,Matmos,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6115e6ef959693228a1/1:1/w_160/8c71919f.jpg,2008-05-08 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11492-supreme-balloon/,Matador,"Ever since the IDM scene they emerged from in the late 1990s withered away and died, Matmos have thrived, in the process making a compelling case for themselves as electronic music's resident white coats. Beginning with 2001's A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure, the combined output of Martin Schmidt and Drew Daniel (a Pitchfork contributor) so far this decade has seen them work within the form of some pre-established conceptual constraint. A Chance to Cut saw them fashion malformed, sideways techno out of samples culled from the operating theater; 2003's The Civil War was a blissfully uncool meditation on medieval instrumentation and American folk history; and 2006's The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast, their most audacious and satisfying record, was a collection of bespoke sound and thought experiments dedicated to a cast of gay or closeted figures: Ludwig Wittgenstein, Larry Levan, Valerie Solanas, King Ludwig II of Bavaria. It might be tempting for non-fans to imagine these conceptual parameters as being too intellectually grounded to yield much in the way of, oh, you know, fun, but fans have come to embrace them as part of the deal. That's partly because of Matmos' inherent sense of playfulness, humor, and energy-- they're just as comfortable being buffoons or instigators as they are intellectuals. But it's also because there's something strangely engaging about their transparent working process. If you know the backstory to a particular record, it's impossible to hear it and not entertain questions about how they might work within those bounds. By the simple act of listening, you become a participant. But unlike The Rose Has Teeth, which might easily have come with an annotated bibliography of assigned supplementary reading, the underpinning idea behind Supreme Balloon revolves around a simple aesthetic limitation. This time around, Schmidt and Daniel stashed away their DAT recorders, microphones, and idle hurdy gurdys and vowed to record using only synthesizers as input sources. While there's comparatively little in the way of outside text to grapple with as a result, the decision opens the door on some gorgeous sonic shifts; spanning everything from standard-issue old-school Moogs, Arps, and Waldorfs to slightly more obscure modular antiques (indeed, if The Rose Has Teeth underlined Schmidt and Daniel's day jobs as accomplished academics, this exposes them as shameless gearsluts), Supreme Balloon is a woozily beautiful-sounding record, as crystalline, gleaming, and full-bodied as vintage Terry Riley. That throwback spirit is underscored by the album's sequencing. Supreme Balloon comes split into two discernible sides, the former a collection of five ""pop"" numbers that includes the futzed-up circuitry of opener ""Rainbow Flag"", the punchy, almost-techno of the sprightly ""Polychords"", and the carbonated, 8-bit harp glissandos of ""Exciter Lamp"" (which features, weirdly and wonderfully, a brief passage from ""O Canada""). Side two begins with the album's obvious centerpiece; clocking in at over 23 minutes long, the eponymously-titled ""Supreme Balloon"" is a chasm-wide, slow burning bit of analog psychedelia that conjures up very obvious comparisons to Vangelis and Tangerine Dream in their mid-70s heyday. A bubbling drone piece called ""Cloudhopper"" acts as the closer, and we're done. Supreme Balloon features contributions from Keith Fullerton Whitman, Jay Lesser, and Sun Ra Arkestra's Marshall Allen, among others, while Riley himself appears on a bonus track of the iTunes version of the record. In the end, those appearances point to the album's only downside, which is the nagging sense that there's too much straight homage/pastiche and not enough of Matmos' considerable cleverness on display. Ultimately, though, it's a minor quibble; as Matmos surely know, beautiful sounds are their own kind of reward.","They're still working with an overriding concept, but this time Martin Schmidt and Drew Daniel of Matmos focus on a simple aesthetic limitation: using only synthesizers as input sources. While there's little in the way of outside text to grapple with as a result, the decision opens the door on some gorgeous sonic shifts.

What I Want From You Is Sweet,Orion Rigel Dommisse,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c6c0084474cd0c2497/1:1/w_160/4d3fc512.jpg,2008-05-07 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11424-what-i-want-from-you-is-sweet/,Language of Stone,"At first glance, Orion Rigel Dommisse's debut What I Want From You Is Sweet sounds like the output of another fanciful bard in the Joanna Newsom mold: electric cello player singing narrative set pieces about twin girls telling ghost stories, hushed conclusions about the flesh (""The body is a breathing thing/ I'd like to keep it warm"") under sweeping strings courtesy of Espers star and album producer Greg Weeks. It's even on a cozy imprint (Language of Stone) of Newsom's home label Drag City. But something dark and serrated is hidden among all those would-be costume folds. Upper register vocals and manicured strings and Wurlitzer aside, this album is ten songs (a taut 38 minutes) of sylvan murder ballads, equal parts Nick Cave fatalism and delusional, pastoral noir. Look no further than the ominous, grayscale cover art: a grove gone to seed; sinister, overfed goats circling a well in the foreground; a black growth bulging from a tree; a young woman walking a path to a beat-up trailer tilting in the background. The album opens with a song called ""Fake Yer Death"" and a line of grim prescription-- ""Fake your death/ If you need to""-- which unfolds into the macabre instructional (""Make sure the bones look something like your own""). Then a haunting narrative about two questionable young girls (Ghosts? Murderers?) luring a man to his death in the ocean set above a nodding Omnichord waltz (""Alice and Sarah""). Then, on ""Simon Sent For Me"", 8-bit piano twinkles and another string of troubling imperatives: ""Get out of the ocean/ Get into the cave/ Don't drink from haunted fountains/ Stop rubbing graves."" Message: received. As a vocalist, Dommisse stays guile. She's extremely choosy about how and where she articulates her lines. On ""Suicide Kiss (Because Dead)"", she buries each line's first half, smothering words under rising tidal strings and ambient buzz that the listener can only retrieve single images and phrases until the hook, ""Because death, because death/ Will open my heart,"" intercedes. Death holds court on Sweet. It's the featured word in four of the album's ten song titles. And it's the revisited, reexamined subject of pretty much every line and sentiment on the album. Even when Dommisse trots out an uptempo, nearly-major-chord song (""Capricorn""), she uses it to link her speaker with the astrological goat-- a traditional symbol of, among other things, lechery, winter, formality, and darkness. Dommisse keeps the darkness relatively compelling. As the Plath-like obsessions veer into monochrome, the sounds of Sweet become, consciously or unconsciously, an attempt to balance the pervading shade of the album. Her cello feels wedded to her murky lyricism, so it's the troika of Dommisse's electric piano, Omnichord, and Wurlitzer that anchor the lighter, almost fanciful electronic backgrounds (her MySpace page playfully has Legend of Zelda as one of her influences). This is a tricky balancing act, and Sweet does a fine job keeping its sharpness and its hidden, er, sweetness, in dialogue. Nearly 40 minutes of a gloomy wood nymph debut is as much as any sane listener can handle, but it speaks well of the album that after all those fatal lessons and imperatives, there are still some very real questions left over. Namely, what stories does Dommisse have left to tell? And how many people are going to die?","On her debut album, Dommisse sounds like a fanciful bard in the Joanna Newsom mold, an electric cello player singing narrative set pieces about twin girls telling ghost stories; but something dark and serrated is hidden among all those would-be costume folds.

Tickley Feather,Tickley Feather,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f1ea9e61561daa6eae/1:1/w_160/2626f163.jpg,2008-05-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11463-tickley-feather/,Paw Tracks,"Tickley Feather's debut long-player opens with a small child's voice drawling, somewhat disconcertingly, ""I've got magic inside my bones somewhere."" Similar spoken snippets are scattered throughout the record, each centering around the words ""bones"" or ""magic,"" or both. Clearly the repetition is intentional and well-considered, as you'd be hard-pressed to come up with two terms that better convey the essence of a skeletally lo-fi album that pulls its bliss from such improbable places. The brainchild of Philadelphia resident Annie Sachs, Tickley Feather's scratchy bedroom probings slot nicely next to fellow Paw Tracks alum Ariel Pink, yet (as is the case with Pink), she's not nearly as musically dynamic or engaging as the kingpins of her loose coterie, Animal Collective. The song title ""Keyboards Is Drunk"" is a succinct summation of Sachs' approach (she's clearly quite fond of straightforward nomenclature-- see also titles like ""Rain Bucket"" and ""Leaking Roof""), as she utilizes wobbly, simplistic key patterns and layers them with largely indecipherable singsong melodies or chirpy yells, occasionally a low-rent drum track, and other sonic detritus. This is the kind of record where hiss, feedback, and even the abstract concepts of cheapness and obfuscation are more or less instruments as well, coloring and shaping what we hear, burying certain motifs while embellishing others. Given her deliberately limited palette, it makes sense that Sachs' tracks would start to sound a bit same-y, with their abbreviated running times admittedly a saving grace, as even three and a half minutes of ""Night Train"" interminably attests. Still, there are plenty of standouts here, haunting or earworm-ish moments like the ""tra la la""s of ""Le Daylight"" or the relatively long, smudgy vocal lines that sprout into melodies on ""The Python"" and ""Night Chant"". As you'd expect, even minor departures from the blueprint stand out, with magnified thrills arising from the booming ""Psycho Killer"" bass of ""Sorry Party"" and the harsher electro edge of ""Tonight Is the Nite"" (both of which also find Sachs yelling more than usual). As a standalone artifact Tickley Feather has plenty of charm, yielding something furtive but friendly for those who penetrate its mountains of artlessness and hiss. However, the jury's still out on whether there's enough here to build a sustainable and rewarding aesthetic.","The brainchild of Philadelphia native Annie Sachs, Tickley Feather creates scratchy bedroom probings that slot nicely next to fellow Paw Tracks alum Ariel Pink, yet she's not nearly as musically dynamic or engaging as the kingpins of her loose coterie, Animal Collective.

Funky Nassau: The Compass Point Story 1980-1986,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b590b1335d7bf169a908/1:1/w_160/fd817ac9.jpg,2008-05-07 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11374-funky-nassau-the-compass-point-story-1980-1986/,Strut,"On the surface, this compilation is intended to be a broad rundown of a specific studio's output-- that of Compass Point, the Bahamian outpost established by Island Records founder Chris Blackwell and manned by a who's who of reggae session players including the ace production team/rhythm section of Sly & Robbie. But it might as well be a symposium on the polyglot tendencies that made the dance underground of the first half of the 1980s so unpredictably rich in ideas. Name a genre that either established itself or peaked in the late 70s or early 80s-- electro-funk, disco, reggae, dub, post-punk, old-school hip-hop-- and it's represented in the music on this compilation, rarely without being comfortably fused to another genre to spectacular effect. The most well-known cuts on Funky Nassau: The Compass Point Story 1980-1986 might as well be shorthand for this type of fusion-- Tom Tom Club's chirpy, blissed-out Caribbean/new wave/rap pastiche ""Genius of Love"", Talking Heads' jittery Afrobeat-inflected digital rave-up ""Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)"", and an extended version of Ian Dury's BBC-banned ""Spasticus Autisticus"", which retorted to Britain's patronizing declaration of 1981 as ""Year of the Disabled"" with Spartacus-lifted shouts of solidarity, bitingly arch lyrics (""So place your hard-earned peanuts in my tin/ And thank the creator you're not in the state I'm in"") and a vertigo-inducing bass/synth interplay. There's just one baffling decision in the famous names department-- instead of something from the superb Nightclubbing, Grace Jones' tenure at Compass Point is represented by the digital reggae of ""My Jamaican Guy"", and the combination of her flat singing and the gradual tedium of its seven-minute extended mix makes for an unexciting way to open the compilation. But Funky Nassau gets better in a hurry, thanks not just to the usual post-punk suspects but also due to the fringe artists, obscurities, and ostensible novelty records (emphasis on novel) that fill out the bulk of the collection. There are two tracks that, thanks largely to house music pioneer François Kevorkian, prove to be the collection's most surprising highlights. Cuban-born Guy Cuevas' 1982 France-exclusive ""Obsession"" piles glimmering keyboards on top of a Bernard Edwards-caliber bassline and comes up with a late-disco gem that sounds triangulated between Havana, Paris, and NYC. And the Kevorkian mix of ""Dance Sucker"", the 1983 debut single from Scottish obscurities Set the Tone, sounds like a uprocker's take on a circa-1988 Nine Inch Nails demo, with a lead singer belting out sneering Reznor-isms (and the occasional Nic Offer-ism) over a packed wall of electro. Where most of the tracks on Funky Nassau breathe free with loose-jointed smoothness, disco deconstructionist Cristina's ""You Rented a Space"" is a claustrophobic slab of electronic dub where the percolating bass and the staggering but sure-footed rhythms practically corner you in a hallway and breathe down your neck. (Cristina's decadently sly voice knows better, and aims directly at your inner ear: ""Your lovin' is as cold as the cold clasp of death."") And then there's Bits & Pieces-- basically Sly & Robbie working under an alias- - cranking out a playful but heavy cover of Yarbrough & Peoples' 1980 hit ""Don't Stop the Music"", replicating its fuzzed-out synth-funk faithfully but throwing in a subtle reggae backbeat and, for kicks, a few likeably daft rap lyrics about hairstyles. The Compass Point sound proved that the sound of the Caribbean could cover just about anywhere-- and, at the same time, helped create music that couldn't have come from anywhere else.","A sampler of music recorded at Chris Blackwell's studio in the Bahamas, this record is also a symposium on the polyglot tendencies that made the dance underground of the first half of the 1980s so unpredictably rich in ideas.

The Evangelist,Robert Forster,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f8c0084474cd0c24ec/1:1/w_160/dd2ccc31.jpg,2008-05-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11470-the-evangelist/,Yep Roc,"The Go-Betweens' initial break-up followed a fruitful span of six classic records, so when principals Robert Forster and Grant McLennan went their separate ways in 1989, there was at least a sense of mission accomplished. At the time, with solo careers embarked upon and new collaborators recruited, few expected the pair to reconvene as the Go-Betweens, which they eventually did roughly 10 years later. With the untimely 2006 death of McLennan came a sickening feeling of permanence, however; the excellent Oceans Apart would serve as the Go-Betweens' true swan song. Making the loss of McLennan all the more painful was Forster's reminiscence in Australia's The Monthly (for whom Forster has become a cultural critic), that ""we were on the cusp of something,"" and that ""album number 10 was going to be something special."" It's impossible to listen to Forster's The Evangelist without thinking of McLennan, but to his credit Forster has designed it that way. Three songs were in fact co-written with McLennan, bequeathed to Forster to reveal to the world and break our hearts all over again. ""Demon Days"" in particular works eerily like a self-penned eulogy, something that Forster was quite aware of: ""I played it a couple of days after he died,"" recalled Forster in a recent interview in The Age, ""and it was an extraordinary moment because I was the only other person who knew this song existed and I've got this thing, this masterpiece, which is so fragile, because if I'd died three days after him, the song wouldn't exist."" It's a tough listen made all the more touching with the brief appearance of a muted chorus and a swooning string arrangement courtesy of Audrey Riley (who handled the same duties on Liberty Belle & the Black Diamond Express). It's also another indiciation, if another were needed, of the brilliance of the Forster/McLennan team. It's similarly easy to imagine McLennan, not Forster, leading ""Let Your Light In, Babe"" and ""It Ain't Easy"", two more songs salvaged from the songwriter's works in progress notebook, and it's no surprise that his shadow spreads across much of the rest of The Evangelist as well. Forster, even though he occasionally collaborated directly with McLennan, is nonetheless a very different singer and songwriter, and his solo albums never hit the highs of McLennan's. Even here, after every great song like ""If It Rains"", ""Pandanus"", or the elegiac album-closing tearjerker ""From Ghost Town"", your mind is primed for McLennan's counterpart response. Aside from the aforementioned songs, they never come, of course, which partly explains why The Evangelist feels a little incomplete. It's not fair to Forster, of course, who rose to the occasion with his warmest and most welcoming solo album. But even beyond the imherant emotional baggage, songs such as ""Did She Overtake You"" or the slightly bombastic ""Don't Touch Anything"" still sound like they could have used a pass through someone else's filter. Yet if anything the album's slight flaws work as sideways tribute to Forster's late friend and partner. ""Something's not right, something's gone wrong,"" sings Forster, channeling McLennan, in ""Demon Days"". If anything's wrong with The Evangelist, it's not a problem that can be fixed. It's wrong like an empty chair at a banquet, unopened presents at a birthday party, a pile of uncollected mail on the front steps, or an unfinished novel that trails off into who knows where. It's wrong like even our fondest memories, cursed to fade with time.","Robert Forster's first release since the death of Grant McLennan, his late partner in the Go-Betweens, is also his best solo album.

Santogold,Santogold,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6059d034d5c69bf5110/1:1/w_160/b2e63668.jpg,2008-05-07 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11483-santogold/,AtlanticDowntownLizard King,"Santi White used to work in A&R, which gives her put-downs on debut single ""Creator"" a professional air: ""Sit tight I know what you are/ Mad bright but you ain't no star."" As Santogold, White is putting her knowledge of star quality into practical effect. At its best, her album's cross-genre confidence is dazzling, combining dub, new wave, and hip-hop to create some of the year's freshest pop. At its worst, it feels annoyingly overthought. The central questions of Santogold's first single, ""Creator"" (who's real and who's fake?), seem to nag at her, but its stunning follow-up, ""L.E.S. Artistes"", returns to the topic of creativity, hype, and integrity, with the singer sinking her teeth into Lower East Side poseurs and wannabes. White's also walking a line herself: She's a professional songwriter, and talked to the BBC earlier this year about writing for Ashlee Simpson. ""It's like two different hats that I have to wear. It's like the difference between writing fiction and writing ad copy. It's like a formula versus your art."" That's fair enough. It's not unlike the age-old compromise of film directors-- a movie for the studio, and a movie for me. The problem is that when you compartmentalize formula and art, you risk creating a formula for your art, defining it by what it isn't rather than what it is. Santogold's second half seems to fall into this trap, with a series of tepid dub-influenced tracks that kick her obvious pop gifts-- melody, hooks, and bounce-- to the curb. On ""Anne"", the usually fiery White sounds muted and apathetic; ""Starstruck"" is a patience-eroding mess of keyboard fuzz; and the grating ""Unstoppable"" feels like being lectured by a parrot. ""Unstoppable"" is also the track which sounds closest to White's friend and collaborator M.I.A. Hers is the name you'll think of first when you hear Santogold: They share co-producers Diplo and Switch, as well as a taste for bass and a forthright vocal style. The more you listen, though, the shallower the resemblance seems: Santi White can do M.I.A.'s tongue-swallowing bark if she wants to, but she's just as comfortable with the gentler registers her melodies require. And while M.I.A. uses global club music to project a future pop blueprint, Santogold explores how they integrate with renegade music of the past. For much of Santogold, White is channeling and recombining a series of indie icons: Debbie Harry, Kim Deal, Ari Up, Joe Strummer, and Karen O. On ""My Superman"" she captures the imperious swoop of Siouxsie Sioux and drapes it over the kind of stern electro Goldfrapp used to make. ""I'm a Lady"" marries ska-pop verses to a strutting Elastica chorus. ""Lights Out"" finds a fascinating middle ground between the Pixies and the Go-Go's. This could turn the record into a spot-the-reference game, but White glues it together first with the backing harmonies she uses to sweeten most tracks, and second with her love of space and echo. The early 1980s fascinate her, and I'd guess a big part of why has to do with the era's cross-breeding of rock, punk, and reggae. A trio of songs-- ""You'll Find a Way"", ""Shove It"", and ""Say Aha""-- evoke that moment when rock's aggression met reggae's drive and depth, and it makes for Santogold's most thrilling sequence. ""Say Aha"" in particular is perfect new wave bubblegum-- 2 Tone keyboards, phaser effects, a stomp-ready chorus, and a surf guitar solo to finish. As if to ward off accusations of revivalism, it leads into ""Creator"", a grimy arcade funk jam that's Santogold's heaviest and most successful electronic move. ""Creator"" has already soundtracked more than one commercial, and if ""L.E.S. Artistes"", Santogold's best song, gets similar exposure it could be inescapable. It already sounds huge, with its soaring chorus that should resonate with anyone facing change: ""I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up."" In Santi White's case ""it"" is stardom, and ""L.E.S. Artistes"" might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The irony of this song about compromise is that, like the other great tracks on Santogold, it shows exactly why she's in demand with Ashlee or Lily Allen: She's a consummate pop songwriter.

Brutal,Clear Tigers,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5dc5e6ef95969322846/1:1/w_160/d437ab59.jpg,2008-05-06 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11443-brutal/,self-released,"Brutal's cover art will be utterly ancillary to, if not totally absent from, the listening experience of the vast majority who hear it. Like most of today's self-released albums, the best way to access Clear Tigers' first LP is via eMusic and iTunes (and, of course, torrent sites) and fans will know its cover-- if they know it at all-- as an inscrutable 100-pixel square thumbnail. But Brutal may be as good an argument as any for buying the physical artifact, as its uncanny iconography-- a tiger-masked, singlet-wearing, rifle-toting dude astride a white steed against a Photoshopped ocean set-- succinctly sums up its various virtues and demerits. Like its cover art, the album can be dreamlike, thrilling, menacing, and WTF-ludicrous. Clear Tigers is Brooklynite Nathan Akin, who plays and sings (including some inventive backing vocals) everything. In ""Spookhouse"", a fraught folktronic reminiscence of Halloweens past, Akin chants in a weary, nasal sing-song over soap-bubble synths and torrid piano runs. Leavened with humor, the song nevertheless legitimizes childish anxieties by enumerating actual dangers: mothers ""scared into submission by the razor-blades in apples,"" children carving pumpkins that ""look like sex offenders who live just around the corner,"" and spook houses haunted by every grade school shorty's greatest terror-- teenage bullies. Other tracks, including opener ""Vacation"", which declares (albeit politely) over a throbbing guitar, ""You're not gonna take it/ Gonna start a revolution,"" are as richly informed by a child's hunger for control and personal agency. ""Igloo"", the album's best cut, rubs together shivering electronic and acoustic instruments and shuffles fleeting, fuzzy images to powerfully express that paradoxical feeling of jouissance and powerlessness, the push and pull of wanting to grow up/never grow up. Unfortunately, Akin's childhood source material isn't always so fertile. ""Won't Be Back"" and ""Summer School"" are sludgy grunge slabs that may fill in autobiographical gaps (betcha Akin idled his formative years air-guitar soloing to Mudhoney and the Smashing Pumpkins), but lack the courage of their convictions and come off as smarmy parody. Worse, plunked down next to one another in the center of the album, they KO any momentum and good will earned in the album's otherwise solid first half. Which may be just as well. After this grave error of sequencing, Brutal is basically a compost heap of recycled ideas-- exhausted folk strummers, an Elliott Smith knock-off, and what sounds like an Animal Collective 7"" played at 78. The achy, shimmering ""Deathray"" is the exception, and if you cordon off it and Brutal's first five tracks, you've got a good EP. Hey, you're downloading this thing anyway-- just order it à la carte.","Songs on Nathan Akin's one-man band debut-- ranging from exhausted folk strummers to an Elliott Smith knock-off to what sounds like an Animal Collective 7"" played at 78-- center around themes of childhood.

Futurismo,Kassin + 2,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5a39d034d5c69bf506f/1:1/w_160/035e7642.jpg,2008-05-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11392-futurismo/,Luaka Bop,"As yet another pop scion, Moreno Veloso's tread rather carefully on the coattails of his father Caetano. Veloso waited until just shy of his 30th birthday to release his debut Music Typewriter, and even then the 2000 disc was credited, modestly, to Moreno +2-- the ""+2"" of the equation being collaborators Alexandre Kassin and Domenico Lancelotti. In fact, espousing a sort of rotating auteur theory, the three have gone on to collaborate two more times, with each taking a turn as leader. Sincerely Hot, credited to Domenico +2, arrived in 2004, and now, following a protracted wait while U.S. label Luaka Bop searched for a distributor, comes Futurismo, credited to Kassin +2. Veloso, Lancelotti, and Kassin are all versatile multi-instrumentalists, and their respective roles change from disc to disc. Further belying any cries of ego, Veloso first ceded vocal duties to Domenico, and here, on the third volume of their collaborations, Veloso and Domenico largely let Kassin take the mic. The fact that each iteration of the band features the same performers but slightly different sounds is a credit to the group's collective creative vision, with each album offering a slightly different take on 21st century samba and bossa nova. No, this isn't your father's Brazilian pop, not even if your father is the famously freewheeling Caetano Veloso. In fact, even more than Moreno, Kassin has been around, working with everyone from Bebel Gilberto to Marisa Monte to Arto Lindsay, and appearing with what seems like about half of Brazil's musical community (his ""+2"" compatriots among them) in the supergroup Orquestra Imperial. Maybe those experiences explain why, despite the success of the Moreno and Domenico discs, Kassin's turn is nonetheless the strongest of the bunch. Then again, given that the group originally envisioned these albums (logically) as a trilogy, maybe Veloso, Lancelotti, and Kassin were just building up to Futurismo all along. With Futurismo, the gentler acoustic sounds of Moreno's disc and the slightly more electronic leaning experiments of Domenico meet in a completely entrancing middle. Not middle of the road, mind, but middle as in mesh, a mix of both extremes: traditional and outré, music meant for lounging on the beach, reclining with a drink, hitting the dance floor, and scaring the neighbors all wrapped in one. The space sounds and captured transmissions that conclude ""Seu Lugar"" don't knock it off its gentle path, but the jazzy funk of ""Esquecido"" isn't so passive. ""Pra Lembar"" and ""Mensagem"" are retro pop exotica, while ""Ponto Final"" rides a furious groove and menacing guitar riff into Tropicália nirvana. ""Samba Machine"" is a mix of fuzz rock and dance music, giving way to the breezy Afro-Caribbean beats of ""Agua"". ""Simbioticos"" is skittering indie rock. Speaking of indie, studio mainstays John McEntire and Sean O'Hagan crop up on Futurismo as well, fitting considering how much those two have borrowed from the MBP scene. Two of those three crossovers, ""Lakeline"" and ""Bow Road"", are sung in English, perhaps out of deference to his additional collaborators, perhaps a sign that Kassin is looking to spread his sonic adventures north of the border. In fact, whether chilling out or rocking out, Kassin would likely be welcomed enthusiastically were he to, say, tour North America more regularly, or even make more than the rare scattered appearance outside of Brazil. But as the myriad pleasures of Futurismo, like Sincerely Hot and Music Typewriter before it, demonstrate, what accounts for the appeal of the music is that no matter how far afield Kassin and crew go, it's Brazil and in particular the rhythms of Rio that remain foremost in their hearts. Moving away from those roots may potentially mean even greater fame, but what might get lost are the ineffable charms that draw listeners to gems like Futurismo in the first place.","The third part of a musical trilogy, Futurismo reunites collaborators Moreno Veloso, Alexandre Kassin, and Domenico Lancelotti in yet another permutation, this time with Kassin as leader.

"You're Never Alone with a Cigarette (Singles, Vol. 1)",Sun City Girls,by: Mike McGonigal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b59ec0084474cd0c2456/1:1/w_160/5ec8b2a8.jpg,2008-05-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11388-youre-never-alone-with-a-cigarette-singles-vol-1/,Abduction,"The music of the Sun City Girls (1981-2007) was a heady, diverse and lovingly fucked-up mixture of arcane musical styles. These trixters presaged entire genres before they existed. Their gamut swung from improv to cowboy ballads, South American folk songs to Asian drone music, crazy lounge songs to creepy classic rock, spaced-out jams to prank-ish punk. They were what happens when the melting pot explodes, miscegenation in every dimension. If that line sounds way too much like the voice-over from the trailer to a bad 1960s movie, all the better, as kitsch was among the more sharply burnished implements in their arsenal. Acts as diverse as Sunburned Hand of the Man, Thinking Fellers, Dengue Fever, Six Organs of Admittance, Camper van Beethoven, and Les Georges Leningrad owe more than a little to their margin-walking legacy. Each of their 80-or-so releases (including cassettes, LPs, CDs, singles, and one 10"" 78) was different, at times markedly so. There were no safety nets at their incredible performances. They often antagonized and taunted audiences-- in truth, they trusted the audience greatly, so much that they were never willing to pander in any way. Everything was done in their own idiosyncratic fashion. The band was largely ignored by critics. They occasionally received glowing reviews, notably from The Wire (from Ian Christe in 1995 and Erik Davis in 2004). Of course, it didn't help that the Girls rarely sent out promo copies, toured only sporadically, and released too many records at one time. Another reason the Girls were ""unsuccessful"" in terms of a career in underground rock is that they ignored the clamor to make more records like Torch of the Mystics (Majora, 1990). Torch is the thorny behemoth of the SCG discography. Otherworldly and melodic, it's undeniably among their best albums (and one of the ten best records of the 1980s, in my opinion). But the Girls made a dozen or two others that were of equal quality; they were simply more challenging listens. In time, the band would grow to dislike the record, and audience members' repeated suggestions to play songs from it would often be met with contemptuous stares and nicotine-fueled rants. The first release on the Sun City Girls' own Abduction imprint since the group disbanded at the start of 2007 following the untimely death of unhinged and brilliant percussionist/raconteur Charles Gocher is a wonderful visit to the group's archives. Named for a 7"" single of the same name, You're Never Alone with a Cigarette is a snapshot of the group in the late 1980s, right when they were reaching the peak of their powers. Six of the album's nine tracks were released on 7""s in the early 90s that you'd have to be some combination of lucky, old, and rich to already possess. And though the disc is on the short side at just under 40 minutes, the three previously unreleased tracks-- plus the expansion of ""The Fine-Tuned Machines of Lemuria"" from five to twelve minutes-- are sweet enough that SCG obsessives will be obliged to pick a copy. I should mention that longtime cohort Scott Colburn's remastering is astounding. Recorded in July 1988 at the same sessions as Torch of the Mystics, these predominantly instrumental surf, raga, free jazz, rock, and uncategorizable numbers were originally meant to round Torch out into a double album. Due to one label (Placebo) collapsing and the second label (Majora)'s lack of funds, that version never materialized, which is a real shame. It would have shown more of the group's full breadth, from the pretty, ""pan-Asian"" songs of Torch to the thorny, ragged post-psychedelia on display here. Word is that there are plans for this to be released on vinyl sometime soon. Perhaps it could include the long out-of-print Torch material as well-- pretty please, with one hundred pounds of black olives on top?","The cult band's best-known album, 1990's Torch of the Mystics, was originally intended to be a double; outtakes recorded during the sessions, eventually released on 7""s, are gathered together in this fine set.

Shallow Grave,The Tallest Man on Earth,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b58013d197565213ac93/1:1/w_160/731357be.jpg,2008-05-06 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11359-shallow-graves/,Gravitation,"Over the last half-century, the tag ""Dylanesque"" has been slapped on so many mediocre folksingers clutching battered Moleskines that it's become a meaningless joke, a critical hiccup, a silly, lazy way of invoking an age-old raspy voice/acoustic guitar combo. It's gotten so bad that, in 2008, yammering on about the cliché of dubbing someone ""the next Dylan"" has become a cliché in itself. Still: It's exceptionally hard to talk about Scandinavian folksinger the Tallest Man on Earth (also known as Kristian Matsson) without mentioning Bob Dylan's early years, mostly because Matsson manages to embody Dylan's effortlessness so well (Dylan was trying really, really hard, sure-- but he sang like he didn't give a shit), infusing his songs with a detachment that, miraculously, is neither cold nor alienating. Like Dylan, Matsson is so natural a songwriter that these tracks feel predetermined, tumbling out of his mouth with an ease and grace that's increasingly uncommon. Matsson released a self-titled five-song EP in 2007; Shallow Grave is his full-length debut. The production is appropriately scrappy, and it seems relatively safe to assume that the album was recorded live with one microphone-- accordingly, we hear the scratch of fingernails on string (and, on occasion, the chirping of birds in the background), made privy to each tiny exhalation and sigh. Matsson is an adept fingerpicker, and his guitar is easily as central as his voice, which is high, crackling, and rich. Much like Dylan himself, Matsson has mined the American south for inspiration, and his frantic strumming and front-porch poetry recall everyone from the Carter Family to Lead Belly to, most noticeably, country bluesman Mississippi John Hurt. ""The Blizzard's Never Seen the Desert Sands"" sees Matsson caw little poems (""And the bells up in the tower they will ring/ And the frightened little choirs they will sing/ They will tremble, all their voices"") over plucked banjo; ""The Gardener"" features a robustly strummed guitar melody and more half-cogent ideas (""I know the runner's gonna tell you/ There ain't no cowboy in my hair/ So now he's buried by the daisies/ So I can stay the tallest man in your eyes, babe""). Matsson's lyrics don't stand up as well on paper as they do in song (some have all the logic of fairy tales), but each of these cuts has a distinct, if muddled, narrative-- sparrows, tranquilizer guns, curtains, unicorns. Road stories, love stories, prayers. Matsson's melodies are remarkably pliant, and while it's understandable to be skeptical of another skinny dude with a mustache, a guitar, and a worn-out copy of The Anthology of American Folk Music, the more time you invest in Shallow Grave, the more you'll realize how unusually memorable it is. Ultimately, Shallow Grave transcends comparison-- which is saying an awful lot, given the popularity of its prototype-- and Matsson is a natural-born folksinger, earnest, clever, and comforting.","This Scandinavian folk singer embodies the (seemingly) breezy effortlessness of early Bob Dylan, infusing his songs with a detachment that, miraculously, is neither cold nor alienating.

Water Curses EP,Animal Collective,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b6015e6ef95969322884/1:1/w_160/47544243.jpg,2008-05-06 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11479-water-curses-ep/,Domino,"Animal Collective have followed each of their last three albums with a short companion EP closely related to its predecessor. 2005's Prospect Hummer echoed the bent acoustic folk-pop they'd explored on Campfire Songs and Sung Tongs; it also featured British folk legend Vashti Bunyan on vocals, who was then just returning to public consciousness. While Prospect sounded terrific from the start, 2006's People, which followed Feels, felt more like what it was-- a chance to release a few not-quite-as-good songs out that didn't make the cut. Now comes the Water Curses EP, which contains three tracks from the Strawberry Jam sessions and another recorded at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room studio. The opening title track ranks among the best songs the band has written in purely pop terms, alongside ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"", ""Grass"", and ""Fireworks"". The production is busy with snippets of what could be a gurgling bong, creaking floorboards, and laser-like effects, but it's mixed beautifully and remains light on the ears despite its density. With its de-emphasis on identifiable instrumentation (guitars are there, but they're way down in the mix), ""Water Curses"" seems unbound by genre or era, and serves as a nice reminder of how many risks Animal Collective is taking sonically these days. It's mostly electronic and it's pop, but it doesn't have anything to do with the 1980s, which in itself makes it unusual; it sounds like something no other band working right now could have made. Among the other three tracks, nothing else is nearly so direct melodically. ""Street Flash"", which has been a staple of live sets for a while now, begins slow with dubbed-out scraping noises and distant samples of loud vocalizations. The opening section is pure mood, as Avey Tare sings in his lower register to assorted sounds placed against a wide backdrop of silence, but then his voice is subjected to an underwater effect, some gentle piano enters, and things grow progressively thicker. The baby-like screams that he alternates with sweet crooning aren't going to win the band any new fans (they feel somewhat out of place in this more subtle track), but it's still an effective slice of ambience. ""Cobwebs"" is like a mid-tempo and more song-like variation on some of ""Street Flash""'s ideas; where the latter gets by on impressionistic drift, ""Cobwebs"" is like a slow march through a bucolic landscape, the clackity and deliberate percussion occasionally giving into a surging chorus. There's again plenty of intriguing sonic detail, and the track sounds especially good on headphones; with its bright, tactile production, the whole record is very visual, sometimes feeling like a series of weird scenes glimpsed through the glass of an aquarium. The aquatic motif returns on record closer ""Seal Eyeing"", which is anchored by a few notes of melancholy piano, and nicely wraps up some of the production ideas as they fold in the sound of the traditional instrument on a pretty, evocative ballad while maintaining an air of strangeness. Though ostensibly a collection of outtakes, Water Curses feels like its own thing, with a consistent mood and an identifiable palette. The record also finds the band becoming increasingly comfortable with integrating unusual sounds and textures into their music. Where they once used synths, delay pedals, and crude electronic percussion in an abstract, noise-oriented ways, they're now discovering how to make odd sounds work with proper songs. You can hear them becoming more experimental and more accessible simultaneously. While Water Curses is plenty enjoyable on its own, it also sets you dreaming about where Animal Collective will go next.","Animal Collective have followed each of their last three albums with a short companion EP closely related to its predecessor. Right on schedule, here's Water Curses, containing three tracks from the Strawberry Jam sessions and another recorded at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room studio.

Attack,Dead Child,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5b8ea9e61561daa6e54/1:1/w_160/08e7107f.jpg,2008-05-05 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11412-attack/,Quarterstick,"David Pajo's tenure in Slint is pretty unimpeachable. But after the tetchy brilliance of Spiderland, things get spotty. Sure, under various M banners, Pajo dabbles hush of folk to subtle effect. Albums like 2001's Whatever, Mortal were songwriting treats, music worthy of brushing elbows with the imposing stuff of his early days, no problem. But for every Live From a Shark Cage, there's a Mary Star of the Sea-- the catastrophic arena-ready byproduct of being an indie rock icon and cavorting with Billy Corgan. So it's fair to be skeptical of the metal band Pajo has scrounged up in Kentucky-- yes, Dead Child-- a cheesily reverent retread of 1980s-minded thrash, vintage hesher skuzz, yadda, yadda, yadda. And if that M.O. sounds familiar, it's because he already did it once with the initial touring incarnation of Early Man (remember them?). Just sub in an unfocused digest of Reagan-era metal in place of the downtown Matador metal dude's dead-on Metallica, and you're pretty much there. But while Early Man 100% deserved the down-the-nose ""hipster metal"" tag, Dead Child 100% doesn't. This stuff is bad without being ironic. Bad without being calculated. Bad because it just isn't any good. Yes, there are chops here. But save for a few mighty moments, they never get put to any interesting use. ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"" is all oom-pa drumming, tablature-dumb rock guitars, and high school battle of the bands solos. And the too-long-by-four-minutes ""The Coldest Hands"" forgets itself three or four times during its palm-muted sneeroffs. Jukeboxes do it better. The real issues, though, have nothing to do with the riffage. Pajo and Michael McMahan (of Slint reunion tour fame) play passably, if not inventively. Rather, it's the vocals and guitar tone that really head off Attack. Lead singer Dahm has a thin, nerve-wearing Geddy vs. Ozzy vs. Bruce tone, and the guitars have that blocky, rusted-out desert-rock tenor that works so well for Queens of the Stone Age but seems a bit lite when attempting to throw weight around like real thrash should. When you consider Slint's girth (Tweez was heavy!) and Pajo's oft-professed love of metal, the sound of this record is a real disappointment. On occasion, though, that love shines through. ""Rattlesnake Chalice"" works up a nice tension with its hourglass tom rolls and simple guitar figure. And ""Screaming Skull""'s tumble thunder riff is a structural beaut. Still, the fact remains: If it weren't for the famous guy in the band, we'd most likely ignore this record completely, saving space for anyone doing anything remotely creative with the same pedal-to-the-metal toolkit.","After an EP in early 2007, Attack is the debut full-length from Dave Pajo's Louisville-based metal band. His sincerity is not in question, but as to the quality of the music, well...

Great Plains,Head of Femur,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5709d034d5c69bf501d/1:1/w_160/46b2625f.jpg,2008-05-05 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11346-great-plains/,Greyday,"Head of Femur have never done small. The Chicago trio surrounds itself with crowds of other musicians in pursuit of a massive, orchestrated sonic bonanza, to the point where it feels faintly ridiculous to even think of them as a three-piece. Even the core trio has undergone changes-- founding member Ben Armstrong is now credited only as a songwriter-- but the basic sound is still intact, with Matt Focht and Mike Elsener trading off vocals and Chris Brickley and Dan Dietrich recording, with Omaha studio whiz AJ Mogis lending his hand on the final mix. I will say that they've pared back some from the gargantuan arrangements and piles of instruments that characterized their second album, 2005's Hysterical Stars. There are some surprisingly intimate moments on this record, most notably ""Covered Wagons"", which begins with nothing but vocals and piano before finally slipping into a string-drenched second half that nonetheless still manages to sound modest; it's the closest they've ever come to small. The song is almost five minutes old by the time Head of Femur get to the sweeping, jam-packed arrangement we're used to hearing from them. The decision to sharpen things and use the arrangements to emphasize certain passages, rather than hit you with constant overload, applies to much of the record. ""Jetway Junior"", ""Climbing Up Fire Escapes"", and ""River Ramble"" are all focused, relatively unadorned indie rock songs with sharp melodies and sharper tempos. ""River Ramble"" and ""Climbing Up Fire Escapes"" are both swimming with keyboards-- the former is practically electro-pop, with spiky synths and a pointillist bassline that precisely accents the drums. Even without total orchestral overload, they manage to make things sound big. ""Where's the Fire"" is a layer cake of horns, keyboards, busy guitars, and two-part vocal harmonies, and it's just as filling as the analogy suggests. ""Jetway Junior"" also sports strong harmony vocals, in a much more guitar-centric environment. It's the most straightforward indie rock song they've done, and one of their best. Head of Femur seem to have realized that less can be more, and in the process they've created a particularly dynamic and varied album. The band's basic sound hasn't changed much from record to record, but each has still felt like a distinct and different statement-- this one seems to be their step back from the excess they made their name on, but just a small one. Hysterical Stars is still my favorite, but Great Plains is nonetheless an excellent album that expands their range and shows us a more intimate side, if only for a moment.","Chicago band has pared back some from the gargantuan arrangements and piles of instruments that characterized its second album, 2005's Hysterical Stars, leading to some surprisingly intimate moments on their latest.

The Strangest Colored Lights,13ghosts,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5aa5e6ef959693227e3/1:1/w_160/89188f73.jpg,2008-05-05 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11399-the-strangest-colored-lights/,Skybucket,"The first track on 13ghosts' fourth album is called ""The Lonely Death of Space Avenger"", and, true to its title, it's a spare, lonesome space-folktale of an astronaut facing the void-- their own ""Space Oddity"". Death inhabits every corner of The Strangest Colored Lights, investing the Birmingham, Ala., band's pitch-dark songs with a Southern gothic ambience and, somewhat ironically, enlivening the music considerably. It's a very different album from Cicada in 2005, in which they stacked one idea atop another like junk-pile architecture, artfully arranging the raw materials to sound artless-- not composed and recorded, but unearthed in some kudzu gully, carted home, and propped up in the backyard. It's fire-and-brimstone Southern indie, delivered by two gritty singer-songwriters and apparently featuring every musician in Jefferson County. The Strangest Colored Lights lacks its predecessor's compelling chaos, but its songs are slightly more streamlined and fleshed out, their clear beginnings and endings recalling even earlier albums like 2002's Your Window Is Burning. One half of the songwriting team behind 13ghosts, Brad Armstrong sings like Richard Buckner at a closed-casket viewing and favors intensely Book of Revelations imagery. ""The wind will fall, and the blackbird will dance with the worm,"" he sings on ""Bury Me"" (perhaps an affirmative response to the old hymn ""Oh Bury Me Not""), between blasts of bluesy harmonica. ""The moon will call, and the black snake she swallows the world."" Rarely does indie rock examine decomposition, much less make it seem so mystical, like a new trickster mythology. By contrast, Buzz Russell's drawl sounds slightly more commonplace, although more conspiratorial in its tone, as if he's singing to an audience rather than to the firmament. Against guitars that alternate between dreamy and abrasive, ""Faint Goat"" portrays a high school outsider, a kind of Weird Harold who's good at poetry and ballet, but forgoes sympathy for tauntingly brutal honesty: ""Hey faint goat, where's your nanny now? Were you left here to save the world?"" Together, Armstrong and Russell form a sort of deep-fried Gutter Twins, and their obsession with mortality makes them musically omnivorous, as if they must digest as much as possible in their allotted time on Earth. As a result, 13ghosts continue to reinvent themselves with every song, trying on new sounds and styles to see what fits. Russell's ""Riverside"" rumbles with Carnival of Souls organ, then erupts with funereal horns and Morricone guitar, like Calexico playing a New Orleans funeral. ""Go to Sleep"" trips along on a modified reggae rhythm, while a drum machine cajoles the subdued ""Whip Poor Will"". Armstrong's ""Soon When I'm Gone"" rewrites a Gram Parsons ballad as deathbed transference: ""I hear the clatter of the beetle as she waits for me to tire,"" Armstrong sings, as if absorbing into the cosmos, the songs swirling psychedelically around him. ""I hear the breathing of the earthworm as she crawls a ragged mile. The Strangest Colored Lights ends not with the George Harrison-style finale of ""Transmissions"", as the tracklist indicates, but with an untitled hidden track that features Armstrong singing about fictional artists who never showed their work. One sings her songs into a jar, which she buries deep in the earth; another has his poems eaten by foxes. Despite being locked in the basement of the album, the song reveals 13ghosts' true concerns: Can making art make them immortal? Ultimately, all this talk of death might be too much too bear were it not for the range of sounds swirling around it: The Strangest Colored Lights is a persistently somber, mostly humorless album, but it's so musically vigorous that you wouldn't mind if they dwelt on death for the rest of their lives.","The two songwriters in this Birmingham, Ala., band come over like deep-fried Gutter Twins, and their obsession with mortality makes them musically omnivorous, as if they must digest as much as possible in their allotted time on Earth.

EP / Live/Acoustic,Blitzen Trapper,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14213d19756521385ab/1:1/w_160/06066152.gif,2008-05-05 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11670-ep-liveacoustic/,self-released,"While the Blitzen Trapper machine continues to tour the country, new songs fall from it like rusted mufflers; their merch table must look like a neglected pawn shop to those who haven't been following closely. Though there have been one-off singles, multiple Daytrotter sessions, and scads of unreleased material before it, the self-pressed tour release EP includes some would-be singles nearly on par with the their breakthrough Wild Mountain Nation. Though the songs cover familiar ground, among the more arresting sidesteps is ""Shoulder Full of You"", a placid country ballad that leans heavily on slow acoustic plucking and singer Eric Earley's nature-heavy lyrics, though he uses his most surprising image twice (""Deer tracks on an unmade bed"") and pairs ""miss you"" with ""kiss you""; the words seem like placeholders on a track that would otherwise be a promising slow jam for the band. The rest of the EP's tracks are more typical of the band, with affable melodies that flirt with country as they amble towards circuitous choruses, all brushed with a modern feel by touches like the Moogs in ""Going Down"" and ""Preacher's Sister's Boy"". If they feel like a step back from the studiously ADD Nation, well, some of them quite literally are: Even as it gets a spot on both EPs, ""Silver Moon"" is actually a leftover from the band's scrapped, pre-Nation attempt at recording their third album. (These tracks made the rounds at various blogs at the time, and are likely still floating around online.) This newer version hasn't changed much aside from being a little more lo-fi and comfortable than its studio-bred counterpart. Fans who grab this EP on the band's tour won't be disappointed with these songs, but they're more like a bridge between the band's second and third record than any kind of step forward. More revealing is the small sampling of tracks Blitzen Trapper have quietly released on iTunes as Live/Acoustic. For all of BT's mercurial rock moves, there's almost another band entirely working underneath here, one that opens their sets with bluegrass traditionals and whose reference points reach back farther than their parent's Neil Young records. Earley's father himself was a bluegrass musician (actual recordings of James Earley can be found on the band's second album, Field Rexx), and when the band explores these roots, they play with a depth and authority that belies the scattershot nature of their albums. The fleet finger-picking of ""Shady Grove"", an unaccompanied piece with just Earley and guitar that has opened some of the band's shows, has an accomplished and uncanny twang. A cover of Tom Paxton's ""The Last Thing on My Mind"" is ever better for the harmonies (and harmonica), and new track ""Going Wrong"" takes normally quirky textures like jaw harp and slide guitar and twists them into deep-space melancholy. But previously released tracks ""Silver Moon"" and ""Wild Mountain Nation"" bow and sag under their own wistfulness without the full band-- lacking the proud guitar-string bends that open ""Nation"" in particular just seems wrong somehow. It doesn't take three versions of ""Silver Moon"" to see how the band takes the seeds of Earley's melodies and runs through as many incarnations as they can come up with-- they're all distinctive, but none are quite a moment of epiphany like, say, the version of ""Jericho"" from the band's first Daytrotter session. Even tireless revision doesn't guarantee transcendent results, but it's good to see the band's many rough drafts. While the grab-bag excitement of Wild Mountain Nation was highly contagious, it would be great to hear the band dig in and play to these untapped strengths...provided they haven't written and recorded their follow-up already.",,7.0,
Nouns,No Age,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5e2b1335d7bf169a987/1:1/w_160/a399f141.jpg,2008-05-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11449-nouns/,Sub Pop,"It's disingenuous to talk about Los Angeles' New Yorker-profiled, vegan-snacks-serving, book-lending, all-ages venue the Smell with the same high-art vocabulary you'd use to dissect other creative collectives, like Andy Warhol's Factory-- the Smell's constituency (L.A.'s optimistic experimental art pack) appears un-fixated on fame, self-aggrandizement, or furthering its nascent mythology. To an outsider, the Smell is idealistic and romantic, a stroller-friendly, cheap-haircut-hocking haven that's as functional as it is fruitful. Save Baltimore's Wham City, it's been a while since American music fans have had a similar hometown scene to get riled up about; regional culture has been fractured and marginalized by the internet, and being too focused on anything local-- except produce, maybe-- feels depressingly provincial in 2008. Consequently, it's weirdly thrilling that a community-sponsored, community-supported art space can attract (and sustain) such a horde of admirable bands. No Age, along with Mika Miko, Abe Vigoda, Lavender Diamond, BARR, and a handful of others, are mainstays at the Smell; the cover of No Age's 2007 EP compilation, Weirdo Rippers, famously features the exterior of the club, and guitarist Randy Randall reportedly helped mine trenches in the venue's concrete floor so that a second bathroom could be installed to accommodate new crowds. Given the critical success of Weirdo Rippers, No Age's scope has now expanded well beyond Los Angeles, and Nouns, their first full-length, is appropriately ambitious. A guitar/drums duo (Randall and drummer/vocalist Dean Spunt) with a penchant for self-recorded samples, No Age are mostly unconcerned with things like space or pause, and Nouns is gorgeously thick-- a hazy, delirious expanse that's both comforting and disorienting. Opener ""Miner"" begins and ends in murk, and in between Randall and Spunt sputter and twitch and pound, alternately revealing and concealing a sweet, taut melody-- such is No Age's agenda, burying an addictive little singalong in layers of effects and fuzz. ""Eraser"" is more immediately user-friendly, opening with sunny guitar chirps and a knee-slapping drumbeat, before Spunt starts barking intelligible lyrics (""Wait for the foreman now get paid/ Wait and see the list of shit you made"") and the music goes steady and frantic. ""Eraser"" is a summer song in the sweatiest, most realistic sense-- it's not the Beach Boys' gooey, über-idealized, convertibles-and-beach-volleyball version, it's the waiting-for-the-bus, sweaty and desperate but still-sorta-excited-about-all-that-sunshine take. ""Here Should Be My Home"" is similarly exuberant, full of power chords and distortion; it's arguably the poppiest thing No Age have recorded to date (all those cries of ""baby"" are practically bubblegum), and accordingly, completely addictive. ""Sleeper Hold"", meanwhile, is the sound-- both literally and metaphysically-- of everything happening all at once, an ecstatic, feedback-addled lullaby. Some fans might pine-- at least at first-- for the (vaguely) more experimental, less riff-driven muck of Weirdo Rippers, but Nouns is a more thoughtful, coherent (and still plenty dirty) version of what No Age began building with all those EPs. Listening to Nouns, it's hard to comprehend how just two people can manage to make so much noise while still sounding so subdued and mysterious-- it's easier to imagine Randall and Spunt spewing these songs underwater, bursting forth from some colossal California quarry rather than a tiny, stuffy art space a few blocks from L.A.'s skid row. Nouns is so cacophonous, so fertile, and so ripe with sound that parsing out the samples and effects and various layers of guitar is nearly impossible; besides, it's way more satisfying to just close your eyes and just enjoy it. Ultimately, it's part of No Age's allure that Nouns is so difficult to figure out, that it manages to be so big while coming from a place so small: All you'll know for sure is that you want to listen longer. Maybe forever.","No Age follow their 2007 EP compilation, Weirdo Rippers, with an ambitious Sub Pop debut: Nouns is gorgeously thick-- a hazy, delirious expanse that's friendly and warm and, best of all, unpredictable.

Fabric 39,Robert Hood,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5efb1335d7bf169a99c/1:1/w_160/0b663d2f.jpg,2008-05-02 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11461-fabric-39/,Fabric,"I couldn't sleep, so I crept downstairs and turned on the TV, only to be confronted by Gregg Araki's 1992 film The Living End. The suicidal, sadomasochistic gay love-death pact the film details was suitably confronting for my fragile fourteen-year-old mind, but really what stayed with me later were images of cars speeding through underpasses at night, and telephone conversations in darkened rooms, all to the soundtrack of cold, nihilistic computer music. Surely, I thought to myself, this was the future. Later on, the actual soundtrack of The Living End-- all snarky late-eighties industrial-rock-- struggled to convincingly stand in for the future for me. But if I want to recreate the way that music felt to me at the time, it's hard to look past the cold delirium futurism of hard-as-nails techno. One can draw here a slight, vague distinction between the future and the futuristic: Robert Hood's style doesn't sound avant in the ""How'd they do that?"" sense (for that, the best candidate remains the more fractured end of drum & bass), but in its scorched-earth stance towards traditional notions of musicality-- it's less about the profundity (or even proficiency) of technology than the absence of humanity. Like a city carved into the face of a cliff, Hood's brand of techno is defined by the ever-present threat of its harder-faster-stronger impulse tumbling over into outright mindlessness. Of course, one can question this idea of a line beyond which the mind stops, where all that is left is compulsive somatic jerking. And yet, the music itself sounds like it believes in such a brink, and the sense of inhuman restraint required to stop just short of it is integral to its appeal. For those who have become properly acquainted with dance music only during this decade, the operating principles of Hood's new DJ mix for the Fabric series may seem foreign, even alien: most tracks eschew the recent vogue for narrative development in favor of a near-static loopiness. Narrative is instead provided by Hood's relentless mixing, racing through thirty-two tracks (double the current standard amount) in less than eighty minutes. So it's not surprising that the mix covers a lot of ground, even when at times it can seem to barely change from one track to the next. The easiest to like (and probably my favorite) parts of Fabric 39 are those which unabashedly embrace the chilly dawn of the post-human, their riotous detail suggesting that something definitely survives beyond us. I'm thinking of the bleepy propulsion of Hood's own ""Element 9"" and especially ""Who Taught You Math"", all darting deliquescing synth patterns -- Detroit techno with all the nebulous ""soul"" replaced by the frenzied activity of hive-building insects-- or ""And Then We Planned Our Escape"", with its cavernous dub echo and scintillating textures. At the opposite end of the spectrum are a selection of tuff (not tough), lightning speed filter-disco productions reminiscent of Derrick May's Mayday mix. These tracks are ""post-human"" only in the strict science fiction sense, their pleasure-centered muscularity close enough to our own enjoyment to suggest, not our obsolescence, but where our desires might take us in the future. In between is a swathe of sternly self-censoring machine-music whose appeal is a little less self-evident. The old line that ""you've got to dance to this in a club to truly understand it"" gets wheeled out a little too often for my liking, but it holds true to this extent at least: The lessons of this music are learnt by the body first, and the mind cracks their method only belatedly. Unless you can imagine dancing to Adam Beyer's remix of UK Gold's ""Agent Wood"", its strobing, scraping percussive riffs will hold no meaning, will seem to be merely arbitrary arrangements of noise around a dictatorial beat. However, while the enthusiasts may disagree, from my relatively uninformed perspective there is a line beyond which this music does start to resemble the pointless pound of its detractors' strawman imaginings. It's difficult, for example, to see much to like about the murky thud of Mion's ""Drop The Filter"" or Pacou's ""X-Factor"". Where is that line? It's easier to point to examples falling on either side, and thrill to the minimalist but irresistible funk of Hood's ""School"" with its compressed syncopated riffs and distorted vocal samples. You can't move to this groove like you can with house music: at such a blistering tempo, you're locked into the controlling stomp of the kick drum. But your body can register the difference between that stomp and the counter-grooves that ripple across it, such that the arrangement sheds its monolithic appearance, replaced by a deeply satisfying, tense elasticity. Pacou-style techno (and I admit that we're now dealing with incredibly fine distinctions, but bear with me) works by eliminating all but the barest traces or echoes of multivalence in the groove, which remains as a mere hope or possibility that the body stubbornly clings to. This makes a little more sense in theory than in practice, taking the inherent tension of this music to a logical extreme that becomes a vanishing point, all but indistinguishable from a joyless thump. On the other hand, the emergence out of such dark stretches can be thrilling in practice fully as much as theory, such as when Pacou's ""All It Takes"" (not very much presumably being his point) gives way to the flashing hi-hats and rising synth paranoia of Phase's ""Mass"". Anyway, vanishing points are by definition a matter of perspective, and maybe the only difference between me and the real enthusiast is that their focus has been shifted so as to see even further down that infinitely receding tunnel. One can only guess at what spells of privation would be required to reach such a state; thankfully for the rest of us, Fabric 39 rarely demands it, and I have to assume that, if faced with the joyous robo-salsa assault of Los Hermanos' remix of Hood's ""Still Here"", the hardened veteran would succumb as quickly and as easily as I do.","Detroit techno giant offers up relentless Fabric mix that races through 32 tracks in less than 80 minutes.

Yeti #5,Various Artists,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5ee5e6ef95969322864/1:1/w_160/ab110a0d.jpg,2008-05-02 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11460-yeti-5/,Unknown,"Mixtapes are assembled for the gratification of their creators, not their recipients. Obviously, I'm not the first to say it, but seeing how Muxtape has become the spring's hottest, most annoying internet music fad, perhaps it bears repeating. As Eric Harvey has previously argued on this site, most amateur tastemaking exercises serve social rather than critical functions; they're performances of taste, but don't in any serious way threaten authoritative or professional opinions. In other words, we still need expert compilers like Harry Smith-- enthusiasts who also happen to have extraordinary ears and the knowledge and ability to make sense of their curatorial impulses. Yeti compilations, of course, aren't just expert mixtapes. Integral to the intermittently published Portland-based arts magazine, the enclosed CD converses with Yeti's text-- criticism, fiction, interviews-- and its visual art. Issue #5's three closing tracks, for example, illustrate editor (and Pitchfork contributor) Mike McGonigal's piece on early gospel bluesman Blind Willie Johnson's ""Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground"". The relatively brief, but vigorous and personal essay maps the 1927 recording in the context of prevailing musical and religious currents. And when you hear its sublime penumbral moan and ghostly slide guitar, you'll understand why ""Dark"" is worthy of close musicological reading. But for my money, A.C. and Blind Mamie Forehand's ""Honey in the Rock"" is the Yeti #5 track worth the price of admission. In email conversation, McGonigal described it as ""not only one of the most amazing songs of the last hundred years but... a total square one song"", and I heartily cosign. If nothing else, it makes one of the most astonishing uses of a found object-turned-instrument: the lowly service bell. Music fans who aren't already regular Yeti readers (or devotees of McGonigal's old zine Chemical Imbalance) probably won't buy this volume for its fantastic blues and gospel cuts, Scott Seward's history of folk-metal, or Justin Taylor's Will Oldham interview, but for the four songs (and pen and ink illustration) submitted by some guy named Jeff Mangum. If you're one of the legions who's been stalking Mangum since Neutral Milk Hotel's late-1990s dissolution, these old 78s won't come as much of a surprise. The two cuts by Greek folk singer Marika Papagika sound like shortwave transmissions from a century-lost world, her grave and luminous voice streaking like weak winter sunlight through a crust of hiss and pops. A choral rendition of traditional Georgian (as in Russian) folk song ""Suliko"" is lovely, if unremarkable, and not as exciting as the fourth track-- an unidentified waltz that's probably Asian, most likely 30s, and definitely haunting. Fed with tomatoes and radio wire indeed. The disc also makes room for a fistful of live and previously unreleased tracks that land a little more squarely in the average indie rock listener's comfort zone: Dean & Britta performing ""Tugboat"", a pair of dispatches from Phil Elverum's camp, and tracks from Akron/Family, Atlas Sound, and Iron & Wine. Fortunately, the musically voracious McGonigal has some practice mixing songs of wildly divergent genres, styles, and recording quality, so that the honey-harmonied Anglin Brothers' track rolls more gently into the squeal and squawk of Deerhoof's ""Forbidden Fruits"" than you'd ever think possible. If anything doesn't quite work, it's the Radio Sumatra outtakes scattered throughout. While intellectually intriguing, these sound collages are also sonically punishing and wear out their welcome long before their fourth bow. Then again, good mixtapes should challenge listeners, introduce them to unfamiliar sounds that enable them to hear familiar ones differently and, if the mix is really great, whet an appetite for exploration into deeper corners of the musical universe. And before you ask: no, I don't want to hear your Muxtape.","CD included with arts and culture zine functions like a good mixtape, moving from live and unreleased tracks by Dean & Britta, Akron/Family, and Atlas Sound to rare 78s selected by Jeff Mangum.

"When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold",Atmosphere,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f9c0084474cd0c24ef/1:1/w_160/f4fdd2b0.jpg,2008-05-02 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11471-when-life-gives-you-lemons-you-paint-that-shit-gold/,Rhymesayers,"Drug addiction is bad, but drama addiction might be worse. That is the lesson of ""Shoulda Known"", Atmosphere's salvo at that stock character, the enabler. Taken from Minneapolis duo's fifth studio album, When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold, the song is more dramatic monologue than soliloquy-- one of those rare moments when Slug isn't plumbing the depths of his favorite subject, Slug. (Watching the video for ""Shoulda Known"", you might gather that Slug's new subject is soon-to-be-rescued American Apparel models.) Even the album's title-- judged against their college-rap classics Overcast and Lucy Ford-- hints that this outing may be less, well, narcissistically emo. Could Atmosphere's sad-clown era really be over? Slug's lyrics, it turns out, are refreshingly mundane. When Life Gives You Lemons comes off not so much as a memoir of a bohemian artist, but as an old liberal's debut short-story collection. It isn't as dull as it sounds. The enabler is one of many resolutely unglamorous figures here, joining a procession of rust-belt standbys-- late-shift waitress, warehouse worker, deadbeat dad, homeless man, Tom Waits-- straight out of Studs Terkel. It's a noble idea, but it doesn't quite suit Slug's talents, which can veer, in typical backpacker fashion, toward the didactic and sentimental. Even so, it is a welcome leap for the MC to step out of his turbulent inner life and into the shoes of unsung-- at least, unrapped-- working-class men and women. Producer Ant isn't retracing old paths either-- though he finds more success than his partner. He sets ""Shoulda Known"", for instance, above synthetic handclaps and a glum, coldly fuzzed bass that, together, seem like the embryo of a Justin Timberlake track, before the star's producers add the de rigueur layers and velocity. It's a far cry from the humbly retro collage of samples that grounded Ant's signature sound in the past-- and it works. In a marriage of live instrumentation and vintage analog synths, Ant finds a new way to build set pieces for Slug's tortured narratives. Take the soulfully cheesy, ersatz-Gnarls Barkley ""You"", for instance. Sticking to the second-person perspective, and unburdened by the gnawed-to-oblivion themes of drug abuse, ""You"" could have been a strong lead single. Everyone knows about the needle and the damage done; the question forgotten by too many songwriters, faithfully remembered here, is how ordinary folks make it through the day and make ends meet. Along the same lines, at the heart of ""Dreamer"" and ""Guarantees"" are families trying to get by in a broken, dead-end economy. Obviously the trials of parenthood, not exactly a staple on DJ playlists, loom large in Slug's visions of 9-to-5 life. Lyrically, like the songs in between, those that bookend When Life Gives You Lemons are adventurous precisely because they're not adventurous, not spectacular, not sensational. ""Like the Rest of Us"" introduces the album with a sleepy melody from a child's music box. The song proceeds with a loop of smoky-nightclub pianos, a plaintive backdrop for Slug's smooth whispers about mothers-to-be and casual cocaine users. But a brighter, faster music box gives the album's closer, ""In Her Music Box"", a vibe that is wrier and angrier, perfect for a song about the R-rated nihilism streaming out of parents' car radios. The thread that runs from the first song to the last is a warm sympathy for working-class heroes and antiheroes-- especially the ones trying raise kids. More energy and less uniformly drab scenery might have kept these well-intentioned stories from blurring into each other. One that stands apart is the mainstream-aimed ""Guarantees"", which treads dangerously close to mall-core. Too often the duo's slow, spartan approach just assures that songs like ""Your Glasshouse"" and ""The Skinny"" never leave the ground. And the middling tempos are only partly to blame. ""Wild Wild Horses"" leans on a metaphor that, let's face it, will never be pried from the Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers. That said, When Life Gives You Lemons still helps lift Atmosphere further out of indie-rap territory. The shaggy-dog narratives of ordinary people buffeted by everyday tragedies are still rare outside the genre, despite rap's origins in exactly that hue of storytelling. So even when Slug gives in to his inner corniness, we let him off the hook. Granted, the production makes the naturalism pill easier to swallow. Open-minded fans will thank Ant, whose piano-driven works (""Yesterday"", the opening two tracks) and darkly pretty ""Painting"" reveal a mind keeping up with his partner's, amplifying and deepening and, in his phrase, Quincy-Jonesing the record's vistas of blue-collar melancholia.","The Minneapolis duo's surprise hit album finds them less narcissistically emo than on previous efforts; rather than himself, Slug explores a procession of rust-belt standbys-- late-shift waitress, warehouse worker, deadbeat dad, homeless man, Tom Waits-- straight out of Studs Terkel.

What We Did on Our Holidays / Unhalfbricking,Fairport Convention,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5b69d034d5c69bf5089/1:1/w_160/bb50de5b.jpg,2008-05-02 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11674-what-we-did-on-our-holidays-unhalfbricking/,HannibalHannibal,"Fairport Convention are commonly considered to be the first British folk-rock group, which is essentially true even if it doesn't really count for much. Releasing their self-titled debut in 1967, they drew heavily the Byrds, Joni Mitchell, Jefferson Airplane, and especially Bob Dylan, but they weren't merely aping an American trend. Instead, the band mingled those jangly Yankee innovations with British folk traditions, rearranging and exploding old ballads and jigs into crisp new rock songs. The results, as early as their second album, were fairly distinctive, although Fairport Convention (which was named after the house where the band held its first practices) were often mistaken for an American band. At the time, most of the members were in their late teens or early twenties, yet for all the spiritedness of their music, they sound today much older than their years: Vocalist Sandy Denny, who defected from the Strawbs to replace Judy Dyble, possesses a dramatic, soulful voice, while Richard Thompson is impossibly dexterous, tossing out curlicue riffs with a professional's casual precision. Fairport Convention, of course, had better luck in their homeland than they did in the U.S., to the extent that many of their most popular albums are available only as imports. Righting two wrongs at once, Water Records has reissued the band's second and third albums, What We Did on Our Holidays and Unhalfbricking, both from 1969, and both previously unavailable in America. Legendary producer Joe Boyd oversaw both records, lending them a live sound that complements the musicians' youthful vigor. Generally, these two albums are considered somewhat transitional for the band, gradually tracking the decrease in American influences and the increase in British, all leading up to their biggest album, Liege & Lief. However, neither is a minor album in the Fairport Convention catalog. Heard back to back, they give the impression of a confident band growing even more confident-- almost cocky at times-- as they continue to fine-tune their already complex transatlantic sound. What We Did on Our Holidays begins with Denny's ""Fotheringay"", which takes its name from the castle where Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned and which sounds like it could be attributed to Traditional. Moreover, it's our introduction to Denny's robust, expressive voice, which gives the band new and considerable power, whether she's humming ""The Lord Is in This Place, How Dreadful Is This Place"", or exerting inhuman control on ""She Moves Through the Fair"". The album mixes new interpretations of traditional ballads like ""Nottamun Town"", here rendered almost as a raga, with much newer songs, such as their soulful take on Dylan's ""I'll Keep It With Mine"" and their ponderous version of Mitchell's ""Eastern Rain"". The best material on Holidays, though, may be their own-- the stomping blues-rock of ""Mr. Lacey"", the racing ""No Man's Land"", and the stirring afterlife anthem ""Meet on the Ledge"". Instead of jettisoning their borrowed American traits on Unhalfbricking, Fairport Convention find new ways to upend them, as on their playful zydeco-flavored reading of Dylan's ""Si Tu Dois Partir"" (you may know it as ""If You Gotta Go, Go Now"") and their own ""Cajun Woman"", a bracing amalgam of Cajun rhythms, surf melodies, and Beach Boys orchestrations. On ""Sailor's Life"", they turn an old British lament into an eleven-minute jam, showing off the group's improvisational dynamic and Thompson's considerable soloing skills. In the liners for these new reissues, M.C. Taylor calls it ""their own singular form of British country music."" Their cover of Dylan's obscure ""Percy's Song"" takes that idea one step further: The tale of a wrongly imprisoned man, it's not dissimilar to those told by Johnny Cash or Merle Haggard at the same time, yet they make it sound distinctively British and distinctively Fairport Convention. The band build to an intense finale, as Denny sounds more bruised yet more steadfast with each repetition of the refrain ""Turn, turn to the rain and the wind."" More than anything else, Unhalfbricking-- and, to a lesser extent, Holidays-- conveys the band's simple excitement at making music, culminating in their giddy cover of ""Million Dollar Bash"". They trade off vocals and generally egg each other on, creating a joyful ending to the first chapter of their long career.","Reissue of two albums from 1969 finds the British folk-rock band that then included Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny in transitional mode, as it gradually sheds American influences and further embraces British folk traditions.

Smile,Boris,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bf9d034d5c69bf2a20/1:1/w_160/a84935d7.jpg,2008-05-02 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11464-smile/,Diwphalanx,"Boris' affinity for every variety of psychedelia has been unending, so it's no surprise they finally went and named a record Smile. They do so after a run of releases that's included hard noise freakouts (Sun Baked Snow Cave, with Merzbow), drug-caked and deadpan Motörhead take-offs (Pink), tepid five-blunt solos [Altar, with SunnO)))], and psych-sessions with Ghost's Michio Kurihara (Rainbow). Most of these recordings came in at least two versions-- Japanese, American, vinyl, CD, smoke signal, etc.-- and, in the case of Dronevil Final, a one stereophonic, two-soundsystem-requiring CD set. If you claim to like everything Boris have done in their decade-plus run, let alone in the past three years, your tolerance for directionless, shapeless, and unending jam sessions is higher than mine. My guess is the band probably doesn't lose much sleep over the quality or consistency of what they put out, but it was still dispiriting to hear Boris's Atsuo run down Pink in recent interviews. He now refers to the band's ""cool rock"" phase as boring, which is what I'd call the instrumental noise'n'drone suites the band drops on a maddeningly regular basis. No matter: the scuffed-up, scuzzed-out Pink will be their monument, whether they like it or not. Discovering what you're best at would be a thrill to most bands, but to Boris, it apparently felt like a burden, and so Smile is their exquisite-corpse sequel, a near-automatic exercise in drawing inspiration from anybody but themselves. For the Japanese version, the trio went so far as to leave the record behind with engineer and veteran of the Stars You Ishihara, who mixed and mastered it while the band was out of town. Among those Smile nods toward: The U.S. version opens with a cover of a song by Kenji Sawada, of Pyg/Julie-renown; ""Buzz-In"" is named for the Melvins; another track, apparently, cops lyrics from Japanese band Anthem. A friend by the name of Aso wrote the excellently titled ""You Were Holding An Umbrella"", while Sunn0)))'s Stephen O'Malley plays on the record's final song. Kurihara guests throughout. The Japanese version could credibly have Ishihara's name on the cover, since his demented, scooped-out mixes bear little similarity to what Boris will call Smile in the U.S. There are, as expected, sublime moments on both, but it also seems as if these songs were simply the first eight that the prolific band wrote between one tour and the next. A band named after a Melvins track wouldn't title a song ""Buzz-In"" lightly, and Boris' tribute begins with a squealing baby, who sings a little bit before the guitars ramp up. After that, the band charges in at its usual half-stoned, half-time boogie. That swagger-- playing from behind the beat-- is likely what's on Atsuo's mind when he talks about ""cool rock,"" which ""Buzz-In"" most assuredly is; why anyone would avoid howling over guitars as finely distorted and oil-slicked as these is anyone's guess. ""Laser Beam"", a whisky-throated, spread-legs titan, dips so low in scuzz and feedback it could be a broken practice-session rehearsal, before a typically Boris pivot: The sound of a computer turning off or on, followed by the emphatically blank return of Takeshi's deadpan vocals. Veering into satire (welcome, for a band who appear to have no sense of humor beyond the name of their label/design firm, Fangs Anal Satan) is ""Statement"", on which the band breaks out both a cowbell and the ""woo-woo"" from ""Sympathy for the Devil"". ""My Neighbor Satan"" is one of those Boris warblers-- like Akuma no Uta's ""Nothingness Song"", say-- that sounds like it was written, mid voice-crack, by a 16-year-old boy. The untitled finale is an O'Malley collaboration, plus another shot at breaking out the wail, here mitigated by the droning weight of O'Malley's Stonehenge backline. Those in the market for something truly unfathomable should seek out Smile's Japanese version. Beyond an entertainingly hollowed out ""Statement"", Ishihara leaves most of the other instrument sounds untreated-- all the better to scrape off your skin. This swarm-of-hornets sound suits a band that consistently hesitates just at it appears ready to turn loose. I also prefer Isihara's version of ""No Ones Grieve"", a The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked 2 outtake, which here dispenses with the ceremonial marching of the U.S. version for an undifferentiated, Comets on Fire feedback spray. It takes a few listens just to sort out which song is which relative to the U.S. version. ""My Neighbor Satan""-- subdued, crooning-- becomes, on the Japanese version, thick, layered: a Justin Broderick outtake, drenched in JAMC fuzz. The O'Malley duet, which ends both versions, is a noisier, more guitar-hero affair via Ishihara, whose instinct is to consistently pull out both extremes (melody, solo-y chaos) in the band's sound. It's a creative way of bluffing some unity from the record. Boris are clearly proud to have made a record as schizophrenic as Smile, and I have no doubt their method helped them see all sorts of colors while making it. But the band may consider their fellow countrymen, Acid Mothers Temple, whose propensity to make ideally psychedelic but for all purposes identical records has, over time, sucked the surprise out of their ostensibly free-form vortex. It's no crime to make the same record twice when the alternative is making a different one, over and over and over again.",,6.4,
¡Sonido Amazonico!,Chicha Libre,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5a9ea9e61561daa6e3d/1:1/w_160/1a25cda8.jpg,2008-05-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11398-sonido-amazonico/,Barbès,"Chicha Libre is an anomaly, a modern American band playing a kind of music that was popular among the working classes of northern Peru in the 1960s and 70s. If the style of music they play were a star, they would be a planet that arrived to orbit it decades after it faded out. It's a phenomenon that's grown in the last ten years: Western bands building their music on an obscure, vaguely familiar blueprint from outside their own culture. There are scores of North American and European Afrobeat bands, and Dengue Fever pattern themselves on Cambodian garage rock. It's cultural imperialism in reverse; these bands embrace the sometimes-unexpected way in which musicians in other countries interpreted our own music and use it as inspiration. That Chicha Libre's debut album is out on Barbés Records makes sense. It's the label, after all, that last year released the excellent Roots of Chicha compilation, a disc that highlighted the chicha music of Amazonian Peru. Like Tropicália, soukous, and reggae, Chicha was a syncretic pop style, built on the back of the Colombian cumbia, a dance form with roots in West Africa. Chicha musicians used the cumbia's rhythmic foundation, underpinning their songs with congas, shakers, and claves, but replaced the traditional acoustic guitars and accordions with electric guitars, basses, and Farfisa organs. They also grafted on the pentatonic scales of traditional Andean and Amazonian music and incorporated elements of Cuban and American pop, especially surf guitar music. The result of all this blending was something totally original and distinctive. It became the soundtrack to the sudden urbanization of far inland Peru, as the mid-60s oil boom swept across the country's rugged and vast Loreto region. In cities like Iquitos, which rests on the bank of the Amazon, it was a thrilling new thing to dance to, quite unlike anything available before it. And because surf music itself was syncretic, borrowing melodies and pentatonic scales from Greece and Middle East, it fit right in as an element of the new sound. The name comes from a Latin American equivalent of a microbrew-- chicha is a family of fermented beverages made of widely varied base ingredients in Central and South America. In northern Peru, the word was also uniquely used to describe the transient lifestyle of temporary workers. Chicha eventually spread all the way to Lima on the coast, but never gained wide notoriety, in part because of its low-class origins. Even most compilations of Peruvian rock music leave it out in favor of garage bands like Los Yorks and Anglicized psych bands like We All Together (both of which are great, nonetheless). Something so powerful had to come back to the surface eventually, though, and now that it has, Chicha Libre is there to breathe some new life into it, taking the sound back to its roots (modern chicha groups tend to sound pretty different from their forebears, using digital synths and drum machines) while adding a few of their own touches. ¡Sonido Amazonico! takes its title from a stunning psychedelic surf instrumental by Los Mirlos, one of the best and most vital chicha bands. A faithful and great cover of that song leads of the album, immediately grasping the humid vibe that makes old-time chicha so arresting. The psychedelic organ solo is fantastic. The members don't exactly have Latino names-- Burrows, Camp, Conan, Cudahy, Douglas, and Quigley-- but they do sing in Spanish (quite competently), and they approach the music with genuine affection but not so much that they're slaves to their influences. For instance, distortion was exceedingly rare in chicha music, but they employ a modest amount of it on the opening guitar theme of ""Primavera en la Selva"", a brilliant track that borrows melodic themes for the organ and guitar from Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" and garage rocks the hell out of them. Nicking classical themes was a favorite habit of chicha bands (Los Destellos' version of ""Für Elise"" is amazing), and Chicha Libre pick up the thread, cutting a version of a Ravel pavane and closing the album with a slinky surf-cumbia version of Satie's ""Gnosienne No.1"". They also do one of the best versions of Gershon Kingsley's pop standard ""Popcorn"" I've ever heard, and I've heard dozens of versions of that song. ""Indian Summer"" gets an exotica injection courtesy of Allyssa Lamb's ethereal guest vocal. Though they are obviously tailoring their talents to fit a specific sonic mold, the efforts of the band members don't sound forced. In fact, they seem to write in the style with a minimum of effort. Perhaps it's simply the fact that a well-constructed melody can be adapted to just about any setting, but I think the songwriting is ultimately why the album transcends the novelty of being a tribute to an entire style of music almost no one outside of Peru has heard of. As much as I'm in love with the record, though, I admit that it is still probably destined for a niche market of listeners who are interested in these sorts of global melting pot sounds-- Spanish lyrics likely won't help it on that front. Not that that's a bad thing, just a marketplace reality. Regardless, ¡Sonido Amazonico! achieves what it sets out to do, which is to pay creative homage to an overlooked genre from a corner of the world few of us will ever see but all of us are invisibly connected to by the weather.","This Brooklyn band specializes in the little-know form of chicha, which takes Peruvian folk styles and incorporates elements of Cuban and American pop and surf guitar music.

A Wheel Within a Wheel,Southeast Engine,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b56dc0084474cd0c240a/1:1/w_160/70bbb0d7.jpg,2008-05-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11343-a-wheel-within-a-wheel/,Misra,"Athens, Ga., is a scene brimming with well-known national acts. Athens, Ohio? Not so much. If that makes the college town's Southeast Engine relatively big fish in a small pond, that still hardly means many people have heard the band splashing around. Indeed, 2005's mostly overlooked Coming to Terms With Gravity was solid if not wholly compelling Americana in the just-left-of-traditional mold (think: Wilco), though clearly leader Adam Remnant wasn't completely comfortable being pegged as alt-country. If A Wheel Within a Wheel isn't exactly the sound of a band casting off its shackles, it is the sound of a band at least buckling a little to conventions. Instrumentally, with its emphasis on rootsy piano and strings, much of A Wheel Within a Wheel still scans as Americana. It's the substance where things get stretched a bit, with strong, personal, sometimes powerful results that potentially could raise the group's profile. A Wheel Within a Wheel begins with a cynical epiphany, blasted out with the opening ""Taking the Fall"". It's not necessarily an exceptional song, but it does set the tone for the rest of the disc. ""Now it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust/ Well, I've always done what I've wanted but now I do what I must,"" proclaims Remnant, and that same disillusionment with the inevitable winds its way through nearly every track. Love/hate, life/death, truth/lies-- the album's nothing so much as a series of bitter revelations that the innocence of youth is an illusion, and that anyone looking only to man for guidance is doomed. The title A Wheel Within a Wheel is a reference to the book of Ezekiel, where god is depicted as a sort of multi-dimensional hallucinogenic elemental vision, four creatures combined as one, accompanied by lightning, fire, and noise. Said wheel makes a few appearances throughout the album, most notably following as overt a cry for help as you can get, a song not so subtly titled ""Oh God, Let Me Back In"". Yet A Wheel Within a Wheel is more complex than the average Christian rock tract. The Biblical/religious imagery running throughout the disc doesn't tip the group's hand so much as provide the album a fruitful thematic framework as Remnant shouts into the abyss in search of answers. Given the neo-theological angst of the album, it's not much of a shock that the music often matches the soul dividing sturm und drang driving the disc. It's rock opera, part Dante, part indie du jour, bombastic, to be sure, but never hectoring as it makes its way to moral détente. In fact, the album's plea to god comes not as righteousness but only after Remnant himself (or at least the album's narrator) hits rock bottom. ""Taking the Fall"" (""fall"" being a particularly loaded word here) and ""Ostrich"" tackle the trauma of learning life isn't always fair, and, hey, we're all going to die some day, anyway. In the brisk ""We Have You Surrounded"", cynicism and doubt have totally taken over, the divine gift of free will subverted to reject the attendant catches. In ""Quit While You're Ahead"", Remnant is desperate for some guidance: ""Tell me what I believe,"" he pleads. By ""Pursuit of Happiness"" (in two parts), the aimlessness of nihilism begins to weigh on his soul. ""When the facts turn into fiction, your voice is overturned/ Do you still believe in nothing?"" He's answered in ""Psychoanalysis"", where recollections of childhood give way to the telltale vision of the wheel within a wheel and, as far as the story goes, a fateful choice: embrace the ""State of Oblivion"", or look to the lord for salvation? The album goes the latter route, if only because it makes for a much better narrative arc. Between the end of the world and everlasting happiness, goes the reasoning, why would anyone choose the former? Needless to say, the aforementioned explicit cry for god's forgiveness is answered and accepted, but to Remnant's credit all is not left neat and tidy. If anything, the comfort of god makes life more bearable but no more fair. ""All I've been taught to really know turns to dust or turns to stone,"" concludes ""Fortune Teller"". But in the concluding ""Let It Be So"", that doesn't seem as bad as it sounds. Remnant's been tested and emerged stronger, the knowledge of injustice and pain not a curse but the key to move beyond empty fatalism. God's gift, it turns out, is allowing us to know that the future is what we make of it. ""So let Fortune turn her wheel, and let the serpent take its tail out of its mouth,"" sings Remnant, finally at ease with the understanding that happiness is his, if he wants it. ""I'm here to love you,"" he sings, to god, to a lost love, to all of the above. ""That's the happiness I pursue.""","Athens, Ohio's Southeast Engine see the light and release a rock opera of self-doubt and redemption.

The Secret Life,New Bloods,by: D. Shawn Bosler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5b9b1335d7bf169a94c/1:1/w_160/3224032b.jpg,2008-05-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11413-the-secret-life/,Kill Rock Stars,"Dance-y dub bass lines conjoined to spazzy tribal-punk drums isn't necessarily the rarest find, but add a shrieky, front-porched, heel-stomping folky violin as the main melodic instrument and the novelty blossoms. That this spirited and uncommon foundation is being worked by three lesbian punks from Portland, Ore., and that two of them are African-American, and that all three sing, yelp, and shout-- often in-the-round, sometimes in unison-- makes things increasingly more interesting and even harder to peg. Add to those unlikely equations the fact that these young ladies have done their homework regarding subcultural agitators: Two of them, violinist Osa Atoe and drummer Adee Roberson, had known each other through the underground zine trading scene where they each documented and heralded black subculture (political, musical, visual arts) and riot grrrl bands in their respective publications Shotgun Seamstress (Atoe's), and Finger on the Trigger (Roberson's now retired mag). This appears to have laid a good foundation for not only quality prose (diggin' the inner strength-seeking childlike fantasy lyrics of ""No. 17"" and ""Tree""), but sonically may have helped them to crib a little from heroes like ESG, Sleater-Kinney, the Raincoats, and Kleenex. On paper, the New Bloods' disparate musical styles don't sound like such a great combo: Tunes such as ""Behind Mountains"" and ""Doubles"" contrast angular and aggressive rhythmic bass and drum attacks with a joyously twisted Americana violin-- too arty to call it a fiddle-- but then on top of all that are bouncy bassist Cassia Gammill's velvety smooth vocal lines, Atoe's punky sing-song-y speak-sing, and Roberson's sporadic reggae-toasting shouts. It shouldn't work, but it does. It's a wild and wonderful combination where weird individual parts coalesce to make a unified songwriting machine. Two of the album's best tracks, opener ""The Secret Life"" and ""Oh, Deadly Nightshade!"" show off smart songcraft and a groove-based group-mind: The former takes distinctive passages that flow breezily-- even though clanky drums rumble underneath-- only to lock in for unison group-vocal barking. And the circular and trancey ""Oh, Deadly Nightshade!""-- probably the most musically refined track-- flips from pizzicato strings to staccato bowing to ""Skip to My Lou"" ho-downs as vocal styles and phrasings simultaneously keep morphing. For a debut with such a fully realized and individual presence, something tells me these ladies are going to continue to burrow as wide as this earnest, impressive debut hits deep. The only real complaint, and this should easily be rectified as they keep rocking together, is that a few songs do suffer from awkward vocal phrasings (""The Sea is Alive in Me"") and a sometimes sloppy off-kilterness (""The Cycle Song""). But delicate and deliberate tunes like the fully a cappella ""Day After Day"" and, once again, the self-titled track, hint at future magical possibilities.","Portland trio debuts strong with songs comprised of spazzy tribal-punk drums, dub basslines, shouty unison vocals, and lots of violin.

The Hungry Saw,Tindersticks,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f05e6ef95969322867/1:1/w_160/1e6dd416.jpg,2008-05-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11462-the-hungry-saw/,Beggars BanquetConstellation,"""Too many deaths and betrayals, too many lies,"" sings Stuart Staples on the seventh Tindersticks album, providing a handy episode update for those finally just joining the Nottingham noir-soul sextet. But, as it appears in the context of the breezy piano-rolled folk lullaby ""The Flicker of a Little Girl"", the line sounds less like an advertisement for Tindersticks' signature brand of sorrow than a repudiation of it-- that after nearly two decades of pondering love and all its attendant emotions (jealousy, misery, numbness), Staples regrets to inform you he's all out of regret. But then Staples hasn't so much turned a new leaf as had one turned for him: In 2006, half of his band turned in their resignation papers, most notably Dickon Hinchcliffe, who, in the most reductive rock-speak, was the Richards to Staples' Jagger (if Keith was a violin player and wrote a mean brass arrangement). And amid a career marked by label changes, Tindersticks-- reconstituted as a five piece-- once again find themselves with a new North America benefactor: Constellation Records, whose godspeed-dominated roster is becoming increasingly populated with former major-label-bankrolled eccentrics (Vic Chestnutt, Carla Bozulich) seeking artistic refuge and a second (or third) wind. Ironically, Tindersticks' first offering to the most notoriously non-conformist indie label this side of Dischord is an album that feels remarkably in tune with contemporary British pop music's neo-soul slant. Though for Tindersticks, this is hardly a product of calculated trend-spotting: The band have been leavening their blue-eyed/black-lung balladry with classic soul touches-- warm Hammond organ tones, tambourine-rattled rhythms, female back-up singers— as far back as 1999's un-ironically titled Simple Pleasures, an album that, at the time, seemed to pale next to the string-swept dramatics that defined Tindersticks' epochal first three albums. But nine years on, that move seems brilliantly prescient-- to the point where, now, it's not a stretch to envision Staples selling The Hungry Saw's first single, the nocturnal soul knockout ""Yesterdays Tomorrows"", to Amy Winehouse and retiring a happy man. Naturally, that song appears second on the new album's tracklist (following a typically solemn introductory piano piece), because Tindersticks have always been a second-song band, opting for low-key opening tracks before delivering a bold follow-up strike-- from the devastating ""A Night In"" on 1995's self-titled second album, to the simmering ""Heard It Through the Grapevine"" strut of ""People Keep Comin' Around"" on 2001's Can Our Love… to the raging pocket symphony ""Say Goodbye to the City"" on 2003's Waiting for the Moon. But in The Hungry Saw's case, the early appearance of ""Yesterday Tomorrow""-- with its booming drumbeat, lustrous organ tones and brassy accents-- seems designed to assert that Hinchcliffe's departure has not diminished the band's cinematic scope. With that business settled, the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation, in the spirit of Staples' recent solo efforts. Of course, Staples' bruised baritone has always formed the emotional core of just about every Tindersticks song. However, the band's most arresting moments have come when Staples' vulnerable voice seems on the verge of being swept up by the musical maelstroms stewing around him, and, with few exceptions, The Hungry Saw doesn't really try to test his fortitude: with their smoky, solitary atmosphere and muted string arrangements, ""The Other Side of the World"" and ""All the Love"" are textbook Tindersticks ballads-- and beautifully rendered ones at that-- but they don't ever go for the throat like their closest antecedent, Waiting for the Moon's stunning orchestral set piece, ""My Oblivion"". Instead, The Hungry Saw's temperate approach feels like the work of a band who are grateful for a new lease on life, but not sure exactly what to do with it, proffering brief experiments that amount to little more than amusing curios (the self-explanatory ""The Organist Entertains"") or instrumentals that sound like guide tracks waiting for a vocal supplement (the tremoloed psychedelic samba of ""E Type""). The laissez-faire feeling seems most pronounced on ""Mother Dear"", a fog-covered hymnal guided by muffled organ tones and a subterranean drum stomp that-- just after Staples utters the line ""it's not so serious, after all""-- is mischievously interrupted by arrhythmic blues riffing that suggests the band has a sense of humour about their downcast demeanor. It's immediately followed by ""Boobar"", which for its opening 20 seconds, suggests another solitary Staples serenade about lost love, before slowly blossoming into a wonderful Spectorized call-and-response finale. If The Hungry Saw teaches us anything new about Tindersticks, it's that these moments of levity no longer serve as brief, incongruous respites from the bleakness, but instead form a series of steps toward an end goal of contentment-- as epitomized by closing track ""The Turns We Took"". The titular line is completed by the words ""…to get here""-- ""here"" being a soothing, string-swirled Velvet Underground groove over which Staples catalogues a lifetime of cruel twists and-- perhaps speaking for the entire band-- decides there's no shame in walking the straight line.","The lush, veteran noir-soul band-- reconstituted as a five piece-- here reconciles its well-established affinities with a more pastoral presentation.

After the Balls Drop,Les Savy Fav,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f29d034d5c69bf50ef/1:1/w_160/77b4bcfc.jpg,2008-05-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11465-after-the-balls-drop/,Frenchkiss,"There aren't many frontmen in music nowadays that would strip down to a speedo and jump into a teeming mass of 20,000 fans with a Slip 'n Slide. It's that sort of kamizake bravado that makes Les Savy Fav such a fantastic live act. Seeing that sort of derring-do come from someone like Tim Harrington-- tall, bald, and paunchy-- makes the spectacle even more amazing. Harrington stalks the stage like a crazed hobo, hanging from any fixtures and pipes within reach, working the crowd like he's equal parts punk-rock provocateur and motivational messiah. And all the while, as unsuspecting audience members are smothered in his sweaty embrace, the band goes about their business in a professional, kick-ass manner. Not many live experiences available top seeing Les Savy Fav. Unfortunately, the things that make their live show so great are the same things that make releasing a Les Savy Fav live album a dodgy proposition. That said, After the Balls Drop manages to make the most of these potential shortcomings, offering listeners a charming, warts-and-all portrait of the group. Given the time and place of the show documented, the group could be forgiven for not being on top of its game. The recording took place at a Bowery Ballroom New Year's Eve/Day show at 3 a.m., a time of morning that, when coupled with that time of the year, doesn't do many folks any favors (unless I'm the only one going to parties where 3 a.m. means half the party-goers are sleeping and the other half are throwing up). The crowd sounds up to the challenge, but the group-- Harrington in particular-- takes a long while to get into the spirit of the moment. Harrington jokes before the set starts that he just came back from running a 5K marathon for the ""Who Needs a Wish Foundation."" It's as plausible an excuse as any for why he sounds out-of-breath when trying to keep up with the show's first song, ""The Equestrian"". His being out of sorts while trying to both sing and do whatever the hell he decides to do is great when you're actually at the show seeing what's going on. When you can't see what's going on, however, you're left with some wheezing, panting guy that misses about half the words he's supposed to sing, and a fair number of notes he's supposed to hit. It's no big deal when dealing with older songs where he's required to scream more than sing-- he kills here on ""The Sweat Descends"" and ""Yawn Yawn Yawn""-- but the more melodically robust songs from Let's Stay Friends (three of which lead off this set) suffer. The group gets a second wind midway through the set (conveniently enough, around the time Harrington gets the crowd going by asking if they're fading or fired up-- you can guess what won out). LSF gleefully rip through ""The Year Before the Year 2000"" and ""The Lowest Bitter"" (with the latter featuring Harrington on kazoo), then stretches out the seething intro for ""Who Rocks the Party"" (from The Cat & The Cobra). This gives way to ""Tim's Speech"", a 15-minute track which is actually a seven-minute version of ""Rome"" (from the EP of the same name) and eight superfluous minutes of the crowd calling for an encore, along with a brief speech from Harrington-- after the band returns to the stage-- concerning the issues of trust and an audience member using his sister's ID to get into the show. What follows the speech is the real reason to drop some cash on this set-- five enthusiastic covers of variable quality that bring the show home. The versions of Creedence Clearwater Revival (""Hey Tonight"") and the Misfits (""Astro Zombies"") are the best of the bunch, though the group's run through the chosen Pixies (""Debaser"") and Nirvana (""Sliver"") tracks are also fun. Their ramshackle campfire version of Love's ""Everybody's Gotta Live"" is the perfect closer for a set that ultimately sounds less like a show held at a legitimate concert venue and more like the sort of raucous hoe-down you'd find at a house party.","Not many live experiences top seeing Les Savy Fav, and the band tried to capture and house its unhinged stage madness on this digital-only release.

Unhistories,Singer,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c45e6ef95969322813/1:1/w_160/03a0c560.jpg,2008-04-30 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11422-unhistories/,Drag City,"The CD insert for Singer's Unhistories consists of two parts: one lone, jewel case-sized square-- the album's linoleum-floor cover-- detailing the song titles and members of the band on the reverse side, and a four-page fold-out. The outside of the fold-out features four black-and-white photos of the exterior of a dilapidated house; on the opposite side are the members of the band looking through the house's windows, each face filling the entire frame. You can create a tiny box with this insert if you stand it on its edge and touch the two end pages together-- a small abandoned house out in the middle of nowhere, with the band looking in at each other from the outside. It's a perfect metaphor for this confounding yet alluring album. The record itself fittingly kicks off with some false starts, with drummer Adam Vida sounding like a lawnmower engine that won't turn over. Eventually, the band finally breaks into ""Slow Ghosts"", a lurching spastic number punctuated with chirpy guitar runs and bouts of harmonized moaning. With two former members of U.S. Maple on baord-- Adam Vida and guitarist Todd Rittman-- some listeners will peg this album in those terms. (Anyone hoping to draw direct sonic connections between Robert Lowe's work with 90 Day Men and this album, on the other hand, will end up disappointed.) In those fleeting moments when there's a particularly frantic guitar filigree (either by Rittman or Ben Vida), or a certain stumbling roll of the drums, it sounds like Al Johnson's indomitable hoarse wheeze is the only thing keeping the U.S. Maple name off the spine. However, where Singer's music most emulates the former works of its members is in its sense of musical anti-orthodoxy-- love them or loathe them, what they tried to do didn't sound like much else around. For Singer, this iconoclasm extends beyond the actual music. Instead of having one frontman, Singer opts to treat the band as a true democracy, giving every member their turn at the microphone. Good luck trying to figure out which one is which, though-- the disc credits only include who's on the record and who produced it, and more often than not they're singing together. Solo or in unison, their quivering falsettos and affected croons might owe something to David Bowie or any of his followers, but ultimately the group's vocal turns are just as individualistic as their musical accompaniment. One minute they're aping the madrigal whimsy of labelmates Faun Fables (on ""Divining""), the next they're looping guitar drones in back of passionate vocal quivering (on ""Mauvais Sang""). Handholds and signposts are few and far between, and any groove the band locks into can just as easily be transformed or simply abandoned without warning. There's an organic jazz-like spontaneity to Unhistories that listeners will consider either obnoxious or endearing. These tracks are less like songs and more like awkward whispered conversations between people that are just beginning to know each other. While the end results of these ""talks"" might bear fruit that most would rather do without, these are definitely conversations worth having.","Led by 90 Day Men/Lichens' Rob Lowe, and featuring two former members of U.S. Maple, this iconoclastic Drag City band aims for a sound all its own.

Box of Hair,Cub,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5319d034d5c69bf4fac/1:1/w_160/14d4d53c.jpg,2008-04-30 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11294-box-of-hair/,Lookout!MintLookout!Mint,"If you can't beat 'em, try to fool 'em into thinking you've joined 'em. By third album Box of Hair in 1996, Vancouver-based trio Cub had settled into a consistent lineup-- drummer Lisa G, bassist/frontwoman Lisa Marr, and guitarist Robynn Iwata-- and established a distinctive style: sugary three-chord indie pop, cuddly as it was catchy, with a spoonful of punk's spiky do-it-yourself energy. Their closest peers were such melodic and unabashedly girlish-voiced acts as Amelia Fletcher's Talulah Gosh, Rose Melberg's Tiger Trap, or Juliana Hatfield's Blake Babies. Yet along with more likely bedfellows They Might Be Giants, who have since segued into children's music, Cub toured with the sad-bastard likes of Sebadoh and Elliott Smith. Cub toughen up their guitar tones and their vocal chords for Box of Hair, but, thankfully, they don't lose too much of themselves trying to appeal to the punker-than-thou types who used to heap scorn on anything cute or girly (plenty of people still do). ""Freaky"" starts the album at a breakneck pace, Lisa Marr's voice turning into a phlegmy sneer, but the refrain is ""Let's play house."" On ""Magic 8 Ball"", Marr serenades a crush with a list of lucky charms, as accordion, lilting harmonies, and a rickety, Merseybeat-esque backing move to a chorus about the title toy. One of Cub's best-ever songs? Decidedly so. Summery sex bomb ""Pillow Queen"", princess-obsessed substance-abuse ode ""Loaded"", and saw-backed insult ""Box of Hair"" all use a little distortion and aggression to help the sweetness go down. ""Main and Broadway"", with its chiming lead guitars and homey melancholy, should appeal to fans of present-day indie-poppers like Voxtrot and Vampire Weekend. Box of Hair isn't always as successful as recently reissued predecessors Betti Cola and Come Out, Come Out, but even the plainer tracks pack a joyful punch. Feedback-drenched ""One Last Kiss"" is about as rowdily mosh-ready as Cub get, Marr belting out, ""Give it to me, baby"" with the insolence of a twee Iggy Pop. The album's basic framework doesn't vary much, though. While the second half's slight change-ups-- barnstorming riff-rock on ""S.G."", lead vocals by guitarist Iwata on ""Way to Go"", violin on ""Riverside""-- aren't enough to make these songs stand out in context, they'd still have a warm charm played individually on, say, college radio. As if to prove to the boys they can do it, Cub end the LP with a rocket-fueled live version of ""Not What You Think"", sung-screamed by drummer G after a quick countdown. ""I wanna be alone!"" she shouts. Writing in SF Weekly in 1996, author and former The New York Times guest columnist Sarah Vowell concluded that this thrashing hardcore track redeemed a record she otherwise considered to be excessively sweet: ""Box of Hair is a one-song album -- but what a song."" While Box of Hair was Cub's best bet to please people for whom My Little Pony could never be punk, if you're listening to Cub for their ""god-awful noise,"" go ahead and suffer through the album's hidden-track half hour of bed creaks, which lead into an aborted ""Not What You Think"" outtake. Everybody else should leave that bullshit off their iPods and come expecting a disc that sounds like the photo in the CD liner: a fuzzy, adorable kitten, who happens to look like he's about to snarl. Break out your Strawberry Shortcake lunchbox and dig in.","Vancouver twee outfit's 1996 album, now reissued, is a fine showcase of the band's style: sugary three-chord indie pop, cuddly as it is catchy, with a spoonful of punk's spiky do-it-yourself energy.

Valentine's more naked vocal moments evoke a young PJ Harvey; she also sometimes sounds like Courtney Love in better days. Other precedents include Boss Hog, the garage rock (and likewise married) duo of Jon Spencer and Cristina Martinez, and Kim Gordon, when she cuts loose over Sonic Youth's bluesy side. But Jucifer's range far exceeds that of these bands. Smart pop, quiet balladry, and bludgeoning sludge metal are all fair game, making the band's records feel like patchwork. Valentine's voice ties things together, however; her croon sounds equally at home over acoustic guitar and Jucifer's wall of amps. (The band is famed for insanely loud shows involving upwards of 10-15 amp cabinets.) In Boss Hog, Cristina Martinez achieved some success with cooing over abrasion. However, Valentine sounds sweet and relatively innocent, which makes her screaming that much more startling during Jucifer's tougher moments. L'autrichienne is the band's most ambitious work yet. It's a sprawling, 21-song concept album about Marie Antoinette, who was nicknamed ""l'Autrichienne"" due to her Austrian origin and connections. Valentine tackled the subject after finding a book on the French Revolution in an RV park lending library. (She and Livengood have lived on the road in an RV for the past seven years; their MySpace lists them as ""NOMADS 4EVER."") The album's liner notes are endearingly nerdy, appending historical commentary to each song. Yet this is no highbrow endeavor. The reassurance of a unifying concept allows the band to stretch out further than ever. Ragged rock is the record's axis, around which rotate considerably varying dynamics. ""The Mountain"" and ""Procession a la Guillotine"" erect walls of fuzz worthy of doom metal. One of the band's pet moves is to use hardcore punk as an EKG spike. ""Blackpowder"" leads off the album with sturdy rock, only to be steamrolled by ""Thermidor"", essentially early-1990s New York hardcore punk. Then, Valentine sings over only her guitar, evoking a more extroverted Kristin Hersh. In ""Champs De Mars"", Valentine sings quietly menacing tritones, then slams into surging riffs; it's pure PJ Harvey circa Dry. For all the band's power, it shines most when it sheathes it. Previously, when Jucifer held back, rough edges remained, and Valentine's purr was charmingly out of place. Now the band has learned how to adorn its quiet; the transformation recalls the Rolling Stones on Aftermath. ""Armada"" mushrooms from a sludgy crawl to imperial horns and lush vocal harmonies. The title track's supple clean tones and drumming evoke Jimi Hendrix and Mitch Mitchell. A wounded bird of a melody crawls in, keening with startling candor. Robert Christgau says the White Stripes build monuments that are no place to settle down. Jucifer's garage rock, in contrast, is like their RV -- richly appointed and very much home.","Guy-girl garage rock duo-- not the White Stripes-- undertake their most ambitious album yet, a sprawling 21-song opus about Marie Antoinette.

The Best of Joy Division,Joy Division,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5e5ea9e61561daa6e9a/1:1/w_160/2554f086.jpg,2008-04-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11452-the-best-of-joy-division/,Rhino,"Like the nebulous sports award ""Most Valuable Player,"" the ""Best of"" compilation has no clear standards. Should it represent a group's career? If so, The Best of Joy Division falls short, offering nothing from the band's early demos (as Warsaw) or their debut EP, An Ideal For Living. Should it consist of the most popular songs? On that count, this collection succeeds, but that's nebulous too, since Joy Division only released two full-length albums and six singles. Should it simply be unique? That's where this collection really falters: nearly half of its 14 tracks come from the recently-reissued Unknown Pleasures and Closer, and most of the rest are on the more purposeful singles compilation Substance. In fact, the bigger puzzle is why Rhino chose to release this instead of an expanded version of Substance (or at least replicate the British Best of, which included a second disc of Peel Sessions and an Ian Curtis interview). Maybe it's a rights issue, or maybe the label assumes that the recent biopic Control created new fans interested enough to lay out some cash but oddly unwilling to buy both Joy Division albums. It would be wrong to complain about anyone owning even a small amount of this band's great music, but the idea of being satisfied by a Whitman's sampler is strange. Still, The Best of Joy Division is by Joy Division, so it's good. It's hard to imagine how any such collection wouldn't be-- just shuffle the four-disc set Heart and Soul, make an album of the first 14 tracks that come up, and you'd have a winner. The essentials-- ""Transmission"", ""She's Lost Control"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Love Will Tear Us Apart""-- nestle well against album cuts, and there are nice juxtapositions, like the way ""Heart and Soul""'s throb kickstarts the post-punk-in-a-nutshell ""Incubation"", which morphs into ""Isolation""'s dubby pulse. One could quibble about omissions-- ""A Means to An End"" from Closer, ""Day of the Lords"" from Unknown Pleasures-- but every song on The Best of Joy Division is great. Regardless, there's that unmistakable air of non-necessity to this collection. It's clearly for the timidly uninitiated, and sure, it's better for anyone to hear 14 random Joy Division songs than none. But if you have any interest in this remarkable band, save the startup cash and buy Unknown Pleasures and Closer first, then Substance, then Heart and Soul. It's not a lot to invest in a group whose accomplishments continue to pay off 28 years after its demise.","Of couse the music's fantastic, but if we actually needed another Joy Division compilation, why not an expanded version of the purposeful singles collection Substance, or at least the British Best of, which included a second disc of Peel Sessions?

Jim,Jamie Lidell,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5f4b1335d7bf169a9a6/1:1/w_160/238e6228.jpg,2008-04-30 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11467-jim/,Warp,"Jamie Lidell has built his career upon surprising people, whether via his on-stage antics, sudden stylistic shifts, or cryptic interviews. But the biggest twist to his third album, Jim, might just be its lack of left turns. Jim isn't quite Lidell's Sea Change, but it's close, and not only because the singer and producer recently toured and recorded with Beck. Despite a few uptempo rockers, the album is generally subdued; its perspective is almost confessional. On the surface a collection of love songs, Jim remains obsessed with the themes of emotional imbalance, self-doubt, and dual identity that Lidell introduced on 2005's Multiply. Building on the blueprint drafted for that album, Jim deepens the singer's engagement with 1960s and 70s r&b across a carefully crafted set of ballads, rave-ups, and easygoing soul, showing off not only his considerable vocal chops but also the songwriting and studio prowess of his longtime collaborators Gonzales and Mocky. (Co-producer Mocky shares songwriting credits on virtually all the album's songs; Gonzales had a hand in two, and the Tower Recordings' collaborator Andre Vida, responsible for Multiply's horns, is credited on one.) Given Lidell's past provocations, Jim's spoonful of sugar will likely disorient some fans. But thick with hooks and Hammonds, funk squelch and background doo-wop, Jim nevertheless makes for some of the most satisfying Sunday-morning listening you'll hear this year. That Gonzalez and Mocky also played significant roles in the creation of Feist's The Reminder shouldn't be surprising. (Lidell appeared on that album as well: he sings and is credited as ""Energy Arranger"" on ""So Sorry"".) For all Lidell's background in the trenches of the rave scene and its experimental aftermath, Jim is unabashedly pop in spirit and feel-good in sound. After Lidell's abrasive first record, 2000's Muddlin' Gear and the avant-funk he concocted in the duo Super_Collider (with Chilean-English techno veteran Cristian Vogel), Multiply's sparkling keyboards, taut electric funk, and rattling tambourines often earned accusations of pastiche. That wasn't always far off: The album's songwriting, production and vocal delivery are deeply indebted to the soul tradition from Stax to Motown, Prince to D'Angelo. With its plucked bass and careful treble counterpoints, ""Multiply"", a song about the joys of a split personality, sounds almost like a repurposed ""(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay"". That combination of subject matter and source material ought to have been enough to undercut the charges that Multiply tried too hard to be ""authentic,"" but it wasn't. You can find a typical criticism in Andy Kellman's review for Allmusic.com, where he calls the album ""as authentic as any neo-soul release""-- a faint-praise damnation that makes ""authenticity"" sound positively counterfeit-- and complains that ""there's so much overly earnest, reverential, 'let's get back to making real music' energy floating around that you can sense it nibbling away at the desire to make something that sounds like today."" If anything, there's even more pastiche on Jim, but that never stops the music from sounding relevant. (Part of Jim's pleasure is that it doesn't sound terribly concerned about the sound of ""today."") The rollicking ""Where D'You Go"" is an exercise in sock-hopping 50s rock'n'roll. ""Out of My System"" burns a hole through the back of James Brown's cloak. ""Hurricane"" could almost be a White Stripes song, if they spent more time listening to the Meters and less with Led Zep. ""Out of My System"" is even more shameless in its borrowings, opening with a riff stolen from Bob Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"" and closing with railroad-whistle chants straight out of the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"". (The reference to the latter act-- as well as the ""Sheriff""-covering Eric Clapton-- serves as a useful reminder that Lidell is hardly the first white, English artist to find inspiration in African-American musical traditions.) Indeed, after listening to the heavily acoustic, era-faithful Jim, Multiply begins to sound like more of an ""electronic"" release than ever before. For all its debt to American soul forebears, the album was riddled with clever edits, digital effects, and transient random noise bursts. Jim may have been recorded in Berlin, Paris, and L.A., but its natural reverbs and warm room tones sound more intimate than that jetsetting might suggest. On Jim, the ""experimental"" bits are folded more deeply into the whole. A few minutes into ""Little Bit of Feel Good"", there's an ambient blues bridge where the soloing saxophone takes a weird modal leap; build out a loop of that and you might have the basis for a Rune Grammofon release. But by and large, the outré moments have been toned down and blended in, as with the drifting electronic touches of ""Figure Me Out"". Far more unified than Multiply, the album has a satisfyingly cohesive arc, although the comparatively banging ""Out of My System"" and ""Hurricane"" may well get left off of the make-out music playlists inspired by more Al Green-influenced fare like ""Green Light"". Jim might be far less interesting were it not for the ambiguities that Lidell brings to the table. His turn towards the personal is right there in the title; the press release goes so far as to declare, ""Jamie is Jim."" But it's never so easy with Lidell. He's a notoriously slippery artist straddling two scenes-- underground electronic-music subculture and indie hegemony-- obsessed with authenticity and distrustful of ambition. It's never clear whether Jim is also Jamie, or whether the titular character is just that, a character-- Lidell's Jim Shady, perhaps. Most of the songs on Jim are sung in second person, but Lidell's lyrical declarations cut in unpredictable ways. ""Another Day"", in which he sings of searching for ""another day/ Another way for me to open up to you"" might just be a love song, like a good half of the album's 10 tracks. But when he sings, ""I used to scream when a whisper would do,"" it's hard not to be reminded of Lidell's rep as a belter and a noisemaker, and wonder if he's not addressing the conspicuous mellowing of his sound. But ultimately, such biographical bits are probably of the greatest interest to lit-crit schooled music reviewers and potential stalkers. Jim succeeds by virtue of its polish. The record sounds simply wonderful: alternately nubby and spangled, it's like a cashmere throw that turns intermittently into a showman's cape. Lidell's voice has never sounded better than it does here. With his mellifluous melismas and effortless fillips, he's as captivating here as his sweat-soaked, seat-of-his-pants Doppelganger is on stage, just for different reasons. Three years ago, reviewing Lidell's chaotic live set, Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal wrote that ""Lidell's focus on his ancillary musical wares-- and not his main-stage voice-- seemed to demonstrate that his popular crooner persona may just be a seriously enjoyable excursion rather than a nostalgic destination."" From the Bacharach-inspired kitsch of ""Another Day"" to the touches of Nick Drake on the closing ""Rope of Sand"", Jim now suggests otherwise: This is an album by an artist getting comfortable with his softer side. It's another welcome surprise.","On Jim Jamie Lidell remains obsessed with the themes of emotional imbalance, self-doubt, and dual identity that he introduced on 2005's Multiply, and the singer deepens his engagement with classic r&b across a carefully crafted set of ballads, rave-ups, and easygoing soul.

Gong Lake,Neptune,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5bf5e6ef9596932280e/1:1/w_160/0bb28618.jpg,2008-04-29 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11417-gong-lake/,Table of the Elements,"Though Neptune have put out a lot of material over 12 years, the release of Gong Lake on experimental artists' haven Table of the Elements may net the band their widest exposure yet. Describing their records without mentioning the methods behind them, and the ensuing live spectacle, is hard to resist: On stage, they man heavy, foreboding instruments self-made from antiquated machines and scrap metal, forged at extreme angles like props from a German expressionist film. The band could never be reduced to simply performance art, though, and Gong Lake is just as rich in rhythm and atmosphere as any of their previous albums. Still, they remain primarily a live beast. Their sound is literally industrial, and it's way more fun to watch a factory bang shit out than just to hear it. Neptune still struggle with that, and even at their most song-oriented and cohesive, a Neptune record may always be an advertisement for their dramatic, otherworldly live shows. That said, Gong Lake makes for an exquisite flier. Considering the band's output on the whole, the songs on Gong Lake are comparatively discrete, and the dynamic shifts especially pronounced. Though lord knows what machine has been subverted to make the noise, many songs start from stretched, ominous tones that may as well be from keyboards, notably on songs like ""Copper Green"" where the band hangs several little noise fugues like tree ornaments on one central, icy one-note drone. Neptune do find occasions to add vocals, and any other texture is welcome with such unforgiving instrumentals. It's mostly a flat and ominous near-whisper on songs like ""Grey Shallows"", which doesn't add to the song so much as pull back the curtain a bit and disrupt their brutally mechanical groove. Vocals feel less like an afterthought on more simmering tracks like ""Black Tide"" and ""Yellow River"", adding to their seedy and ominous feel. More traditional strings (be they from baritone guitars or something more unusual) dominate songs like ""Paris Green"" and ""Blue Glass"", making them almost straightforward rockers. This is where more animated vocals struggle for some of the focus of the clattering rhythm and stunning drum performances; ""Yellow River"" strikes a better balance, as voices add to the song's foreboding, nearly hip-hop groove. From the vocals that crib from the Vincent Price playbook to the creepy-crawly vibe of instrumentals like ""Red Sea"" and ""Purple Sleep"", these songs can be campy and fun just as often as they are oppressive, and can easily be both; there's just as much of the impish sound manipulation of pioneers like Raymond Scott as there is Einstürzende Neubauten. Either way, Neptune are formidable architects of sound, regardless of what they had to build to get there. While Gong Lake is more a refinement than a breakthrough, the record doesn't suggest stasis; rather, you wonder how what could have been a performance-art gimmick has sustained itself for 12 years without running out of inspiration or steam, and Gong Lake is a fine argument for them sticking around.","Long-running experimental band from Boston, known for turning industrial implements into musical instruments, releases its first full-length on the Table of the Elements label.

Opus Mixtum,Antietam,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5a15e6ef959693227d1/1:1/w_160/3f6183a8.jpg,2008-04-29 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11391-opus-mixtum/,Carrot Top,"One could be forgiven for thinking that Antietam didn't exist anymore. Even at the relative height of its popularity, the Louisville-turned-Hoboken band turned heads with legendary live performances but didn't exactly raise the head count of its fans (poppy guitar freakout peers such as Yo La Tengo and Eleventh Dream Day included among them). As far as many of those fans were concerned, Antietam ended after 1994's slept-on Rope-A-Dope, and if the band in its heyday flew under the radar, that's nothing compared to the low profile of its 2004 comeback Victory Park. Now Antietam have risen once again, and anyone clamoring for some classic indie-rock will be heartened by the arrival of Opus Mixtum, two-discs of new Antietam music recorded by the surprisingly stable trio of singer/guitar hero Tara Key, bassist Tim Harris, and drummer Josh Madell, the band's core since 1991. Yes, two discs, drawn from two separate sessions originally envisioned for two separate albums, one highlighting the band's softer side and the other its status as one of the great forgotten guitar shredders of the indie era. Yet if there's a downside to Antietam's longevity, it's that at this stage in the game the band really doesn't have much to add to the conversation. Even at two discs, Opus Mixtum hardly overstays its welcome, but the degree of welcome it meets is likely linked to your preference for the familiar Neil Young-does-VU school of indie that ruled the underground in the 1980s. It's hardly a straight nostalgia trip, but at the same time Key, Harris, and Madell in 2008 aren't exactly pushing things forward. That's not what Antietam are about, though. The band's not out to change the rules but raise the roof, and at its best Opus Mixtum accents the relative timelessness of Antietam's music. Songs like ""Shipshape"", ""Turn It on Me"", ""Pennants and Flags"", and ""That's the Way It Is"" would have earned a prime place on college radio in any era. One could even imagine a simple song like the instrumental ""Arrowhead Syrup"" or the rollicking ""Needle and the Eye"", sharpened with better production and beefed up with beaucoup marketing bucks, as leftfield alt-rock hits. Admittedly, that's ""alt"" as in ""alternate-reality,"" as Antietam, accessible though they may be, recognize there's a place for their music and that place will always be under the radar. Modest expectations give the group great confidence when it comes to crafting its brand of indie meat and potatoes rock, as does the knowledge that jaws will drop when Antietam tear it up on-stage. Still, that confidence can only carry Antietam so far. Even the (superior) Eleventh Dream Day quickly hit a glass ceiling before settling for an Antietam-styled part-time existence. Yet if the band is first and foremost about fretwork, feedback, and churning riffs, Antietam's mellower moments don't sound totally out of place. The cinematic strum of the instrumental ""Steel G"" seems all about the open road at sunset, while ""Red Balloon Waltz"" and ""The Gate Closed"" (both also instrumental) are no less evocative. ""Hasten"" substitutes the usual Antietam all-out dynamics with whispered vocals and trumpet. ""On the Humble"" bridges the Byrds with the VU, and ""Tierra del Fuego"" ends the album on a drifting, droning note, drawing out to nearly ten minutes of gentle folk and dubby effects. It makes you wonder whether Opus Mixtum might have been better separated into vocal and instrumental discs, the better to show off these two complementary sides of the band.","Antietam return with more-- a lot more-- Neil Young-meets-VU-styled gems.
