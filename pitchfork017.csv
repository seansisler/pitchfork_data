We Have Sound,Tom Vek,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9a4ea9e61561daa5a8b/1:1/w_160/d8283c84.jpg,2005-07-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8540-we-have-sound/,StarTimeTummy Touch,"Tom Vek must have been beaten by lead guitar lines as a kid-- he avoids them like a sore subject. And that's perfect, because it gives me something to talk about. He wants to call himself ""raw garage rock energy,"" go ahead. Nobody's exactly guarding the doors to the genre these days, but Mr. Vek managed to slip in without the one fuck-all must-have accessory. No, not a Blackberry-- I'm talking hammy riffs. Now, lead bass lines, there's another story. Matter fact, Mr. Vek is not averse to melody-- quite the contrary-- just the melodious thunks come from unexpected sources. Opener ""C-C (You Set the Fire in Me)"" (which is opposite how the titular chorus is actually delivered) locks the high school funk jammers in the garage and positions the four-track at or around the local gas station. Safely distanced, we catch tinny drums and wormy bass-- all we need, thanks. The bulk of We Have Sound's 10 tracks are as described. Mr. Vek stands interestingly aloof from his backing band (himself), sprinkling on yawning synth swells and, yawn, reverbed vocals. Some will hear the prominent rhythms and levy him with Gang of Four-ish comparisons, but I'm hearing more Hanson. Must be the locks. Actually, a song like ""I Ain't Saying My Goodbyes"" (single) would be a radio smash if a) Mr. Vek had a Blackberry, and b) he used it to contact Sony. Instead, he'll have to settle for heavy rotation on my iTunes playlist marked ""Radio"", next to Dangerdoom and ""Konichiwa Bitches"". And, ya know, bias aside, that ain't such a bad place for a 24-year-old London beau whose name isn't Kano. Remove the begging-to-be-DFA-remixed ""If You Want"" and the blatant Talking Heads rip ""Nothing But Green Lights"", Mr. Vek has himself a solid, solid record here. Of those two songs I just zinged, the latter one actually isn't bad. So-- droll sung/spoken vox, chirruping synth loop, mind-numbing repetition-- it carbon copies ""Once in a Lifetime"". Try writing a song that doesn't! I only wish that Mr. Vek, when he isn't plagiarizing or talking about cars (all the time), would ditch the blasé monotone and work his falsetto. When Venn diagraming standout ""I Ain't Saying Goodbyes"" and the déclassé ""Cover"", a simple neck crane seems, indeed, the missing ingredient. With a penchant for sloppy dance beats and an ear for sonic minutiae, Tom Vek unites skill sets as antipodal as Rapture and Elvrum. But considering one cannot legally, conscientiously or sincerely enjoy indie rock anymore, We Have Sound puts me in an awkward spot.","With a penchant for sloppy dance beats and an ear for sonic minutiae, Vek unites skill sets as antipodal as the Rapture and Phil Elvrum.

A Million in Prizes: The Anthology,Iggy Pop,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ed5e6ef9596932008c/1:1/w_160/04fdbd65.jpg,2005-07-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6410-a-million-in-prizes-the-anthology/,Virgin,"The title of Iggy Pop's second career retrospective seems to me as arbitrary as, say, That's Like Hypnotizin' Chickens or Of Course I've Had It in the Ear Before, albeit much less entertaining. And it's subtitled like we've been waiting for it for a long, long time-- which is true, but only to an extent. For the past nine years, Pop's career has been summarized only by the single-disk Nude & Rude: The Best of Iggy Pop, which tried to explain a complex artist in only 17 tracks. Even to an initiate, Nude & Rude had to seem only cursory-- a problem A Million in Prizes seeks to correct. It collects 38 tracks from nearly 40 years (!), including alternate takes, non-album tracks, and live cuts. It renders its predecessor immediately obsolete-- look for N&R; to flood your local used CD store-- and is probably as good a Pop retrospective as we're likely to get on two disks. Most collections like this give us an opportunity to reassess an artist's accomplishments and reconsider the shape and effect of their output. A Million in Prizes: The Anthology, however, seems just the opposite: several years of revisiting and reconsidering his past work have finally culminated in a retrospective anthology that might be the crest of a second wave that started with Trainspotting (did it really? or did it just seem to?) and has been building ever since. In the intervening decade, Pop has become a legend to the garage rock bands and punk nostalgics while remaining a guiding saint to throngs of disaffected adolescents (including the dropout who used to blare ""Lust for Life"" in the apartment above me all hours of the day and night). Todd Haynes made a movie about him, Jim Jarmusch made a movie with him, and we here at Pitchfork placed four Iggy-related albums on our Top 100 Albums of the 70s list. Murmured rumors and outright statements claim that Pop's the father of both punk and the garage-rock revival. While it's tempting to assign that extra meaning to his stage surname, influence does not necessary produce a positive paternity test. Pop is punk only in retrospect. Instead of defining a movement (that already had a leg up with MC5 and wouldn't hit full steam for several more years), the Stooges simply stripped 50s rock and roll down to its animal essence-- broken-glass blues riffs, steady backbeats, and punctuating hand claps-- then exaggerated its hedonistic appetites and self-destructive tendencies to brutish, nearly comic proportions on their first three albums, which are represented by 10 tracks on A Million in Prizes-- almost a fourth of the compilation. I can't really argue with that. The Stooges' distillation of rock is no small feat, but Pop wasn't a first amendment pioneer. A succession of 60s artists from Jim Morrison to Lou Reed had already cleared the way for Pop's anarchic aesthetic, but just as this lineage doesn't dull his music, neither does it dull his legacy. Instead, it points out his distinct accomplishment-- the performative aspect of his music. It wasn't the lyrics that made his songs dangerous, but Pop's yelping insistence, the depraved howls that punctuated his verses and hid a curiously smooth baritone. Just like his body, his voice was wiry and exposed and graceful, slithering and bleeding and peanut-buttery. The first disk of A Million in Prizes showcases this aspect of Pop's music, but the second disk has the unenviable task of summing up everything since, from New Values and Soldier to Beat Em Up and Skull Ring. Admittedly, there are some incredible moments: the live cut of ""TV Eye"" from the 1993 Feile Festival in Ireland suggests Pop hasn't lost as much edge on stage as he has in the studio. Two duets stand out: he and B-52 Kate Pierson are well matched on the wistful ""Candy"", and he and Debbie Harry have a goof with Cole Porter's ""Well, Did You Evah!"" from Red Hot + Blue. And even though it mercifully omits his collaboration with Peaches, the second disk can't possibly match the first for sheer raw power. Really, who could keep it up that long? But A Million in Prizes tells a story that's greater than the individual tracks themselves, one that elevates even the dimmest of material. Even so, there's something a little sad about seeing such a vital artist canonized like this. Greatest hits compilations are round holes into which pegs of every shape are fitted, and they tend to have a neutering effect, absorbing rebel music into the very system it once railed against. Even though A Million in Prizes accomplishes exactly what it set out to do, it's difficult to get excited about this collection, especially with upcoming reissues of The Stooges and Fun House to look forward to.","Two-disc, career-spanning compilation includes the best from Iggy's solo and Stooges career, and some of his recent material, too.

Pro Agonist,Exile,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0cea9e61561daa7612/1:1/w_160/51ae9fa7.gif,2005-07-27 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2931-pro-agonist/,Planet µ,"Though you wouldn't know it to listen to bulk of Pro Agonist, Exile is a junglist. He has releases on some of the genre's biggest and most seminal labels, including Moving Shadow, Renegade Hardware, and John B's Beta. He is as comfortable with rigid electro-steppers as breakneck break splicing and drooling drumfunk. The first track, ""Silicon Chop"", is a collaboration between Exile and Sub Focus, currently the king of peak-time super-rave drum & bass via his releases on Ram like ""X-Ray"". But, as with many English techheads who prefer the bucolic splendor of the Midlands, he's also something of a rotter. Pro Agonist, for example, is on Mike ""U-Ziq"" Paradinas' Planet Mu label. Despite being home to the collected works of jungle god Remarc, the label's concept of jungle owes much to the Squarepusher tempo tantrum school. And though his tunes often do feature a traditional junglist structure-- intro/drop/breakdown/drop/outro-- Exile can't resist corroding that framework with digital abuse. The aforementioned ""Silicon Chop"" and ""Open Mike"" imagine a tentative bridgehead between big-room drum & bass and the micro-intensities of the Inperspective Records choppage scene. ""Silicon Chop"" takes a fat, cheesy synth hook aimed straight at the teenage raver as the eye of its hurricane of metallic, scuttling bongos, phased snares, and ants-in-your-pants drum bits. ""The Forever Endeavor"" stomps like gabba, shoots random bursts of breaks into the air, and gouges you with cattle prod synth surges. ""Sure You Did"" samples a few of his pals' incredulity at his own fucked up beats in true Aphexian fashion. And that's where things take a bit of a wrong turn. ""Mushroom Santa"" features an excessively twee ""childlike"" melody married to shrill, chipper drill & bass beats that even the biggest spunk jazz apologist would have to call a joke. (And even if it is, I still ended up skipping it from the second play on.) ""Spring Cum Air"" is slightly better with its Selected Ambient Works II atmosphere and flurries of computer pings and plucks, as if Derek Bailey suddenly took up a iBook. His remix of John B's ""Broken Language"" sounds like eight different drum & bass tunes sutured messily together on the fly with a pocket knife and some cinnamon dental floss. ""The Devil's Chimney""-- with creepy ""the devil is in exile"" sample followed by an avalanche of EQ'd-to-fuck ""Amen"" snares and gothic rave stabs-- is straight forward enough for one of the more brutalist neo-techstep labels. It makes me sound like an old disco grouch to prefer this to the more ""my jazz is useless"" pervert-o glitch like ""Rage Is The Beautiful Light That Struck Her"". (Oy, those titles.) I guess I had been hoping for more tunes like ""Silicon Chop"" and his excellent 2005 single ""Cut By Plastic"". Records that sprouted unsightly moles and hair in odd places but were still recognizably drum & bass. Instead I got that plus a side of ProTools fuzz and kooky samples about chiming penises. If that's more your thing, you can look at is as getting a side of a few really forward-thinking dance tunes. And then wash that beard.","Junglist takes a course at the Squarepusher tempo tantrum school.

No Business,Negativland,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c213d197565213bddb/1:1/w_160/3e5b1e99.gif,2005-07-27 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5740-no-business/,Mordam,"The latest from audio collagists Negativland employs three rhetorical strategies to examine the nature of fair use in an age when corporate media outlets are fighting battles on the grassroots, unregulated frontier of the internet. How copyright law affects artists and consumers is a topic on which Negativland is well-qualified to hold forth, having spent their career pushing against the boundaries of fair use to demonstrate how it impedes artistic progress and serves record companies more than the artists it avers to protect. The first angle is an essay called ""Two Relationships to a Cultural Public Domain"". Even though it's fairly even-handed, it is essentially polemical in nature, lucidly outlining the cultural developments and opposing points of view that will be more obliquely addressed on the CD. The crux is that the internet has galvanized a drastic ideological polarization as to what constitutes the public domain. The mainstream record industry's position is a throwback to when cultural product was replicated via physical means, which spawned material artifacts of limited supply and calculable monetary value. The opposing position stems from the prominence of digital media, which eliminates the need for costly physical production and places the power of reproduction and dissemination in the hands of anyone with a computer. It states that the internet is public domain, a concept that's anathema to free market capitalism. You can easily guess which side of the debate Negativland takes up. The essay goes on to outline the history and cultural ramifications of copyright law, from its stifling of ""folk art"" (since folk art is a communal, viral process more concerned with transmission of heritage than singularity) and collage-based art, to the flaws inherent in the record industry's m.o. that make this potentially beneficial development a threat to its sustainability. The essay closes with a clarion call for an expanded, more sensible definition of fair use, one that protects original works from being plagiarized outright and assures that their creators are compensated for them, while decriminalizing derivative works of satire and reinterpretation, thus no longer impeding what has become our era's most vibrant art \xD0 the art of appropriation and collage. As opposed to the didactic nature of the booklet, the audio portion of No Business tends more toward arch satire of the ongoing debate over fair use in digital media, creating a précis of its contradictions and ideological schisms rather than advancing a particular thesis. Some pieces simply intend to display the artistic possibilities inherent in collage, and are more humorous than pedagogical: The title track recasts Ethel Merman's ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" as a tirade against entertainment-industry iniquity instead of a giddy celebration of it, and ""Favorite Things"" rearranges the Julie Andrews classic into an appreciation of the grotesque: ""Wild brown girls tied up in warm strings/ Wild wild white girls that melt into nose cream/ These are a few of my favorite things."" Other pieces delight in the absurd, like ""Piece a Pie"", a mid-century radio drama chopped up into some sort of hellish recursive time loop, like Groundhog Day in a diner. But the album's centerpiece must be ""Downloading"", a long and ominously weighted mash-up of anti-filesharing speeches, Disney's The Little Mermaid (""It won't cost much/ Just your voice!""), and other wildly disparate sources, which seems to intend to limn the urgency and complexity of the debate over filesharing more than to stake out a specific ideological position. The third stage in this three-pronged statement is a whoopee cushion emblazoned with that infamous and iconic ""\xA9"", and perhaps it's this portion of No Business that states Negativland's stance on the issue most clearly: ""THBBBBBBBBBT!""","CD and essay examines the nature of fair use in the internet age.

Geisterfaust,Bohren & Der Club of Gore,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a491b1335d7bf16989c7/1:1/w_160/6d7f99f6.jpg,2005-07-27 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1170-geisterfaust/,Wonder,"If you enjoy it slow and low, Cologne-based Bohren & Der Club Of Gore will very likely do the trick. In fact, with each subsequent release the quintet's ""horror-jazz"" grows increasingly refined (i.e. incredibly fucking spare). And hey, they've been at it awhile: Thorsten Benning, Morten Gass, Reiner Henseleit (who left the band in 1996 and was replaced a year later by the ivory-tickling saxophonist Christoph Clöser) and Robin Rodenberg began playing together in 1988, mining a metallic hardcore sound. Subsequently, as Bohren, they released Gore Motel in 1994, followed by the 2xCD Midnight Radio (1995), Sunset Mission (2000), and Black Earth (2002; reissued on Ipecac in 2004). Bohren's forth studio album, Geisterfaust, is translated from the German as ""Ghost Fist,"" but the five extended pieces feel more like ghostly tip-toes. Admittedly, though, each track's titled with a finger theme, so I suppose my idea wouldn't work. Besides, there's a fistful of heaviness breathing within the airy wraps of bass (kontra, fretless, 8-string), tuba, and bass trombone and the exceedingly spacious Fender Rhodes, sax, and brushed drums. Bohren are often dubbed horror-jazz, though this hardly defines the sound. Consider, maybe, the recent crop of jazz-oriented Rune Grammofon released by Nils Okland and In The Country (featuring Morten Qvenild of the hyperactive Shining) or even something as downcast as non-jazz labelmates Deathprod, then remove 1/2 of the notes and replace any and all folksiness and/or Blue Note overtones with foreboding minimalist dirge and a Sunn 0))) or Khanate streak. Now, mix in some John Cage, because Geisterfaust showcases Bohren as masters of silence, using space and shadows rather than volume increases or additional sounds to create (and maintain) dynamics. The tracks here are all relatively long, but the most expansive in all senses is the grandiloquent 20-minute opener, ""Zeigefinger"" (""Index Finger""), wherein they lug in a tuba and a nine-person choir. The track plods into the starting gate. Pauses continue to grow. Tones sustain miraculously. Voices rise in the background like traces of frozen powder. The drums increase in heaviness, but never break out. It's an appropriate way to start the LP-- you'd be hard-pressed to locate a single riff or roll on the entire album. The three of the remaining pieces-- ""Daumen"" (""Thumb""), ""Ringfinger"", and ""Mittelfinger""-- fall into a similar line, with varying degrees of percussion and bass, and more or less pronounced vibraphone (""Ringfinger,"" for instance, just about establishes a mallet hook). The final composition, ""Kleinerfinger"" (""Pinky"") comes closest to the sound of past releases, a more crumbling ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack on Codeine (band, not drug). But ""Kleinerfinger"" lacks that ineffible heavy feel (background built on octave-downed bass?). It features a steady high-hat and snare rattles like a slow motion whirlpool; there are also beautiful electric piano accents and a smoky saxophone. The most upbeat of the pieces (which isn't saying too much) as well as the most straightforward jazz, it's also the least interesting. Bohren & Der Club Of Gore have been championed regularly (and fervently) by the fine folks at Aquarius Records in San Francisco, and they'd appeal to listeners of black metal as well as drone (Stephen O'Malley gives them props on his website). But for all of that gloom/doom, I could also see them appealing to fans of minimalist ambience and spare electronics, as well those who enjoy adventurous ""out"" jazz. But regardless of your genre identification, you'd do best to turn this up, concentrate, and let it work its way into your head.","Cologne-based quintet recall the recent crop of jazz-oriented Rune Grammofon releases.

"Memory Column: Early Works & Rarities, MCMXCVI-MMIV",Mahogany,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37169fc7814a47cd64e/1:1/w_160/c39c9786.jpg,2005-07-27 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5047-memory-column-early-works-rarities-mcmxcvi-mmiv/,Darla,"My first experience with Mahogany occurred in a loft in Boston's Chinatown. The space was used mainly for showings of independent short films and the band played on the floor with projections behind them, filling the room with their dense, rippling waves of what they refer to as ""massed guitar, violoncelli, voice & electronics."" The moment I remember best was when the band built a monumental drone around a single chord while an image of white metal beams slowly shifted behind them. As the image moved, the texture of the drones shifted, and finally it became clear that the footage was shot on a Ferris wheel, with the camera initially aimed at the direct center of the wheel to create an almost abstract visual. It was an audio-visual feast, to say the least. On record, Mahogany aren't exactly prolific, having released just one full-length in nearly 10 years as a band, but they've turned out a couple more albums' worth of scattered tracks on EPs, split 7""'s, and compilations in that time, which is the stuff Memory Column focuses on over the course of its two discs. Disc One is subtitled ""Song Cycle No. 1 for Rural Michigan"", and the implication is that its 10 songs, recorded from 1996 to 1999, were intended to form a unified body of work, a promise that actually bears itself out pretty well. Disc Two, subtitled ""Song Cycle No. 2 for Detroit & New York"", gathers music from 1999 to 2004 and covers the period during which they relocated from the Motor City to NYC. Generally speaking, these arrangements are more intricate and varied than those on the first disc. Mahogany's music falls broadly into the part of the dream-pop spectrum that emphasizes the dream over the pop, placing them in a similar space with Surface of Ecion, Landing, and Auburn Lull, with whom Mahogany's most-tenured member, Andrew Prinz, has played. Song titles like ""The Singing Arc-Lamp"" do almost as much to explain the sound of the music as I could in 150 words. By the middle of Disc Two, though, the sound begins to branch out, with ""Semaphore Streamlines"" and ""Bunker Soldiers"" embracing a more post-punk sensibility, the latter mixing melodica with bobbing synth and an odd, chanting vocal arrangement that breaks away from the band's more typical wispy harmonies and solo vocals. Those wispy vocals do sound good, though, set in amongst guitars that go on for miles. They give the music's ephemeral arrangements interesting rhythms to play off of, too, laying on a thick, shimmering drone over a delay-drenched ponging noise on ""Amelia No. 2"". A lot of bands playing in this territory have songs that are basically interchangeable, but Mahogany don't fall into that trap-- even their earliest music takes care to introduce counter-melodies and allow the rhythm section (which is sometimes a machine) time to make its own statement. Having all of this music, originally scattered over a collectors' nightmare of rare and hard to find discs, in one place is nice enough from a completist standpoint, but what's more impressive about Memory Column is that it illustrates a band's evolution while also presenting two very cohesive discs that each make a strong statement as suites. People who are into dream pop and classic UK shoegazer rock need to give this band a listen, as they're among the best bands currently doing this stuff, and if Memory Column is any indication, hearing their continued evolution will be a pleasure.","Double-disc collection of EP, 7"", and compilation tracks from the dream pop band, all of which were recorded between 1996 and 2004.

The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw,Pelican,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a0ea9e61561daa4849/1:1/w_160/8be2a3cd.jpg,2005-07-27 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6581-the-fire-in-our-throats-will-beckon-the-thaw/,Hydra Head,"When not outright dismissive, reviews of instrumental rock (a/k/a ""instru-metal"") tend toward the hyperbolic. Maybe the stab at heightened language highlights an attempt to pad the lacking libretto; or perhaps without voices covering-up aspects of the instrumentation, we subconsciously connect the work to pure nonhuman landscapes like towering mountains and multilayered constellations, et al. Whatever the case, the guys of Pelican don't need fancy prose because the Chicago quartet aims for such oxygen-free highs that any over-the-top words I scribble are more or less a reenactment of what they've put to tape. ""Epic"" is the single most overused word in the context of notey crews like Don Caballero (or Battles), Red Sparowes, and Isis: It finds its way into discussion out of habit, but it's hard to prove via any visible calculations what's truly deserving of the descriptor and what's just fucking long. On their sophomore full-length, Pelican certainly know how to go for broke and then continue going and going and going. But are they really worthy of being linked to the Odyssey? Three of the seven tracks here last for more than 10 minutes, one's just under 10, and the other three each tread at around five. In many cases, Pelican enjamb enough dynamic shifts into the compositions to keep things interesting, or at least varied, but I'm still searching for a final explosion. A plus: Unlike many instrumentalists, Pelican don't affix over-long stage-direction-style titles to their compositions. Besides the dorky album title (wait-- you guys never speak, so we're gonna freeze forever? is that the hook?), they let their music do the talking. Song-by-song there's a tendency toward seasonal shifts and the sky: ""Last Day of Winter"", ""Autumn Into Summer"", ""Aurora Borealis"", and ""Sirius"". And while the songs don't necessarily sound like their tags, they at least plant a generality in the listener's head. Those are the structures. It's more difficult explaining exactly what it actually sounds like. For starters, despite critical fixations to the contrary, Fire... isn't very metal. The heavier/murkier debut, Australasia, was certainly within that realm and fit the critical shorthand, but here the production's ultra clean (sorta pristine), the atmosphere's airy (check out those acoustic transitions), and the songs delve into poppier areas than anything they've done in the past. Maybe it's safer to evoke Oren Ambarchi jamming with Trans Am. Coming up with proper genre identification's difficult, but diagramming the specific's of each song's even rougher (cataloguing the twists and turns of each track requires college-level geometry). To speak in the vaguest terms, their attack falls into two over-arching camps: They either riff through those aforementioned ""epics"" or drop-off more incidental sounding shortish pieces. The strongest marathon, ""March Into the Sea"", just under 12 minutes long, is the most ""metal."" There's nimble double bass drum and an interestingly treated cymbal crash. It's less atmospheric than some of the others. The first thought in my head, ""Spacious Fucking Champs."" Late in the track there's a sort of break down into pretty, jangling arpeggios. You know how Slash would always play his solos in the middle of the desert or something during those Guns-n-Roses videos? Well, ""March Into the Sea"" deserves to be unleashed in such extreme conditions. On the other hand, ""Red Ran Amber"", which begins promisingly with patented Unwound-style feedback, wanders into a whirlpool at some point and forgets to re-emerge. Amongst the briefer bits (spaghetti western, underwater surf music), the best (and most surprising) is the untitled fourth piece, a pile of moody acoustic Gypsy strumming with shaker percussion. Here, the instruments feel like they've been lassoed into closer quarters. Queensryche fans might cry ""Silent Lucidity"", but the rest of us will note that toward the end things crackle for a moment and then fingers on strings make discordant noises briefly. If you didn't know better, this might be Espers or Ben Chasny doing the backstroke through tiny wafts of radio fuzz. By and large, Pelican keep things moving. Still, at certain moments my attention wandered and I couldn't help but wonder who would be their ideal singer if they held their own ""Rock Star: INXS"" reality show. Truth is, the attack plateaus here/there, and just then it'd be excellent to introduce a screamer or sigher to push the elements toward that final Wagnarian movement that finds our aching, B-12 deficient hero climbing a mountain to embrase his (or her) too-lost love. My votes: The guys from Mineral and St. Vitus (as a team), King Diamond (solo), the woman in Evanescence, or the father from ""The Sound of Music"". Vocal-free, they never quite pull off that snow-capped climax.","Second album from Chicago's premier instrumetal band.

Once We Were Diamonds EP,Diamond Nights,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbbaeb335119a49ecae2/1:1/w_160/997f117c.jpg,2005-07-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2619-once-we-were-diamonds-ep/,Kemado,"Brooklyn throwback rockers Diamond Nights are the latest cyclical rockers, hoping to woo girls who won't realize their moms were fawning to virtually the same band 25 years ago during REO Speedwagon shows. After the Darkness pecked away at metal-phobic listeners' prejudices, the subsequent carbon-copying of the Cure and Duran Duran decimated listeners' retro barriers, allowing anything sounding dustier than Dad's record collection to seep in. If right now the Killers are trashing Ritz-Carlton suites and spilling Port on their suit jackets, retro-cousins Diamond Nights at least must be leaving candy wrappers on the floor at Best Western. Four of this EP's five offerings are pure frat party filth, cashing in on the reemergence of ""Jessie's Girl"" and ""867-5309/Jenny"" (did they ever go away?) on kegger playlists. ""Dirty Thief"" swipes the chords to ""Just What I Needed"" but forgets the hooks to match, leaving us with an unremarkable tale of heartbreak and rote soloing. ""Saturday Fantastic"" offers much of the same as the band pulls out its beefiest power chords and testosterone-soaked vocals. Amazing to think four years ago these guys would be tarred and feathered by both underground and mainstream critics, no? Before totally denouncing them completely, check opener ""Destination Diamonds"". It's not exactly pushing the envelope, but it's also not jumping up and down screaming ""pick me!"" like so many outlandish revivalists. Frontman Morgan Phalen borrows the verse melody to ""Blinded By the Light"", but fluffy guitar riffs and disarming falsetto puts the diffident, vulnerable spin on arena rock that the Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age so often miss. Unfortunately those slight gains are nullified by Diamond Nights' most vile error-- inexplicably feeling the need to prove they can use synthesizers. ""The Girl's Attractive"" reeks of lechery and tackiness, and the camp is residual on the fist-pumping faux-Rocky montage ""Buddies"". No one's being narrow-minded here, you simply can't just ape your parents' music, pass Go and collect your 200 bucks anymore (OK, I guess you get the money sometimes). Once We Were Diamonds unabashedly sports a caveat emptor, but that's exactly what drunk kids want to pay for when they stumble into Wal-Mart at 2 a.m. anyways, right?","Buzzsaw guitars and 70s arena-pop stylings from Kemado.

As a solo act and with his bevy of talented collaborators, Stewart's sound has encompassed fractured strains of punk, funk, avant dub, free jazz, and dancehall, and has always been infused with his distinctive rabble-rousing politics and an ear uncannily pitched to the perpetual reinventions of street culture. Throughout Stewart's career, he's remained a prescient figure, but his restless, thorny innovations have also likely contributed to the erratic nature of his discography. His recent history is pockmarked by extended stretches of inactivity, and many of his key titles-- including both of the Pop Group's proper studio albums-- are currently out of print in the U.S. So it's surely with this unruly back catalog in mind that Soul Jazz presents Kiss the Future, a concise retrospective that features tasters from nearly every portion of Stewart's career, including several new or previously unreleased tracks. Containing a mere 12 songs, Kiss the Future is more of a strategic strike than a comprehensive introduction, as it represents whole periods of Stewart's career with only a track or two, and ignores some of his albums entirely. And though the set provides a tantalizing, remarkably unified glimpse at some of Stewart's most pioneering work, the collection feels so closely edited that one can't escape the notion that too many choice selections were left abandoned on the cutting room floor. At their hot-wired best, the Pop Group delivered their experimental, roots reggae-inflected polemics with a barbed ferocity unmatched by few peers this side of the Birthday Party. Kiss the Future includes three vintage 1979 Pop Group blasts (""We Are All Prostitutes"", ""She Is Beyond Good and Evil"", ""We Are Time"") that tidily anticipate the moves of contemporary post-punk revivalists from Liars to the Ponys. As with all of this collection's best material, these tracks appear to have aged not a day, which is accentuated by the album's non-chronological running order which places them immediately alongside new cuts like ""Radio Freedom"", Stewart's recent grimy, dubbed-out collaboration with Kevin ""The Bug"" Martin. Other highlights include several pieces by Stewart's excellent post-Pop Group outfit the Maffia, which showcased the original Sugerhill Gang rhythm section of guitarist Skip McDonald, bassist Doug Wimbish, and drummer Keith LeBlanc. On tracks like ""High Ideals and Crazy Dreams"" or ""Hypnotized"" (presented in its 12"" version) the Maffia expel grainy, industrial smears of noise-funk, carrying the type of rugged sonic scars typically associated with a beloved, over-duped cassette tape. Best of all might be ""Jerusalem"", an expressionist, cut-up take on William Blake's traditional tune that features a spectral brass band periodically marching through in a narcotic haze. Like the bulk of Kiss the Future, it's a track that somehow manages to sound simultaneously familiar yet revolutionary (not bad for a nearly 25-year-old recording) and serves to powerfully whet the appetite for the hopefully not-too-distant future when more of Stewart's keenly far-seeing works are once again easier to come by.","Twelve-song Soul Jazz comp traverses the rich career of the former Pop Group singer.

Fraximal,Ferenc,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beb713d197565213b7a1/1:1/w_160/706615f8.jpeg,2005-07-26 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3342-fraximal/,Kompakt,"Hey techno and house dudes, learn to make a fucking album already. I like to bang but so does the bus; drop the snacks and dine me. Vitalic did it; Isolée did it sort of; I like that Schaffhaüser disc nobody talks about too; the boring middle section of the Juan MacLean record's brilliant; Daft Punk tried and failed unadmirably. Maybe albums are aren't your format or whatever-- bullshit. Catch-22 maybe? Am I that much of a bastard? Of course, but Fraximal's plight is understandable. Kompakt's last few artist LPs have had trouble with mid-disc drag and some severe anxiety of influence, i.e. sounding too Kompakt, whatever that means. So we get albums with two or three good tracks and the rest personality- or statement-aspirant duds. Superpitcher, Mayer, Justus-- yeah, you guys, nice try, but what the fuck. So here I am both relieved that Ferenc just made a solid, gimmickless 10-track techno album that just wants to be solid and gimmickless and 10-track, and utterly disappointed that it's merely that. I had the same problem with Allien's newie; Ferenc make better tracks though. Presenting: ""Diplodocus"", which shuffles 2k2 through an ambient X-Filed slush, the fieber kept asteer by bright railroad spike clicks and, if you listen closely enough, an actual melody. That the track starts off the whole album strikes me as defiant and anti-trendy-- this ain't no party, this ain't no disco-- and the next tracks have their own back-to-mine moments too: the raven strings of ""Sandia"", the sub-bass predilection of ""Neng""; the labby tabby rolls of closer ""Acidorro"". If the duo didn't have a history of trendfucked hardcore-can, I wonder whether I'd take Fraximal for the dusty-futuro Nebuchadnezzar mothership it is, or just dusty and a little out of step, like a Matrix reference. The balance tips back and forth most during that middle run from ""Bocaseca 1:0"" to ""France""-- through all is that warp-speed Basic Channel vibe I might have expected out of artists with a more fascist This Is The Real Shit agenda. Ferenc though are just two dudes stuck with a full-length deal, not one for five 12s; their music seems too good-hearted anyway and too merely good for a point, let alone world domination.","Solid, gimmickless techno from the Kompakt duo.

Sybris,Sybris,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b2ea9e61561daa540e/1:1/w_160/858be2d8.jpg,2005-07-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7819-sybris/,Flameshovel,"The ""Alternative"" tag that often pops up in iTunes seems absurdly dated by now, unless you're downloading Pearl Jam records. But it actually fits Sybris, a new band running contrary to several current trends and instead revitalizing the sensibility of 1990s, singer-oriented alterna-rock. Many modern indie bands, from Animal Collective to Architecture in Helsinki, revolve around genre-hopping eclecticism and fluctuating band-member duties-- a denaturing of the band-as-hierarchy aesthetic. Sybris hark back to the Smashing Pumpkins model, when bands were interested in making what we used to call the Unified Statement, not rummaging though through genres like a trunk full of costume jewelry, and when roles were more concrete-- less instrument swapping, more stability. Here in the aughties, we've also seen the regression of the singer-as-driving-force, with more emphasis on whole-band harmonies, multiple singers, and quirky embellishments. Sybris's debut LP is more in the vein of bands that put a charismatic singer in front of strong yet unflashy musicians. The vocals and the music are always clearly demarcated-- while the latter is competent, powerful, and indispensable to the album's success, it maintains a uniform tone that doesn't distract from the centerpiece (vocalist Angela Mullenhour), even at its most thunderous. This singer-first, band-second sensibility, and the consistent temperament of the songs, is what makes Sybris resonate with Life Without Buildings (without the chirruping vocal tics) and Yeah Yeah Yeahs (without the artitude), two other band who updated this same model for the modern setting. ""The Best Day in History in Ever"" opens with a percussive throb and fluid, concise guitar lead that makes one picture Karen O doing judo warm-ups with a mic stand. But this is where the two diverge: Yeah Yeah Yeahs might abruptly ramp the song up to a yowling blues splatter, but Mullenhour puts on her best Edie Brickell coo as her band rolls smoothly through understated dynamic shifts, building incrementally to a thrashing middle section, sinking through a quiet descent, then a upwelling to a mountainous, distortion-drenched re-crescendo. ""You're Only Confident in Your Insecurities"" opens with a fuck-all '90s guitar jangle, then edges crisply to a pop-metal stomp, the music and vocals intensifying as one. Even the coffee-shop strum of ""Blame It on the Baseball"" is made magnetic by Mullenhour's authoritative vocal turn, a blend of raw emotion and melodic control, and by the shimmering, stormy shoegaze it gradually melts into. I like wildly-varied instrumentation and genre-hopping as much as the next musically savvy mid-20s dude. But the stuff can be exhausting, sending me scrambling for a Leonard Cohen comedown. Sybris's long songs, tonal contiguity, deliberate pacing, and infectious melodies are more than pleasant but less than bracing-- just right. They require no palliative counter-measure, and when the disc ends, there's no compulsion to rush to the changer-- why not just let it spin once more?","Sybris' singer-first, band-second sensibility, and consistent sonic temperament are reminiscent of Life Without Buildings and the YYYs.

The Glasgow School,Orange Juice,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4635e6ef95969323a4b/1:1/w_160/c1ecddfc.jpg,2005-07-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6119-the-glasgow-school/,Domino,"In the past year, Orange Juice have enjoyed a well-deserved and long-overdue re-examination. Recent mentions of the early 1980s Scottish band are generally shaped around the notion that they're the most direct ancestor of fellow countrymen Franz Ferdinand, and that they also did bands like Belle and Sebastian no small favors. Some have even suggested that they're one of the key antecedents for the indie pop/rock aesthetic-- in particular, the strain that trades in jangly, shambolic guitars, a healthy obsession with the Velvet Underground, and self-deprecating lyrics. While Mission of Burma and Hüsker Dü were laying the groundwork and setting the bar high for the U.S. indie rock sound and style of the 1980s, Orange Juice and fellow Scots Josef K, Aztec Camera, and the major-label Altered Images were shaping the decade's UK model. The Glasgow School collects Orange Juice's first four singles-- all recorded for Alan Horne's fabled Postcard label-- and what was to be the band's debut LP, Ostrich Churchyard. That album wasn't issued until 1992. Instead, they suffered one of the first indie backlashes when they scrapped that record's low-rent guitar-pop and released a re-recorded and far more polished version of it for major label Polydor. They also got burned in the process when the label selected their Al Green cover ""L.O.V.E. Love"" as a single rather than one of the band's original and more representative compositions. (That Green track would get a second life as a Scots indie pop bellwether almost 20 years later when it inspired the key lyric to Belle and Sebastian's ""Legal Man"".) The pop kid in me slightly favors that Polydor release, You Can't Hide Your Love Forever, which has long been one of my default answers when queried for my favorite album of all time. And yet, The Glasgow School is in many ways a more welcome and fitting introduction to a band whose early, almost uniformly excellent material has not only languished in out-of-print limbo but is difficult to acquire even via file-sharing services. This new Domino compilation is a more complete document and a better re-telling of a story that, if rock's history writers had more imagination, a better ear, and dug further beyond what charted, would rate a few pages rather than a few footnotes. History (and ideas about what's ""important"" or ""seminal"") aside, the main reason this disc is so necessary is because of the songs themselves, nuggets of fey, quirky, smart indie pop. It starts with the band's earliest singles, A- and B-sides laid next to one another. The A's (""Falling and Laughing"", ""Blueboy"", ""Simply Thrilled Honey"", and ""Poor Old Soul [Pt. 1]"") and the standout B-side (""Lovesick"") have a robust charm-- chugging guitars and galloping beats, all played with an innocent enthusiasm and wide-eyed romanticism. Of course, Orange Juice seem as confused about how to go about being pop stars as frontman Edwyn Collins' lyrics can be about how to win girls, but in each case they're so disarmingly charismatic that their faults are forgiven. A pair of rave-up near-instrumentals, the slight, too-precious stumble of ""Breakfast Time"", and a reprisal of ""Poor Old Soul"" that alludes to the Subway Sect's famous lyric, ""We oppose all rock 'n' roll""-- fill out Glasgow's first half. Inspired by punk, incarnations of Orange Juice had existed since 1976, although they approached that Year Zero with constructive rather than destructive tendencies. OJ was buoyed by the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, Subway Sect, etc., and the music press (OJ co-founder Steven Daly first approached Collins while waiting for a schoolbus upon noticing Collins reading an issue of Melody Maker) to go out and do something. ""Leapt onstage, though we couldn't play/ Furthermore, we had nothing to say,"" they claim, but what they shared with Britain's first-wave punks was a desire to democratize the UK music industry and a healthy distrust and disgust toward contemporary and arch-American rock clichés such as blues-based, rootsy guitar. That's not to suggest that OJ weren't students of American culture-- far from it-- but they preferred pre-Beatles or soul-boy models, moving over the course of the 1970s from Teddy Boys to wearing Davy Crockett hats to budget mod looks-- all with an increasing acumen for playing pop with hints of Stax soul and disco. They perfected all of this on their aborted debut, penning ball-of-nerves blends of CBGBs and Studio 54 and effete proto-indie pop alongside the narcotic VU-like ballad ""In a Nutshell"", for which they even (unsuccessfully) approached Nico to provide vocals. Collins himself often wore his broken heart on his sleeve, but unlike other more diaristic or shoulder-slouched writers of his kind (Morrissey, Stuart Murdoch, Sufjan Stevens), he shrugged or laughed off his troubles. Collins' confessionals aren't a liturgy of woes, but of what he may feel is either sage advice or honest self-examination: ""Avoid eye contact at all costs,"" ""Only my dreams satisfy the real beat of my heart,"" ""I'm not afraid of saying I'm close to tears."" Collins' mixture of indie woe and soul/disco sonically matched his desire ""to take the pleasure with the pain""-- he'd already had the pain in his life and songs, why not seek out the pleasure as well? Those instincts peak on ""Consolation Prize"", where unrequited love and the faintest hope of romantic payoff are preferred to moving on, which would potentially mean actually engaging with romance and risking true heartbreak. He attempts the worst serenade this side of Joseph Cotton in The Magnificent Ambersons before almost euphorically admitting, ""I'll never be man enough for you."" Running yourself down never sounded so good.","Long-overdue collection of Orange Juice's shambolic, charming, and seminal Postcard recordings.

Feral Hymns,Lungfish,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda3ea9e61561daa7751/1:1/w_160/a70a2542.jpg,2005-07-25 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4927-feral-hymns/,Dischord,"One of the few remaining survivors from the late-80s Dischord boom that also produced Jawbox, Nation of Ulysses, and Shudder to Think, Lungfish has hardly varied its slow, ruminative style since inception. Feral Hymns isn't about to break the streak-- it's another album of measured, muscular first-wave emo and metaphysical doublespeak from these elder-statesman philosopher punks. The parallel between Lungfish's songs and their career is striking: Both seem like fixed points around which time ebbs and flows, like the tide around the pilings of pier. Their stark, minimal repetitions seemed fresh and dramatic in the varied, exploratory context of late-80s DC punk music. But in 2005, it's beginning to pale-- that same steadfast aesthetic feels more like a creative rut than a statement. It's difficult to chastise Lungfish for repeating themselves, since repetition is their métier; nevertheless, Feral Hymns, while competent, even elegant in its precise intensity, feels tepid and bloodless-- Lungfish being Lungfish without making an effort to advance their craft. All the familiar elements-- the deliberate, stately percussion; the elongated, cyclical riffs; the snarled lyrical tautologies and abstruse involutions-- are all intact. ""All Creation Bows"" lays abstractions like ""Every surface is reflecting/ Every line is intersecting"" into a deep down-tempo groove, and the triumphant unrolling motion of ""You Are the War"" is matched by its mythological pronouncements: ""You are the winged wrist of the sun disk/ You are the first child of ancient slime."" But there's nothing here to urge less fervent fans away from their more energetic and nostalgically charged back catalog. Lungfish is about as far from dancepunk as you can get, yet the core structure of dance music is a good comparison for understanding how they arrive at their sui generis style. Dancepunk usually appropriates the trappings of dance music-- shuffle beats, robotic bass, crisp tempo-changes and dynamic shifts-- and arrays them in serial, song-oriented structures. But what really identifies dance music as such is its structural development: More vertical than lateral, achieved through variations and amplifications on a theme, not concatenated linear progression. This is exactly what Lungfish does with punk music, which is particularly apparent on instrumental tracks like ""Picture Music"". They stretch the basic elements of punk into long, tense arcs, where central themes are tweaked and coaxed through subtle variations. The idea is an interesting one, but even the most unique ideas have a limited shelf-life, and on Feral Hymns, one gets the sense that it's played out its possibilities. It's common to complain of one band sounding too much like another, but Lungfish has fallen into a rarer trap-- they've begun to sound too much like themselves.","Latest record by one of the last holdovers from Dischord's 1980s roster.

Merzbuddha,Merzbow,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44869fc7814a47cd84b/1:1/w_160/8168dd9f.jpg,2005-07-25 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5248-merzbuddha/,Important,"Having heard 15 Merzbow releases give or take, which is probably on the order of 7% of his output, I'm probably not qualified to make any pronouncements about Masami Akita's body of work. But I have heard enough to say that few of the early assumptions I had about his music are true. At first I figured that all his records must essentially sound the same, but it turned out he's probably more eclectic than your average artist. And while I initially had it in my head that noise music is foremost an expression of rage, Merzbow's work runs the emotional gamut. Much of the time, in fact, I would describe it as essentially neutral in terms of affect. As Dominique Leone pointed out in his review of A Taste of Merzbow, ""if any musical fabric binds [his records], it is that of total determination to assault the listener's senses."" Merzbow is essentially a psychedelic artist, attempting to create shifts in consciousness through extreme sound. Using the Merzbow records I know as a barometer, *Merzbuddha is a comparatively stable and measured work. Three long tracks all bear the title ""Mantra"", and the recurring element through each is an ungodly deep and loud three-note bass pulse, around which is wrapped all sorts of whooshing and buzzing noises. I'd heard the whole record via ripped mp3s several times without grasping the full extent of this bottom end; once I finally played the CD on a stereo with a subwoofer as loud as seemed responsible in my apartment building, I developed a completely different understanding of the record. Akita has indicated that he was listening to a great deal of dub around the time he recorded * Merzbuddha, and if that's true this record is another example him taking the core elements of a beloved genre (he's toyed in the past with free jazz and prog samples) and smashing them to barely recognizable pieces in the Merzbow style. Which is not to say that Merzbuddha could ever have you feeling anywhere close to Irie, and god help the person who finds ""Mantra 1"" on the stereo with a head full of THC. Though there are few unpredictable blasts of noise, Merzbuddha suggests more of a simmering paranoia, the ceaseless march of bass suggesting the B-movie monster that manages to keep pace with a fleeing victim despite moving almost in slow motion. There is a lot of steam and hiss throughout, like steam escaping from a coal-belching machine, and the crackles around the bass bring to mind a record stuck in a run-out groove. Only in the last five minutes of this almost hour-long composition does Akita finally remove the governor, letting chaotic sheets of static and ear-splitting metallic scrapes overwhelm the carefully constructed rhythm. Given the title of the album and the series of three ""mantras,"" and given the inside cover photo that shows Akita in a darkened temple kneeling in supplication, we're left to wonder: Is this final assault the sound of enlightenment? Don't know about that, but an hour of good Merzbow, which this is, certainly has a transformative effect.","An almost hour-long composition from Masami Akita.

Are You a Dreamer?,Denison Witmer,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaaeb1335d7bf16996ec/1:1/w_160/7154defd.jpg,2005-07-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8796-are-you-a-dreamer/,Militia Group,"They say all press is good press, but claims that someone is the ""Next Elliott Smith"" are disservice to Denison Witmer. His latest, Are You a Dreamer?, is a fine acoustic singer-songwriter album, but it contains nothing that cuts as close to the bone as Smith's more confessional work. The tracklisting of Witmer's recent covers album, Recovered, better indicates his touchstones: Graham Nash, Jackson Browne, the Band, Big Star... Witmer plays some impossibly gentle country-folk, and Are You a Dreamer? provides more of the same, a far softer and more traditional record than those from Smith or potential points of comparison such as Damien Rice and Sufjan Stevens. However, Stevens is all over this record, playing banjo, organ, even a recorder ensemble on ""Everything But Sleep"". He's just one of many contributors to Dreamer, including Don and Karen Peris of the Innocence Mission and James McAllister on percussion, but it still sounds like a Dension Witmer solo record, just more fully realized. I hesitate to call it a collaborative record, because his contributors so keenly serve Witmer's fragile songs. ""Little Flowers"" starts as basic singer-songwriter coffeehouse fare before Sufjan's banjo, breathy female backing vocals, and a quaint country beat make it into a memorable, but no less gentle, opener. ""Everything But Sleep"" features a recorder ensemble played by Stevens that's one of the album's boldest details, and ""Ringing of the Bell Tower"" matches shuffling drums with Witmer's rustic optimism. The title track makes best use of the contributors, weaving the barest female backing vocals, drums, and clean electric guitar into the song's emotional crests for a lavish but still restrained sound. ""East From West"" plucks along without percussion, as does ""Castle and Cathedral"", a meditation on dreams and photographs. Dreams supposedly drive this album but are only hinted at in its lyrics. It's a uniformly solemn and understated record, and its songs blend together. It's difficult to remember just where one ends and one begins. Partly because Witmer never changes his vocal tone, the songs with the busier arrangements are the ones that stick. It's the first record for Witmer with any kind of push behind it, and he sounds ready: cannily fleshing out his sound with some help from friends, but never losing sight of the style he's honed for years.","Singer-songwriter works with Sufjan Stevens on his latest LP.

Red Hash,Gary Higgins,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c17dea9e61561daa7dbb/1:1/w_160/d49fc7e6.jpg,2005-07-25 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4017-red-hash/,NufusmoonNufusmoon,"When Six Organs of Admittance played Tonic a few months back, Gary Higgins appeared on stage for ""Thicker than a Smokey"", a Higgins track covered on Six Organs' last album, School of the Flower. I assumed Higgins and Ben Chasny would perform together, cross-generation style, but instead the Six Organs leader allowed the elder singer to go it alone. Still sporting a longish red beard with new-found gray, Higgins seemed nervous at first, but once he calmed down and hit a stride, the haunted beauty of the classic loner psych-folk song filled the space like a dusting of incense. Chasny's acquiescence was a touching gesture, especially when considering that it's the Six Organs maestro, along with Drag City's Zach Cowie, who's largely responsible for the reissue of the lost 1973 album, Red Hash, and Higgins' subsequent tour. (School of the Flower issued a missing person request in the liner notes, requesting that anyone with knowledge of Higgins' whereabouts please let Chasny know.) Red Hash was originally released on Higgins' Connecticut-based Nufusmoon Records. Around that time, he was busted for possession of marijuana and spent two years in prison. In his absence, the album sank into oblivion. Mastered from the original tapes with new photos and artwork from Higgins' archives as well as a lyric sheet and two bonus tracks, Red Hash is now available to a wider audience. It's been a good couple of years for once-lost folkies. Comparing Higgins to other formative players in the midst of rebirth, he's darker than Vashti Bunyan or Incredible String Band, less outer-realms and more melodic than Simon Finn. His work could, more or less, be compared to Skip Spence's Oar dressed up like David Crosby. On Red Hash, his guitar and soulsick (but often uplifting) voice are accented with rich cello, piano, organ, mandolin, flute, and bass. The sounds are melancholy but never unaccessible: This is folk both your uncle and WFMU will (and do) love. Coming first, ""Thicker Than a Smokey""'s the strongest composition, a perfect blend of wanderer sadness, transcendent vocals, jangling instrumentation, dour melodies, and a libretto that feels like a Beatnik ""Advice to the Graduate"". Like many of Higgins songs, ""Thicker"" deals with a journey. Beginning with the queries, ""What do you intend to do young man? Where do you intend to go?,"" he delves out homespun advice (""If you travel with a spider/ In your duffle bag/ With you good weather goes"") and personal anecdote (""It's often that I wish to leave myself/ Buy some fancy clothes..."") in a way that connotes something cyclical or unending. Higgins' major themes are travel and lonesomeness. ""Telegraph Towers"" finds the protagonist ""sailin' for home""; only the blowing wind makes him feel like he's not alone. In ""I Can't Sleep at Night"" he's afraid of shut-eye because it might mean death (he smells it everywhere). The mournful ""Windy Child""'s downcast sing-along weds flute, cello, and Higgins' minor chords to ""You were the sun/ And I was the morning dew... / You were always bigger / you were always brighter than me."" The parlor fare of ""Looking For June"" has Higgins joined on vocals with upfront piano for a tale of a solo desert wanderer meeting with camels and the pope (check out the subtle, Eastern vibe). Secondary lyrical fixations include animals, which often signify a lighthearted turn that under closer scrutiny isn't so joyful. There are plenty of birds (and the skies in which they fly), including a cuckoo in the track of the same name. Honing in on Trout Mask Replica, ""Down on the Farm""'s comic protagonist milks a bull instead of a cow. There's also the gently humorous love ballad, ""Stable the Spuds"", but before getting too cozy, note the creepy piano, which trills like descending ice cubes. The most beautiful work outside of ""Thicker than a Smokey"" is ""Unable to Fly"", which is traditional-sounding and pastoral, as if performed by Elliott Smith. (In parts, Higgins adopts a falsetto that sounds torn from Either/Or.) It retells a quest to reach the sun via an Icarus-type flight, but the hero's sent off in a wooden boat (carved by his father) to sail alone on the sea (as instructed by his mother). Before going, he turns in time to see her spread her wings ""to greet the sky so blue"" and fly away. Addressing a lover, he's bummed that know that knows where he's supposed to go, ""You no longer care to know."" He then flies, ""In the golden light of your stare."" Red Hash proper consists of 11 pieces and ends with the aforementioned (Revelations-inspired?) dream quest, ""Looking For June"". Unfortunately, as it often goes with these sorts of reissues, the two bonus tracks aren't as powerful as the others. ""Don't Ya Know"" is an early 80s home recording heavy on the blues and lines about drinking whisky and playing guitar and being a long-hair. (Remember the Five Man Electrical Band via Tesla? that kind of thing...) The more ambitious ""Last Great Sperm Whale""-- a 1975 studio track with bluesy slide guitar and tinny drums-- tells the story of recently freed whale who goes on an oceanic tear until he's recaptured and killed. Likely coming on the heels of Higgins' release from prison, it's a fitting allegorical finale to the reissue, but stylistically it creates a disjunct from the original Red Hash track list. A more fitting end: Last weekend I was at a pot luck and the host put on Red Hash. The first few strums of ""Thicker than a Smokey"" cast a lovely soporific feel over the room before I realized what it was. Commenting on it to my friend, he mentioned that from the pictures accompanying the music, it seems Higgins possesses a certain aura of calm (and there really is a tawny haze around his head in one of the pics). It reminded me of his Tonic performance. After Higgins completed his one-song set, Chasny told the crowd to buy Higgins a beer, but once he finished, he walked back to the bar, somehow ducked out of my sight, and blended silently back into the audience before I could attempt to fulfill the request.","Six Organs' Ben Chasny helps Drag City unearth this 1973 psych-folk album.

Despite a brief return as a pop noisenik/Kevin Shields fanboy with Sugar, the majority of Bob Mould's recorded work has done more to move past this legacy than actively further it. If you're a teenager, you're primed to have your head popped off by Zen Arcade or New Day Rising. If you're inching towards 30, then you're more likely to hear Mould's music introduce ""The Daily Show"" or segue into an NPR news story. And if you're Bob Mould, you're probably splitting time spinning records at DC-area clubs and getting ready to tour behind your supposedly guitar-heavy full-band album, Body of Song. If you're looking for ""Another Good Idea"" (or, God help you, ""Another Celebrated Summer""), then you're better served giving your ""Remaster the SST Catalog"" letter-writing campaign another go. If Body of Song is anything, it's a look back on the neglected portion of Mould's musical career. As Mould phrases it in ""Best Thing""-- ""This would be/ The sound of me/ Looking for some kind of closure."" Of course, if you put an electric guitar in Bob Mould's hands, what gets put to tape will invariably be a rock-like substance. And having Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty in tow definitely helps. ""Always Tomorrow"" actually resembles the sort of slinky, groove-laden, bass-heavy stuff available on recent Fugazi albums, and the storms kicked up by ""Underneath Days"" and ""Beating Heart the Prize"" give Canty a chance to bang to his heart's content. However, when Mould opts to rock out the way he used to-- as on Sugar-lite stuff like ""I Am Vision, I Am Sound"" and ""Missing You""-- the results are less favorable. And, of course, this being a Bob Mould solo album, there are ballads that ably mix Mould's awkward nasal voice with impassioned strumming and sometimes clunky lyricism. ""Days of Rain"" features a few clunkers-- ""If you make it clear/ Doubt will surely disappear""-- but it gets the job done, building gradually to a satisfying rock outro (with the requisite Mould guitar heroics). The disarming ""Gauze of Friendship"" is a more successful endeavor, with Mould keeping the music simple (acoustic guitar, drums, and some cello offered by DC-area musician Amy Domingues) and cutting the fat from his words-- ""He reminds you of a boy you dated once or twice/ Just about the same size /Just about the same eyes/ The only difference being the cadence of his voice."" For the most part, Body of Song offers the expected mix of rock tracks and balladry that one would expect from a Bob Mould solo record. There is one notable exception. ""(Shine Your) Light Love Hope"" is, for all intents and purposes, a dance track. Atop layered guitars and Canty's fervent Saturday night fever, Mould makes like a vocodered disco diva, chanting the song's title in a dreamy, wispy voice. It's unlike anything else in Mould's rock catalog, more reminiscent of the unexpected deviations that peppered his Hüsker-era output (cf. ""99 Ways to Skin a Cat"", ""Reoccurring Dreams""). It's also one of the highlights of his post-Hüsker career, and I don't doubt that Mould agrees-- on the limited-edition bonus disc included with preorders of this album, there are two remixes of ""Light Love Hope"". Longtime fans of the Flying V and the sonic boom could be outraged at Mould betraying his legacy with what they'll perceive as a techno version of ""I Was Made For Loving You"". But no doubt Mould would answer this indignant outrage by telling these so-called fans when and how to kiss his distortion pedals. Press kits and biographies will impress upon readers that Mould's lasting legacy is his part in founding and shaping the fast hard rules of the alternative rock nation, giving voice to a thousand grudging young would-be millionaires that have long since disappeared into cut-out bins. Nearly two decades removed from those iconic days, Mould has amassed a body of work that proves there's something to be said for running a slow and steady race.","The legendary singer and guitarist gets assistance from Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty on his latest release, a mix of slinky rock and able balladry, plus one dance track.

There's a Fire,Longwave,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4dea9e61561daa769a/1:1/w_160/daa5d5c4.gif,2005-07-24 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4847-theres-a-fire/,RCA,"Longwave's Life of the Party EP cautiously explored new avenues, with more ideas in five songs than the band had over the rest of their career. Two of the songs from that EP are re-recorded here, the opening title track and ""We're Not Gonna Crack""-- a sign that Longwave are either self-doubting perfectionists or short on ideas. There's a Fire is an ambitious album-- the kind that wants to be played end-to-end and begs repeated listens to sink in-- but Longwave have a small bag of tricks. The best moments are when they prove what they're already capable of: decent melodies with prominent rhythms and a hint of atmosphere. ""River (Depot Song)"" takes this blueprint and adds a soft falsetto moment between its effect-laden verses; the result is a darker, more dynamic counterpoint to their moderate hit ""Everywhere You Turn"". Frontman Steven Schlitz's voice is limited in range and expressiveness, and he has trouble with U2-aping arena-aiming moments, such as the verses of ""There's a Fire"". Moreover, the weak vocals call further attention to the trite lyrics on songs like the maudlin piano-driven ""The Flood"" or the poppy ""Tell Me I'm Wrong"". Schlitz almost pulls off ""Heart Attack"" with straightforward charm, but when the big guitars come in on the second verse, it becomes a sappy ballad. ""Underworld"" takes an impression of Thom Yorke's falsetto over acoustic plucking and contrasts it with a theme played on bowed, distorted strings. It almost works, but when the same theme reappears in between the maracas-and-angst of another Radiohead-lite moment, ""Down in Here"", it starts to seem like a rope tossed to a song that's going nowhere. Longwave are taking big steps, but not in any new directions. The band still wants to rub shoulders with the its moody English influences, but dabbling in styles you're ill-equipped for, weaving unnecessarily recurring themes into the songs, or piling on incidental effects-pedal sounds for atmosphere aren't going to inherently elevate your music.","Longwave's Life of the Party EP cautiously explored new avenues, with more ideas in five songs than the band ...

Whatever: The 90s Box Set,Various Artists,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d39d034d5c69bf38c5/1:1/w_160/c6d0a6bb.jpg,2005-07-24 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1971-whatever-the-90s-box-set/,Rhino,"Disc 3 track 8: King Missile, ""Detachable Penis""
Disc 3 track 9: Silk, ""Freak Me"" Good God the juvenilia! I was 14 when I first heard ""Detachable Penis,"" and I found it catchy and hilarious enough that my friend Dave and I choreographed a whole geeky ""interpretive"" dance to go with it, which we performed backstage in our high school auditorium for a selection of friends. Later that week, on a late-night bus ride, I split a pair of earbuds with a girl from our audience, listening to the left channel of ""Freak Me"" and touching actual boobs for the first time. This box puts the two tracks together because it thinks it knows me. It can't explain how I managed to touch this girl's boobs even after she'd seen me doing geeky interpretive dances, but whatever: I shouldn't have been touching those particular boobs anyway, and now, whenever I hear Silk's overheated ""wanna lick up you up and down"" come-ons (most recently from a singing homeless guy), I get all sorts of Portnoy's Complaint issues going. Disc 2 track 17: Spin Doctors, ""Little Miss Can't Be Wrong""
Disc 2 track 18: dada, ""Dizz Knee Land"" You think it's totally self-indulgent of me to share my banal high-school memories at the top of this review? Then don't think about buying this box set. Whatever is seven discs and over a hundred dollars' worth of random nostalgia and unflinching faith in the disposable income of formerly middle-class suburban alt-rock kids now around their late twenties. The track selection is specifically designed to let people in this demographic spend 15 minutes going ""oh shit, I remember...and holy shit, lookit, that one video, right...I am Cornholio I need TP for my bunghole...holy fuck ... no MC 900 Foot Jesus?"" All for the last decade during which people relied on ganky old cassette dubs, and therefore don't have ganky old external hard drives to crack open when they want to get Proustian about 4 Non Blondes. Disc 3 track 12: Green Jelly, ""Three Little Pigs""
Disc 3 track 13: Dinosaur Jr., ""Start Choppin"" So what do you want to do: Bask in the warm-fuzzy vibe of shared pop-cultural history or be crushed by the thought that your suburban alt-rock song-memories, and maybe even some of the stories that go with them, are shared by just as massive a cohort as you-- being a child of the nineties and therefore wanting to be ""special""-- always feared? And so long as you're examining your emotions, check this out: How many of the tracks you're excited to see here did you actively despise when they were on your teenage radio? Not yet 30 and already so wistful! Pop culture races along, and here is the ambient sound of your teenage years; I have Big Head Todd like a sepia snapshot of me growing up in Colorado and hating Big Head Todd; do we just buy this now and put it in storage for when we retire? Disc 5 track 14: Better than Ezra, ""Good""
Disc 5 track 15: Blues Traveler, ""Run-Around"" Well no, because Rhino couldn't possibly understand just how special you are, and they're cheating on you with everyone in your age group. The bulk of this set consists of standards and one-hit non-wonders from the mid-nineties flare-of up alternative rock radio, and maybe if you pared that segment down to a couple of discs it'd be a half-decent idea: There's nothing wrong with getting a kick out of hearing Green Jelly or Marcy Playground one last time, but there's certainly something wrong with spending a hundred bucks to do it. Same goes for the subset of perfectly fine, memorable alt-rock singles scattered around, especially in Time-Life infomercial terms: Looking for a way to avoid the expense and headache of tracking down Helmet, Sugar, Juliana Hatfield, and Ash albums? Except: If that's your angle, how much do you really need some C+C Music Factory and Right Said Fred hanging out on the other five discs? How much do you need weirdly placed tracks by Pavement, My Bloody Valentine, and Stereolab, tracks from albums fans mostly bought and still listen to? Is this a recap of alt-rock memories or a Now That's What I Called the Nineties hits compilation or what? By whose estimation, exactly, do quasi-riot-grrrls and Seattle rockers form this much of the nineties history? And why does this listing seem to swing back and forth between ""remember the theme from Friends"" kitsch-stalgia and seemingly trying to tell us that some of these tracks are actually good and important? Disc 6 track 11: Jewel, ""Who Will Save Your Soul""
Disc 6 track 12: Primitive Radio Gods, ""Can You Believe Our Label was Willing to Promote a Song with a Long Stupid Title about a Phone Booth?"" The only thread that really works, in fact, is the carefully selected line of Genuine Chart Hits that Suburban White People Liked then Forgot About. Rhino just happens to assume that somewhere around 1993 you bought a bunch of flannel shirts or striped tights and threw away whichever of your middle-school mix tapes contained ""Walking in Memphis"" and ""Silent Lucidity,"" and after that you thought you were much too cool to buy anything by Des'ree or Deep Blue Something-- and then somehow, by decade's end, you were back to being cool with Shawn Mullins. See? Rhino doesn't know you at all. But you're special to me, and at least if they'd been a little more consistent about the pop streak, we could be listening to Natalie Imbruglia's ""Torn"" right now. Disc 3 track 5: Wreckx-N-Effect, ""Rump Shaker""
Disc 3 track 6: Snow, ""Informer"" Speaking of pop: A quick scan over the track listing might give you the mistaken impression that Rhino have made a half-hearted attempt to get some hip-hop, r&b;, and dance music on here. Turns out there's no ""half"" going on. They've just managed to cull an exact, scientific selection of the particular hip-hop, r&b;, and dance hits that their alt-rock demographic-- hell, their alt-rock demographic's parents-- either liked or can't help remembering. ""Can't Touch This"" is the first track on the first disc, followed by plenty of EMF and Jesus Jones and other things that struck me as sounding ""cool"" and ""different"" on the radio on the way to soccer practice, where-- oh memory!-- a guy named Steve would later sell me all his old Cure and Morrissey albums, because he was getting into Van Halen and trying to pick up chicks. Whatever: from there on it's all En Vogue and Sir Mix-a-Lot and ""O.P.P."" and other things that even people in comas would remember, plus such legends of hip-hop's Golden Age as Kriss Kross, plus stuff like Canadian toaster Snow (whose ""Informer"" video was so popular that MTV put the words and a bouncing ball on screen), jock favorite ""Jump Around"" (by the proud Irish rappers of House of Pain), and, cleverly, DAS EFX, filling the spot you'd think would be reserved for Digable Planets or Arrested Development. Whoomp, there you are, and no Onyx, either: You can get nostalgic for both the alt-rock hits you loved and a few of the pop hits you pretended not to! Plus Boyz II Men. Disc 1 track 2: Sinead O'Connor, ""Nothing Compares 2 U""
Disc 1 track 3: Michael Penn, ""No Myth"" Whatever. I am nothing if not a nostalgist; I have associations for miles and stories to tell; I spent this exact decade in high school and college and the mere track listing of this box makes me want to hunt down old friends. Here is a bunch of stuff I remember, and yet it's not even worth one hundred dollars. Good thing we no longer live in that Time-Life world, that pre-mp3 world where you couldn't possibly track down all these memorable hits; give yourself an afternoon and a copy of iTunes, and you can make your nineties however you like, for memory or for quality or for fun. If all else fails, didn't they just put out My So-Called Life and the first season of The Real World on DVD?","Disc 3 track 8: King Missile, ""Detachable Penis""

Den Gåtfulla Människan,Eric Malmberg,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36369fc7814a47cd62f/1:1/w_160/340ace18.gif,2005-07-24 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5660-den-gatfulla-manniskan/,Häpna,"When Swedish instrumental duo Sagor and Swing broke up last year, the world lost one of the few remaining retro-lounge-prog bands worth more than their weight in kitsch. The band's excellent Orgelplaneten featured the usual roller-rink organ melodies and surf-rock inspired drumming, alongside spacier Moog excursions that somehow never quite sounded like the arcane, gnome hymns you might expect given their proximity to fellow Swedish legend Bo Hansson's classic 1973 Lord of the Rings LP (which you should probably download right now). In fact, Sagor and Swing produced some of the best melodies and mellowest moods this side of Cluster, and I'd mourn their passing a lot more if organist Eric Malmberg hadn't just released his first solo disc, Den Gåtfulla Människan (or ""The Enigmatic Man""). Malmberg was responsible for the melodic half of Sagor and Swing's charm, writing most of the music and performing almost all of it via his trusty Hammond. For some reason, bands stopped playing this instrument despite a whole bunch of cool sound effects and rhythm presets that put most modern synthesizers to shame in terms of warm ambience, and absolutely destroy whole families of Casio sound banks. Den Gåtfulla Människan is a true solo record, eschewing drums or any other sound besides Malmberg's Hammond, but if anti-gravity mood music is your thing, you'll hardly notice the Spartan setup. Melodies ring, echo, and decay like reflections of ice crystals around Saturn; clumpy little drum patterns that sound piped in from Zuckerzeit gallop like analog unicorns under layers of finely aged space dust, the kind for which Tim Gane would probably sell his soul. Like countrymen Dungen, Malmberg's music could just as easily have been recorded 35 years ago as today, and like them, he manages to avoid the pitfalls of mining the past by being a perfectionist: this kind of music doesn't really get much better. The opener ""Det H\x9Agre Medvetandet"" (or ""The Higher Awareness""-- even translated, some of this doesn't really, er, translate, which I guess explains a lot of Abba lyrics) wastes no time in establishing the tone of the record, with a spectral glissando and reverberated triplet-motifs, all of which set up a solemn, almost hymnal melody. The optimistic, misty-eyed phrases sound like the first thing I'd want to hear in the morning, were I waking up in Rivendell. That's right. And Malmberg doesn't let up, as each song segues into the next; out of this mystical den flow the minor key arpeggios of ""Undermedvetandet"", sounding like I've been transported from an elfin parlor to the lunar surface. ""Jaget"" introduces a soft, pitter-patter bossa-beat and a melancholy tune that is vaguely reminiscent of the break in ""A Whiter Shade of Pale""-- though given the organ sounds, that's not very surprising. More likely, this is straight out of Scandinavian folk music, which is often faintly regal, yet colored gray. It's pretty. ""Språk och Tankestrukturer"" features more arpeggios, though faster this time, and a little similar to what Philip Glass used to do before someone convinced him symphonies and soundtracks were cooler than all night concerts in New York lofts. And again, the melodies keep the piece from floating into the stratosphere; Malmberg is always able to ground his music with things you can hum, even as you might feel you're levitating. The closer ""Människan och Evigheten"" does actually drift out to the celestial sea, but not before bathing itself in waves of milk via the drone of overdubbed organs and distant piano figures. True, Den Gåtfulla Människan is drenched in the trippy atmospheres of true blue space music and prog, but it's hardly pretentious or bellowing. Rather, this is the kind of thing that gives good names to organists and gnomes alike.","Formerly one half of Swedish instrumental dup Sagor and Swing, Malmberg unveils a Hammond-only solo LP.

The Upper Cuts,Alan Braxe,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a490b1335d7bf16989c1/1:1/w_160/6e52953a.gif,2005-07-21 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1169-the-upper-cuts/,PIAS,"I'm not ashamed to admit I did a little dance when this turned up in the mail, not because I was holding it in my hands, but because I had no idea it was coming out in the first place. That's sort of how Alan Braxe operates, I guess. Despite making some of the most robust and radiant disco-house of the last decade-- Gallic or otherwise-- he's never seemed to be one for fanfare. In the insular world of French house, he's like a mid-altitude cruiser to Daft Punk's twirling tandem airshow; dependable and always moving, but hardly the type to write his name in the sky. So, some background: Since debuting on Thomas Bangalter's seminal Roulé imprint in 1997, Braxe (real name: Alan Queme) has casually tossed off a series of 12s that hit in the same league as Daft Punk's concurrent singles. But with the possible exception of last year's cokey synth anthem ""Rubicon"" and the definite exception of his co-sign on 1998's ""Music Sounds Better With You"", chances are you won't recognize anything on The Upper Cuts. Even those who do might be caught a bit off guard, because it's easy to lose sight of Braxe's considerable talent when he's only issuing one new thing every six months; this widescreen snapshot of his work makes it impossible to forget just how good he is at what he does. Although billed as the work of Alan Braxe & Friends so as to allow for the inclusion of occasional drop-ins like Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter (with whom Braxe co-produced the aforementioned Stardust track), singer Benjamin Diamond (who sang on it), and little-known French crooner Romuald Louverjon (who comprised the other half of a short-lived outfit called The Paradise), the creative partnership at the heart of The Upper Cuts is between Braxe and bassist Fred Falke. Together, the duo account for seven of the album's 12 tracks, and of those, only 2003's ""Love Lost"" is anything less than thrilling. The rest, from the glinting electro of ""Most Wanted"" to the staccato, fat-bottomed basslines of ""Palladium"" to the defiantly unfashionable 80s guitar peel of ""Rubicon"", stack up one-by-one to mount a pretty convincing case for Braxe as French house's most slept-on producer. In addition to those seven cuts, the asthmatic coo of Paradise's dewey-eyed ""In Love With You"" and the Stardust track (which, I'm happy to say, is still great as ever) The Upper Cuts contains one throwback, one remix, and one misstep. The throwback is Braxe's first ever release, 1997's ""Vertigo"", and although it's dwarfed by his later material, it makes sense here, especially as a curtain closer. The remix is his spangly 2002 disco edit of Shakedown's ""At Night"" which is every bit as strong as his original material. (Braxe's remixing chops don't get often their proper due-- check out his versions of Annie's ""Heartbeat"" and Death From Above 1979's ""Black History Month"" for more.) The misstep is, unfortunately, the compilation's only track from 2005, a Braxe-produced Long Beach g-funk pastiche for a sorta hip-hop artist named Rec. It seems jokey and blunted and woefully out of sync with everything else here, and its presence makes the exclusion of ""Rubicon"" B-side ""Chrystal City"" even more confounding. By this point, though, I'm just tinkering, trying to find a way to make a V-8 supercar run a hundredth of a second faster. When it comes down to it, The Upper Cuts is sleek and inspired and exhilarating, and after nearly a decade, it's nice to have all this stuff in one place. If it can manage to spark some sort of coming out party for Braxe and company over the coming months, even better, although frankly I'll be just as happy to settle for another ""Rubicon"" and a few more Annie remixes.","I'm not ashamed to admit I did a little dance when this turned up in the mail, not because ...

Secret House Against the World,Buck 65,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4285e6ef959693207e5/1:1/w_160/1982c1b3.jpg,2005-07-21 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1070-secret-house-against-the-world/,WEA,"Buck 65 apparently doesn't have to be good-- he's that original. So original, in fact, that his fans overlook his flaws, namely that he's an average emcee and his lyrics can be terrible. For over a decade the Nova Scotia native (née Richard Terfry) has been storytelling in verse over twanged-out beats. This stylistic donnybrook-- one of hip-hop's most distinctive-- has been met with equal parts approbation and bafflement. To some, he's the Johnny Cash of hip-hop; to others, a kitsch novelty act. (He's neither.) Early Buck albums had all the professionalism of a late-night weed experiment, but Terfry is growin' up and it shows. On career retrospective/archaeological dig This Right Here Is Buck 65, released in January, lyrics were revised and songs re-recorded. Charmers like ""my cock is so big and the end of it glistens"" (from ""The Centaur"") became ""my clock is so clean and the hour-hand is missing."" Does vocal repentance make Buck's stuff more palatable? Not really, but it does enable us to take the emcee (slightly) more seriously. Secret House Against the World, Buck's first album of entirely new material since 2003's Talkin' Honky Blues, switch hits: The beats now belie the seriousness of the lyrics, if anything. Sometimes moods meet up and the result is moving: Pedal steel (always sad), marimba, and a narcotically lugubrious acoustic guitar underpin Buck's gruff lamentations on ""The Suffering Machine"". But on balance he seems out to prove his sadness runs deeper than even music can convey. And damn, his music can be some sad-sack shit. The droopiest numbers are thankfully spaced out, in addition to being somewhat spaced-out. ""Corrugated Tin Facade"" opines, ""nothing's more beautiful than a woman's tears,"" over a burbling synth spread that might get Jóhann Jóhannsson to rap. Like ""Surrender to Strangeness"", which pits elder statesman cello against an electronic beat, the song would be more beautiful without Buck's lyrics, but not necessarily better. It's refreshing to hear Buck deliver over a non-dirgeful backdrop. The sadder beats amplify his flaws and push his style over the top, making his funereal drawl seem farcical. On ""Blood of a Young Wolf"" he's unpleasantly robotic, evoking black-on-the-inside mallcore frontmen more than any American folk icon. It's possible dude's voice has dropped a couple semitones since recording his first EP in 1992, but c'mon. I don't think even Beck's gravelly monotone has ever sounded as silly as his consonant peer's on ""Kennedy Killed the Hat"". The less overtly downtrodden backings offer more proper sympathy. ""Le 65isme"", which features a stripped-down beat of live drum kit, martial bass and a few snappy guitar notes, fares much better. The mood is dark (of course) but hardly sentimental. Buck gives the refrain (""sex... cinema... politique"") a blunt, Shatner-esque reading. In the past Buck seemed unsure of how to spit over his most country-flavored beats; here he's completely at ease. ""The Suffering Machine"" sounds suspiciously like ""Phil""-- one of three new cuts on This Right Here-- but this time Buck lets the words come slowly, making room for the scruffily beautiful music. Similarly poised is ""Drunk Without Driving"", which presents a techier variant on more straight-strutting twang jobs like opener ""Roughhouse Blues"". In underground hip-hop, whose artists and fans bitch incessantly about authenticity, it's awesome that one of the artists with the most cred is a white guy from Nova Scotia who wears a trucker hat (check the website photos). Seven albums into his career, Richard Terfry has stayed as distinctive, and consistent, as anyone. Now he finally seems to be making a home of his hodgepodge.","Buck 65 apparently doesn't have to be good-- he's that original. So original, in\n\ fact, that his ...

When I was forced to attend, I spent my own time there faking seizures and trying to talk to girls. Such was the leniency of the Presbyterian Church. Maybe the term means something different in Youth Group's home country of Australia, as the band are neither that fun nor that painful (respectively). They aren't that anything, really. The best thing I can say about Youth Group is that if there's a difference between merely average and painfully mediocre, Skeleton Jar is on the upswing of that curve. Singer Toby Martins' voice is reminiscent of James' Tim Booth, expressive but without quite the same range or control. Couple his mannered delivery with basic, sing-song melodies, and add them to predictable progressions and dull rhythms, and there isn't much about Skeleton Jar to recommend. The album is dominated by guitars playing droning arpeggios in tick-tock rhythms, cranking up the distortion just as the chorus approaches like a tired employee punching in for work. Songs like ""See-Saw"" appropriate slow indie pop jangle much the way Death Cab for Cutie once did, though it becomes a limp power ballad by the chorus. ""Baby Body"" is a step in the right direction, at least compared to the rest of the record. Beginning with acoustic plucking and the soft pounding of the bass drum, it shifts dynamics and adds some spirit to their performance for the second verse. However, hit the pause button before then, and you could probably sing the simple chorus melody before you even hear it. While they avoid slipping into cringing emo, they could take a moment or two to actually emote, as they do on the album's closer, ""Piece of Wood"". Skeleton Jar gives a clear blueprint of what the band wants to sound like, but adds nothing unexpected to the formula. The album's biggest surprise is that it was released by Epitaph, who went so far as to slap a quote from Death Cab guitarist and producer Chris Walla on the album's front sticker. To whit: Skeleton Jar is ""sweet and dear in a world stolen by cynics""; ""cynics"" likely encompassing critics trying to review the album honestly, and also that, ""If you don't love them, your heart is dead."" Could you please put a more original record in my heart's coffin before you nail it shut and push it out to sea? Thanks, Chris.","Epitaph release from the DCFC-approved indie pop group.

Little Chills,Darren Hanlon,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c17babf31b7dc715661d/1:1/w_160/a5318fcf.jpg,2005-07-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4015-little-chills/,Candle,"Former fourth Lucksmith and ex-Simpletons guitarist Darren Hanlon understands that the difference between simple and simple-headed is, quite literally, wit. Like his aforementioned countryfolk, the longtime Australian musician has a knack for quirky tunefulness, good-naturedly ambitious rhymes and tingly everyday details, shared over shopworn guitars and embellished with piano, violin or the occasional toy instrument. For his second solo album, Little Chills, Hanlon soft-focuses on another set of unembarrassed odes to simple pleasures, this time with knob-twiddling from Calexico producer Craig Schumacher. Hanlon revels in the mundane with the childish exuberance of Jonathan Richman. On one of the album's punkier tracks, Hanlon laments the dearth of songs about his favorite indoor sport: ""Can't some DJ play a squash song in their bracket?"" he asks. He indulges in Lucksmithian weather puns on ""Winter Takes Fall"", starting the day in shorts but ""having second thoughts"" (the accent makes the rhyme, natch). He visits every train station in town. He loves vinyl-shopping so much he almost spoils the album with cliché-- ""your life's a film, who writes the score?""-- before redeeming himself with a panoptic closing incantation, ""The record stays still/ While the world revolves around it."" The goosebumps of real-life romance have been a Hanlon theme dating back to dizzy, banjo-laden 2000 hit ""Falling Aeroplanes"". It's been 21 years since Billy Bragg released ""A New England"", but Hanlon's love songs still echo his former tourmate's cleverness, if not his righteous indignation. On ""A to Z"", the clear choice for first single, Hanlon asks his sweetie to read him all the names in the phone book-- ""both Christian and sur-""-- and sing ""the entire Beatles Anthology/ From 'All My Loving' to 'Yellow Submarine'"". Any quibbles over his exclusion of John Lennon's Brian Epstein portrait (plus, bloody ""Yesterday""!) would miss the point. Then ""I Wish That I Was Beautiful for You"" averts its own potential cheesiness with vivid specificity: ""It looked as though the highway wore eyeliner,"" Hanlon murmurs. For all his aw-shucks regular-guyness, though, it's Hanlon's oddities that-- as he himself might rhyme-- make his quiddity. It's the thrash coda of heavy-metal T-shirt memento ""Brooklyn Bridge"", the perversely slow and distant opener ""Wrong Turn"", the ""half a dozen eggplants/ Or six aubergines"". It's the self-abbreviating party ruckus in ""The Unmade Bed"", followed by Hanlon's simple, witty mission statement: ""These are my principles/ If you don't like them I've got others/ This is my opinion/ If you don't agree, I've got big brothers.""","Latest release from the former fourth Lucksmith.

Vol. 1,Meredith Bragg and The Terminals,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48ec0084474cd0c04fc/1:1/w_160/3b23e645.jpg,2005-07-21 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1167-vol-1/,Kora,"I hear the ghost of Elliott Smith haunting Meredith Bragg's debut-- especially on ""Work and Winter"", where the semblance is uncanny. Over a gently strummed guitar and gently tapped triangle, the former Speedwell member arcs his whispery voice across a plaintive melody, enunciating higher notes for a lyrical phrase before descending again to a more comfortable range. Singing just above his natural level, Bragg crafts the tune and the performance for maximum poignancy. It's the work of a bright student: a little self-conscious and overeager, but nevertheless affecting. On the other hand, the lyrics on ""Work and Winter"" are particularly Gibbardesque: ""Smiling as I felt your breathing align/ In alliance with mine."" It would be a little rash to dismiss Bragg and his Terminals as just another troupe of pop-sensitive, heart-on-sleeve folkies. Admittedly, most of Vol. 1 draws heavily from obvious sources, and most of the ideas here will be familiar to anyone who's heard Nick Drake, Death Cab for Cutie, or the New Year. And yes, the album's aesthetic of failure-- its tendency toward extreme self-reckoning-- derives from Smith's canon of introverted and expressive songs. However, despite these influences and even despite its Decemberistical album art, Vol. 1 transcends any accusation of imitation: These 11 tracks have their own high stakes and dire consequences and seem as specific to Bragg himself as Smith's were to him, as Gibbard's are to him. Instead of mining Smith's sense of self-compromise or entertaining the DCFC frontman's romantic whimsy, Bragg writes lyrics that are more plainspoken and austere in their jadedness. He's wary of relationships on the bare-bones ""Early Sign"", surprised that he can be guardedly hopeful on ""Carolina"", and, over uncorrected guitar flubs, sweetly reminiscent on ""Seventeen"". All of this introspection is couched in music that is at once intimate yet expansive, concise yet darkly atmospheric, understated yet occasionally powerful. Bragg sings in a soft voice, carefully enunciating his syllables as if uncertain he'll be understood. Only when he alters his voice for ""Waltz No. 1"" does the album falter, but elsewhere his risks pay off. Bragg spends half of the seven-and-a-half-minute ""I Won't Let You Down"" half-humming the short melody over and over, stoically building to something uncertain yet ineluctable. That ""I Won't Let You Down"" sounds so confident and immediate is not just to Bragg's credit, but also to the credit of the Terminals, who prevent Vol. 1 from descending gravitationally into dreariness. Jonathan Roth's drums propel the melodies and anchor Bragg to the world, while Elizabeth Olson's cello adds tremulous gravity to tracks like the short ""Before the Storm"" and ""Bitter at Best"". But it's Brian Minter who adds most to the band's sound and helps make it distinct from their forebears. His piano makes a perfect foil for Bragg's mechanistic guitar rhythms on the propulsive closer, ""Shattering"", and his ""Vibraphonic Devices"" evoke a noir chiaroscuro on the dark ""My Own Worst Enemy"". Bragg and the Terminals may not have pioneered their sound, but they sound perfectly at home all the same.","Former Speedwell member's solo debut is hauntingly reminiscent of the work of Elliott Smith.

Home Sweet Home,Kano,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc49eb335119a49ecc25/1:1/w_160/66b7ec57.jpg,2005-07-20 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4598-home-sweet-home/,679,"Crime rhymes with another one-word player in the blogs 'n' crits Simon-says name game and, as usual, nobody's really winning. ""Whatcha call it, grime?/ Call it what ya wanna call it, I'm fine,"" scoffs the serenely confident Kane Robinson on ""Mic Check"", one of many decidedly (un)grime tracks on the 20-year-old prodigy's debut album. If g**** is now understood to be everything British, brutish, blackish, hollered, squawking, Dizzeed, manic, squelching, and/or Wiled out, this would-be ambassador is running off the genre's pot-holed backroads onto freshly rolled-over blacktop that's still steaming in its stealth smoothness. Instead of clobbering like a cracked-up Thing popping Pow! pills, this East London MC nightcrawls through the shadows, slipping deep lyrical daggers over beats that are meticulously polished, waxed, and primed to play mirror to Kano's steep autobiographical musings. A fierce student of both hyper-speed UK beat styles and (gasp!) American hip-hop, this doe-eyed poster boy's intrinsic influences are often bore out by an uncanny camou-flow that slyly adapts to Home Sweet Home's varied sonic textures. ""If it's a good flow, it must be Kane,"" he brags, expertly utilizing the naturally egomaniacal third person. Luckily, unlike many delusional, self-satisfied young crowers, Kano offers enough solid evidence of his vocal dexterity to make Matlock blush. While recent breakouts like the Game rep their idols with simple ad nauseam shout-outs, Kano's nods are more intrinsic to his rhyming style. Though it's nearly ruined by a cringe-worthy, Black Sabbath-sampling chorus, the clipped-guitar ""99 Problems"" Jr. scuff-up ""I Don't Know Why"" finds the MC acutely aping Jay-Z's Blueprint-era cadence (along with a couple Oompa Loompa-esque sing-song lines) as he lands pretty-boy punches with a knowing grin. The album's lead-off title track showcases his roided-chameleon adaptability as he eases listeners into his wordy realm by initially winding-up with a slow, off-kilter flow before gunning in-the-pocket fastballs all over the track's airtight electronic playing field, courtesy of frequent collaborator Mikey J. Produced by famed world traveler Diplo, the frighteningly impressive ""Reload It"" provides a living, breathing drum 'n' bass gauntlet that Kano duly annihilates as it skips between double-time snare-snap and ambling, woozy wobble. With guest shots from Ritalin-defying mic sharks Demon and D Double E, the track also offers a crystalline illustration of why Kano's trans-Atlantic potential is off the charts: Relative to his peers' slang-slinging verbal zig-zags, Kano's immaculate enunciation and unruffled demeanor are easily deciphered without a gully-made RWD decoder ring. Not to say his wordplay and content are simple. Along with a wide-range of production styles and multi-flow grandstanding comes an equally assorted thematic breadth. Whether he's bitching-out brut bouncers with verbal assaults (""Typical Me""), ruminating on teenage love (the Streets-produced ""Nite Nite""), calling-out closed-minded youths (""Nobody Don't Dance No More""), offering a mega-ton boast-a-thon (the already classic ""P's & Q's""), or just getting his Hennessy on (""Remember Me""), Kano injects nearly every track on Home with refreshing depth. Backed by luscious wind-chimes and chipmunk squeal vox samples, the lovey-dovey ""Brown Eyes"", with its not-so-romantic refrain of ""I don't want to fall in love,"" is noticeably more conflicted and realistic than your typical female-demo pandering fare. Stellar album cuts like the introspective stunner ""Sometimes"" see Kano tempering his encroaching stardom with second-thoughts. ""When they say I'm the next one to blow I say why do they think me,"" he admits, ""All I do is stay in mostly and sleep/ And all I do is watch Channel U and drink tea/ Why me?"" He combats such internal struggles with staggering maturity and an appealing, hard-working sense of earning ends on his own terms. ""The hood think I'm signed, they like 'I swear he is'/ But I'm still in the grind writing lines all day, every night,"" he insists with focused intensity and ghetto guilt on the blue-collar anthem ""9 to 5"", taking absolutely nothing in his life for granted. Such striving, self-motivational forces are no stronger than on ""Signs of Life"", a six-minute-plus cautionary tale marked by arch strings and doom-boom sci-fi bass. Crushing the easy-made glorification of hip-hop's drug-slinging stereotype, he points a clenched fist at a locked-in bruva: ""You ain't so rich now/ I bet you feel like a prick now/ Cause where's all your fancy shit now/ Where's your whips, chicks, and your bits now/ Shit, you should have fixed up/ Fuck drugs, the mic you should've picked up/ And it was all for big bucks, now your sittin' in a cell doing sit-ups."" Kano doesn't just defy the sonic tradition of grime on Home Sweet Home, he defies the tidy boxes MCs are usually plopped in upon their arrival. ""I'll never have a calm day's rest until my album's in stores next to Kanye West,"" he claims, and though the likelihood of a record store sorting their wares by first name seems slim, the two MCs do share an urge for multiplicity. Laying down roads every which way, this nimble artist's future destination is promising and unpredictable: No matter what happens to grime, Kano is poised to endure.","Crime rhymes with another one-word player in the blogs 'n' crits Simon-says name game and, as usual, nobody's really ...

Miasma,The Black Dahlia Murder,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48dc0084474cd0c04f9/1:1/w_160/584bfd07.jpg,2005-07-20 05:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1166-miasma/,Metal Blade,"The Black Dahlia Murder took their name from a classic Los Angeles crime story. In January of 1947, Elizabeth Short, a 22-year-old aspiring actress, was found in a vacant lot just outside Hollywood. Her body was bruised, abused, and literally cut in half. Journalists took to calling her the Black Dahlia-- possibly because of her supposed penchant for wearing all black to garner attention from men-- and her killer was never found. It's one of the more gruesome crimes in the long sordid history of Hollywood. The band didn't originate in that city, though. But it only seems fitting that they instead exploded onto the U.S. metal scene from Detroit, Mich. It may be over 2,000 miles from where Short's murder occurred, but Detroit-- with its vacant buildings, high crime rate, and low incomesy-- is a perfect fit for the barrage of anger and desperation of Miasma, the band's sophomore release. The Black Dahlia Murder combine elements of melodic Scandinavian death and black metal bands with the more straightforward style apparent in classic Florida death metal. All of the superfluous elements have been excised-- there are no brooding, operatic keyboards, no triumphant, clean-vocal choruses. Instead, the band shifts from one furious riff to the next, and vocalist Trevor Strnad mixes things up by switching from deep death-influenced growls to a high-pitched rasp. The guitars seem to feed each other, and the dual harmonies between the two are one of the bands strongest assets. The pummeling, mid-tempo instrumental ""Built for Sin"" leads into the galloping ""I'm Charming"", and the band doesn't really let up again until the disc's end. New drummer Zach Gibson keeps the band rolling at an uncompromising pace, and yet things never get boring. While so many death metal bands are content to ride the blast beat 24/7, Gibson mixes things up quite a bit. In ""Statutory Ape"", for example, he switches from one rapid-fire-beat to another throughout, rarely easing up on the snare, yet he still finds plenty of time to abuse the bass drum every now and then for good measure. Overall, the band should be commended for taking a form that is becoming increasingly derivative and making it seem fresh. There are plenty of comparisons that can be made (as many reviews of the band's work will prove), but there isn't a single moment of Miasma that feels borrowed, forced, or copied. From the lyrical tone-- which spends plenty of time in the dark and violent, but never has to rely on the Satan-laden macabre-- to the fast-and-insanely-furious riffage, the record stands as a testament to powerful modern metal, with a nod towards the past and an eye towards the future.","The Black Dahlia Murder took their name from a classic Los Angeles crime story.

Victim of Space,Metalux,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36169fc7814a47cd629/1:1/w_160/21c37285.jpg,2005-07-20 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5658-victim-of-space/,5RC,"Victim of Space is Metalux's first album for 5 Rue Christine, following releases on specialty noise labels Hanson and Load in addition to several self-issued CD-Rs. Any time spent worrying that this latest label switch might blunt the female duo's anarchic onslaught, however, is evidently time that should've been used more constructively, as these eight tracks-- whose 33-minute running time straddles the blurry line separating EP from LP-- comprise some of the twosome's spiniest, least-embraceable material yet. Using a rapidly decaying assortment of analog electronics, inflamed guitars, splintered tape loops, and inscrutable vocals, the veteran duo of M.V. Carbon and J. Gräf belong to the growing contingent of noise peddlers whose work bears ever less direct relation to standardized rock-based (or jazz, or electronic) forms. While portions of their 2004 Load album Waiting for Armadillo occasionally alluded to traceable forward-moving rhythms and brooding No Wave song structures, here Metalux present their unstable sonic collages in an even further advanced state of decomposition, showing little regard for listener comfort or comprehension. The mysteries begin right there in the title: what Victim, of what Space? Clearly Metalux do not intend to portray themselves as mere victims (or bystanders) of their art, as throughout the album the two serve as willful agents of their music's constant mutation, sculpting their sound as forcibly as any act inside or out of the noise beehive. Theirs is an inorganic science; the album's short attentioned anti-grooves feel ungoverned by precision or continuity, and so bear little resemblance to more drone-centric peers like Double Leopards, the locomotive pummel of Lightening Bolt or even the prolonged disrepair of a typically patterned Wolf Eyes composition. ""Sunny Krakow"", which matches distorted punk vocals to unanchored Harry Pussy-ish guitar, is about as familiar as Metalux is willing to get here, as the vocals dare an almost-melodic hook or two before the guitar scrabbles noisily away over the rocks. Likewise ""Tremor Loss"" begins with a rather refined patch of (what sounds like) harpsichord until legions of tiny, insect-like sounds swarm to nibble the piece to confetti. Throughout the length of theatrical cuts like ""Shipwreck"" or ""Shelldrum"", Carbon and Gräf are stubbornly reluctant to allow their audience to become attached to any one noise, creating instead an ever-shifting mosaic of serrated fragments beneath their cryptic, always-just-shy-of-earshot lyrics. As compelling and curiously unknowable on 10th listen as on the first, it doesn't take much time spent with Victim of Space before you might begin to suspect that the true object of its title is the person sitting in your chair, listening to your stereo.","The noise band's first album for 5 Rue Christine, following releases on Hanson and Load in addition to several self-issued CD-Rs.

A User's Guide to They Might Be Giants,They Might Be Giants,by: Stephen M.

Does the world really need another summation of Johns Flansburgh and Linnell's career? Actually, yes. User's Guide has a few advantages over its predecessors: by benefit of its timing, it's much broader and perhaps more representative of their two decades of prodigious output. Furthermore, by virtue of its defining concept, it avoids the obvious chronological presentation of singles and shoulda-been hits in favor of a much more playful overview whose organization reflects the Johns' guiding whimsy. Song length-- not history or popularity-- informs the order of the generous tracklist. Beginning with the 47 seconds of ""Minimum Wage"", the tracks get increasingly lengthy, peaking with the 12th song, ""Guitar"", which clocks in at nearly four minutes; the remaining tracks get progressively shorter until the 51-second ""Spider"" closes the compilation out. The packaging cleverly plays out this highly ordered approach: the sleeve contains ""A Fairly Complete List of They Might Be Giants Gigs Since 1985*"" (""*1982-84 have yet to be documented"") along with a timeline, a list of presidents mentioned over two decades, and a ""comparison chart of personal pronouns in TMBG song titles."" The cover art is derived from the UPC bar code, which expands to dominate the cover art and purports to measure melody, fidelity, and quantity. It's a sly reversal of the typical best-of aesthetic. Instead of presenting disparate material as a holistic statement of artistic intent and accomplishment, User's Guide explicitly acknowledges its commercial aims: These 29 songs are simply subjects from which variable data can be gathered, analyzed, and graphed. And sold. While there are some curious omissions (where's ""(She Was a) Hotel Detective""?), the tracklist proves that Flansburgh and Linnell never lost their gifts for quirky and complex pop hooks, as evidenced by late-career highlights like ""Cyclops Rock"" and ""Doctor Worm"". However, songs like ""James K. Polk"" reveal a tendency toward humorless overliteralization of history; ""Meet James Ensor"" and the subtext-heavy ""Purple Toupee"", on the other hand, exposes a tendency toward the opposite. However, a statistical analysis reveals more than just the band's prolificity and diversity of output. User's Guide collects five tracks from the well-selling Flood (1990); four from Apollo 18 (1992); and three songs each from the band's self-titled debut (1986) and breakthrough Lincoln (1988), as well as from their recent children's album No! (2002). All in all, 18 of the 29 tracks date from the period 1985-1994, whereas only 11 are from 1995-2004/5; TMBG cull more tracks from the fewer albums in 1985-1994 and fewer tracks from the greater number of albums in 1995-2004/5. While these figures may seem slightly tedious presented here, they prove scientifically what many listeners have long asserted, at least beginning with Apollo 18-- the first decade of They Might Be Giants' career produced an abundance of quality material (see: ""Ana Ng"" and ""She's an Angel""), but the second decade of their career has seen an appreciable decline in that quality (see: ""Boss of Me"" and ""James K. Polk""). This slippage could be attributed to the mid-90s post-grunge hostility to levity and quirk or perhaps to They Might Be Giants' transformation from a duo into a full band, which expanded their range beyond their charm. That's only subjective speculation, though. User's Guide seems to be an honest acknowledgement of the band's falterings as well as an implicit promise to keep playing around.","The fifth TMBG retrospective is also the most useful.

Gravity's a Bitch,The Starvations,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a556b1335d7bf1698b91/1:1/w_160/b064654c.jpg,2005-07-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7484-gravitys-a-bitch/,GSL,"The Starvations are a band out of time. While their third record finds their sloppy bar-rock tightened up a bit, there's still nothing on it that would tip off an unwary listener that it wasn't recorded between 1977 and 1983. These dates are commemorated on Family Recordings's recent New Waves compilation as the bookends of the halcyon days of post-punk and new wave. But all trends have shadow-trends beneath them, and in this case, the term ""shadow"" couldn't be more appropriate. The Starvations is the bastard scion of two gothic punk-noir bands, each of which formed in '77 and disbanded in '83: The Birthday Party and the Misfits. Blending the druggy storytelling and inebriated, throttled vocals of the former with the overstated morbidity and sloppy energy of the latter (with an L.A.-centric nod to the psychodrama of X, another band that formed in '77 and, while they didn't disband, began turning away from gut-wrenching punk and toward rootsy eclecticism around '83), the Starvations' unreconstructed take on classic L.A. punk is consistently exhilarating. If modern L.A. spawns more materialistic pop-punk and less of the bohemian underbelly-trawling favored by the indelible X, then the closest the Starvations come to modernity is on the first and last tracks of Gravity's a Bitch. Both are strong, and neither cedes too much aesthetic ground to the slickster zeitgeist, they're just sleeker, smoother rides than the unruly dirges that divide them. Opener ""The Rising Horizon"" begins as a clipped, anthemic stomp, then blurs into a slashing glide during the verses, and finds Gabriel Hart reprising his constant themes of dopesick love and inevitable decline. Trudging across quicksand that represents both the downward pull of horse (""And I walked/ And I sunk/ Severed my limbs/ Swimming in junk"") and of unrequited love, Hart also acknowledges the darkly romantic magnetism of such dire circumstances: ""And it never rains here but I won't complain/ Who'd ever want to wash away all the pretty stains?"" The title track closes the record with a stylized flourish: A cool wash of melodic bass, shushing percussion and quietly ringing guitars allow Hart's voice more space to breathe than usual, before the song revs up with chugging chords and flecks of detuned piano. A bleak terrain unfolds between these two landmarks: The funereal drums and wobbly arpeggios of the teen-angst dirge ""Purgatory"" (""We're slowly decaying into our parents/ Frigid and soulless and co-dependent""); the damaged surf-rock and call-and-response shouts of ""Where was I?""; and the literally opiated spaghetti-western theme ""This Poison"". By addressing the vices of junk, booze, and love with equal desperation, the Starvations have a little fix for everybody.","GSL band blends the druggy storytelling and inebriated, throttled vocals of the Birthday Party with the overstated morbidity and sloppy energy of the Misfits.

Jones...all or some of which might be the same people) co-owned house music in 2004 with Tiefschwarz and Blackstrobe. Like the Frenchmen, they restored Brutish physicality to an underground house scene that had pushed clicks and pops about as far as they could go. But where Tiefschwarz stuffed their famed remixes with details, GPM tracks favored simple, crisp rhythms á la Metro Area and unadorned electro basslines. And where Blackstrobe oozed throwback EBM attitude and campy menace, GPM was almost friendly, nearly lush. The result was straight up enough to pull those who don't give a shit about microhouse and just subtle enough to pull those who do. Their second anniversary mix CD is probably the one record we'll point to in a decade to say ""that was house in 2004."" Like many electrohouse pioneers, GPM has felt the pull back to house of more micro-proportions. Clubland boundaries are being upended all over the place this year, from Sasha and Digweed caning Kompakt, to Villalobos' omnipresence (everywhere except his club dates), to Isolée being the toast of all the rock mags (and, ahem, websites). ""Nerd house"" has almost achieved equal footing with prog trance, mostly since the international club circuit is coughing up blood. (Alternatively, and more frighteningly for some, there was never any difference between them except scale of economics.) Unlike the GPM Second Anniversary Mix, which had the cohesion of any mix builty of entirely out of the catalog of a strong label, Body Language strays further afield, sometimes deeper, sometimes more revelatory, but rarely as fun. Opening with a few tracks of clicks and cuts and a DJ trying to remember the names of all the Isley Brothers, trunks are finally rattling with the bass and nasty sand dune riffs of Booka Shade's ""Panoramic"". As the bass grumbles and glowers, Marlow's ""Quiet"" patterns some delicate vocal science (a cheap route to ecstasy that works every time) before the banging drums of Marc Houle's ""Has to Do"" brings a bit of needed earthiness to all those half-breaths and chipped syllables. Guido Schneider's remix of Dub Kult's ""Bip"" has buried handclaps and scatting vocals dipped in heavy-echo syrup. There's a long stretch of 80s revivalism leaning hard on the arpeggiation, be it Depeche Mode (Sterac Electronic's ""Destination Reached"") or Vangelis (Hans-Peter Lindstrom's ""I Feel Space"", which throws in some tribal house bongos for the hell of it). Francisco's ""Moon Roller"" applies Erasure melodies to Superpitcher drums, and Tiefschwarz's ""Isst"" brings the fat, farting Mylo-esque bass and cymbal crashes. ""Ball of Light"" is more so-clean-you-could-eat-off-it, immaculately produced tech-house from Mathew Jonson. Isolée's remix of Recloose's ""Cardiology"" does this insane thing where it makes it sound like a saxophone is dying, astral moans trailing off in background. Jay Haze's ""Appreciate"" is gospel house recorded through God's own phaser. And that's M.A.N.D.Y's big trick here. Body Language feels like microhouse, experimental house, whatever you want to call it. It certainly trades in all its clichés-- twitters and chits, streaks of overdone echo like someone rocking a guitar amp back and forth (try it...you can make your own Chain Reaction track!), fountains of time-stretching. But everything is rooted in a more traditionally body-friendly form of dance music, or at least has a steady, heavy rhythm holding it down.

The man who brought you the Pixies and, by extension, the alternative rock boom of the early 90s, took four days out of his busy schedule touring with his triumphantly reunited old band to record in Nashville with such legendary session men as Steve Cropper and Spooner Oldham. The result is Honeycomb, as album that has its inspired moments but ultimately comes off like something of a vanity project, with Black tackling a midpoint between classic country and classic r&b;, winding up with a sort of adult contemporary album full of lyrics about shrimp and selkies, those half-seal/half-human creatures of Orkney legend. To his credit, Black seems genuinely excited to be playing with his heroes, and he's invested in the material, as always, but the backing definitely has the ultra-competent feeling of a session rather than a band really gelling. Likewise, Black's written several great songs, but he may not actually be the best guy to sing them, as his voice has a tendency to die out on some of the more ambitious melodies. For instance, ""Strange Goodbye"" is a masterfully written duet that could have easily come from the Stax hit factory in the late-60s, but Black and his ex-wife Jean (they were still married at the time) here aren't a compelling pair-- ironic considering it's written about their impending break-up. The record's two peaks are actually covers of Dan Penn & Chips Moman's ""Dark End of the Street"" and key Black influence Doug Sahm's ""Sunday Sunny Mill Valley Groove Day"". The former finds Black doing a pretty good job with a tricky classic soul melody, while the latter is an exuberant, uptempo country-rock tune that the whole band seems to enjoy playing. The third cover, ""Song of the Shrimp"", is a bizarre ballad about a shrimp that leaves his parents for New Orleans, not realizing where the shrimp boat is taking him. Black, of course, turns in his own share of odd lyrics, peaking on ""Strange Goodbye"" and bottoming out these lines from the opening of ""Another Velvet Nightmare"": ""Today I felt my heart slide into my belly/ So I puked it up with liquor/ And I slept right where I lay."" Elsewhere, Cropper livens up ""My Life Is in Storage"" with richly phrased guitar solo and Black spikes his closing exhortation to ""Sing for Joy"" with tales of alcoholism and murder. The sum of it all is a bit less than what you might expect from the parts.

We Are Little Barrie,Little Barrie,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde613d197565213b64d/1:1/w_160/749ba3c9.jpg,2005-07-19 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4986-we-are-little-barrie/,Artemis,"If we're to believe the apparent tautology slapped atop their debut LP, Little Barrie are indeed Little Barrie. Whew. This much we also know: The Barrie in question is, presumably, frontman Barrie Cadogan, a stand-in ax-man on Morrissey's 2004 tour; he are Little Barrie. Bare-bones drummer Wayne Fulwood and nimble bassist Lewis Wharton round out the London trio; they are Little Barrie. Ultimately, Little Barrie could be a miniature jam band. Barrie's unimpeachable guitar virtuosity is their centerpiece, reason enough to name the assemblage in his honor. On record, at least, Little Barrie eschew jam bands' unexpurgated wankery, but they do embrace the corresponding hippie aesthetic. Smell the patchouli: ""Take a trip,"" Cadogan sings on breezy, hooky ""Free Salute""-- managing to sound like Jacks White (vox) and Johnson (six-string)-- but neither he nor the persistent groove are going anywhere, maaan. On ""Long Hair"", long-hairs are repeatedly advised to ""hide your face."" Punning ""Burned Out"", ""Greener Pastures"", and (whoa after ""Stones Reprise""!) ""Stones Throw"", further open the doors of Little Barrie's nostalgedelic perception. Hendrix is already inside, but so are Brown and Mayfield. In these parts, of course, jam bands are rarely discussed, unless they're undercover as avant gardists from New York (Sonic Youth) or Cologne (Can). Though perhaps too meat-headed to really whole-lotta love, Little Barrie are too energetically melodic to dismiss completely. The presence of ex-Orange Juice leader Edwyn Collins helps. He produced the album shortly before being hospitalized for a brain hemorrhage, and he captures the band's raw enthusiasm, scratching it with workmanlike feedback in all the right spots (like, right behind the ears). When the recycled smoke clears, Little Barrie could use more songwriting help from their patrons (Moz, Collins) and less hu-huh inspiration from Ocean Colour Scene's lobotomy-trad bong. ""These are the ghosts I've made,"" to quote former tourmates The Bees (aka A Band of Bees), who share the band's Lot's-wife-like leanings. Little Barrie have made, conjured up, or flat-out copied some of late-60s British rock's most venerated ghosts, and a few more from classic funk, all with mixed results. Perhaps the album's title isn't tautological, after all; Little Barrie know their name, but they don't yet seem to know who they are.","Trad rockers get production help from ex-Orange Juice leader Edwyn Collins.

Cochin Moon,Hosono & Yokoo,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c17ceb335119a49ed579/1:1/w_160/f1953f9e.gif,2005-07-19 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4016-cochin-moon/,KingKing,"Before performing with Ryuichi Sakamoto in classic Japanese synth pop outfit Yellow Magic Orchestra (or just YMO), producer and onetime session bassist Haruomi Hosono made his share of eclectic music. If you're familiar with YMO, you might imagine he was involved in Kraftwerk-influenced electronic music, or perhaps more traditional pop, but as it happens, he made his name as session bassist and playing in bands like the psychedelic Apryl Fool and folk rockers Happy End-- a far cry from the modernist slant of his reputation in the West. However, he also made a record in 1978 called Cochin Moon with keyboardist Shuka Nishihara, and future YMO bandmates Sakamoto and Hideki Matsutake that is arguably more bizarre and forward thinking than anything he's done since. Cochin Moon-- co-credited to Pop artist Tadanori Yokoo, who did the incredible Bollywood-style cover art-- is an electro-tropical soundtrack to a fake movie of the same name. That is, there was no film called Cochin Moon, but after visiting India, Hosono was inspired to make music suggesting the exotic, luxurious, and seemingly wonder-filled scenarios played out in Indian cinemas. However, the actual sound he and his cohorts came up with is often a world away from India: Imagine a totally electronic world of chattering bugs, fluttering birds, magic harps and drums that alternate between a thud and a blip. Hosono shares compositional duties with Nishihara, and Sakamoto's playing style is readily on display, as are Matsutake's considerable programming skills. As a historical document to YMO fans, Cochin Moon is interesting; as a slice of out-music stuck somewhere between Tangerine Dream, Wendy Carlos and Disney's Fantasia, it's almost classic. Hosono's ""Malabar Hotel"" trilogy-- comprised of a ""Ground Floor"", ""Upper Floor"" and ""Roof Garden""-- occupied the first side of the original LP, and eases me in like a snake. The brief ""Ground Floor...Triangle Circuit on the Sea-Forest"" begins with high-pitched insect-sirens, soft enough to mistake for crickets even when I know analog synths and primitive computers generate them. In the distance are waves breaking on a shore, and soon bass synth notes and alarms go off signaling the transition into the ""Upper Floor...Moving Triangle"". As a THX-esque sound test introduces fluttering percolations, an off-balanced, Indian-styled beat materializes. Half the beat is on the right, and half on the left; in between, where a snare should be, sits only the call of some robotic frog and a fly that just won't go away. This is tropical, and I can hear a pattern creep up from behind, and what sounds like men chanting. Filtered through an alien vocoder, it's difficult to decipher what they're saying, and as soon as I get close enough to make out the fuzzy, sonic outline of their words, they're interrupted by stuttering bass melody that eventually turns into a demi-cadenza, held afloat by ever more quickly percolating drum machine pulses. Bursts of angelic chord clusters accentuate the ends of melodic phrases, and from out of nowhere come electronic harp glissandi. Up and down, forward and backwards it runs, and soon the fizz of synthetic ocean mist drowns out the pulse, leaving only enough room for the pixie-bell harp, sudden eruptions of lava bubbles and that damn fly. ""Roof Garden...Revel Attack"" is born out of the fly's orbit, and introduces squeaky (near glitch) underwater computer blips. They start soft and spaced out, but soon gather momentum, all the while turning the fly buzz into a chorus of warped jet trail. A human voice speaking Japanese dips above the cacophony, and someone appears to be unwrapping a small package on the right. Then, just as suddenly, a synth line reminiscent of the melody from the ""Upper Floor"" reappears, with digitally harmonized voices supplying watercolor fanfares. The harp returns, in counterpoint with helicopter pulse on the right. The helicopter, apparently not satisfied in its supporting role, grows larger, overwhelming the competing melodies with sprawling whirl, and soon with more watery mist, like a rainstorm called on by a village shaman. And after a while, the storm passes, marked by the toll of a gong. And the fly is still there, buzzing in its lowest register before the gong closes the doors of the hotel and the piece fades into black. Nishihara's pieces are a bit less exotic, but no less interesting. ""Hepatitis"" is a shiny, bouncy piece of computer pop that might work well as a soundtrack to a Pixar sci-fi short about robotic fish. The bubbling sound effects are everywhere to be found, while cartoon-y melodies and state-of-1978 synth programming turn what might otherwise overwhelm itself with its own goofiness into something more bizarre. ""Hum Ghar Sajan"" (apparently, taken from a phrase by Indian guru Granth Sahib) is understated synth raga, as if informed equally by Kraftwerk and Ravi Shankar-- and accurately predicts Asa Chang & Junray's excursions into electro-exotica. A chanted vocal melody gives the song a mystical edge, and its recurring, high-pitched instrumental solo breaks sound straight out of Indian classical music. ""Madam Consul General of Madras"" is more tribal, sounding like ritualistic gamelan music meeting head on with the electronic tone poems of Wendy Carlos. Gradually, layers are painted on top, including a spazzed out synth line and more percolated synth patter sounding leftover from the Malabar's lobby, and the piece dissolves into dizzying keyboard clutter and the cricket sirens from the ""Ground Floor"". And I guess you can check out any time you like, but...well, you know the rest.","Reissue of a 1978 work by YMO's Haruomi Hosono, co-credited to Pop artist Tadanori Yokoo, who did the Bollywood-style cover art.

Less Than Human,The Juan MacLean,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb51ea9e61561daa71f1/1:1/w_160/5acde59d.jpg,2005-07-19 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4360-less-than-human/,AstralwerksDFA,"John Maclean has long been DFA's secret weapon. The Rapture gives good face. James Murphy gives good copy. Delia and Gavin give good ""oh, they're easily my favorite"" hipster trump card. But Maclean is the most effective. If any DFA records come close to hands-aloft status, it's his ""Give Me Every Little Thing"" and ""You Can't Have It Both Ways"". They're, you know, house music. No need for any prefixes or suffixes. Maclean's former band, Six Finger Satellite, were a bruising mixture of skinny tie and thick neck, mixed eye-meltingly loud by Murphy live, and all but blueprinting Les Savy Fav (who I like better, but why lie?) on record. Which might explain why his dance music is so muscular (have you listened to those early Rapture EP's lately?), but it does make Less Than Human, a good chunk of which could be described as ""gentle"" or at least ""pretty"", a bit surprising. It's not quite the masterpiece everyone (at least me) was hoping for (the exclusion of ""You Can't Have It Both Ways"", for example, should be punishable Midnight Express-style) but it does deliver on the hype, which in 2005 is almost the same thing. ""Shining Skinned Friend"" is filled to bursting over its bacon fat drums: theremin noise, vocodered sprites, ghostly coos, vocal synths, italo ripples, ""dark"" Euro vocals. This is his happening and it freaks me out. ""Give Me Every Little Thing"" is pure bliss, from the interstellar electrical storm opening to the whammy bar keytar solo that closes it out. In between, you've got a giant's handclaps, a groaning slap bass, barbiturate P-Funk chanting, and call-and-response synth squiggles. ""Tito's Way"" is one of the few nu-disco tracks that recognizes the power of the Party Whistle. (No ""whoop whoop"" though.) It also has breaking bells, steady-rocking drums, farty robot bass, and sassy-yet-dead-eyed femme vocals. The rest of the record is surprisingly melancholy. ""Love Is in the Air"" is Metro Area after a crying jag. ""In The Afternoon"" is background music for a breakup scene in a WB teen drama starring Ralf und Florian. ""My Time Is Running Out"" opens with Arcadian, cascading synth-strings and trills of bleeps like all-white Christmas lights blinking on and off. It could be the intro to a Kylie Minogue record before it rolls out another gently bumping, mid-tempo groove. (Actually, re-reading that, I'm not sure if it isn't a Kylie Minogue record.) Closer ""Dance With Me"" lopes for 12 minutes towards a climax that never comes, a busted robot shooting little sparks of piano as it limps towards Nancy Whang's siren song. The title track of Less Than Human (which appears nowhere on the album) was first released on the 2004 DFA Compilation #2. But come on: Even allowing for coincidence, is it possible to hear it without this year's Daft Punk album looming like an unanswered question? Alongside Vitalic-- Maclean's closest contemporary, especially when you factor in the penchant for queasy synth miniatures like opener ""AD2003""-- Maclean the student is now doing the ""robot rock"" thing better than the masters. And he only rocks about half the time. But then again Daft Punk once made their rep singing about unrequited love, rather than just breaking hearts. ","John Maclean has long been DFA's secret weapon.

New Waves,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84dc0084474cd0c0dcf/1:1/w_160/8811228c.jpg,2005-07-19 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2091-new-waves/,Family,"In recent years, I've come around to what is still rather secretly the most fertile time of musical evolution in the Pitchfork demographic's average lifetime, and given that I was between the ages of -2 and 4 when it was actually occurring, I don't feel too bad about being late to the party. The time period I'm talking about is 1977-1983, quite conveniently what is covered on this here double-disc compilation. To use the relevant genre classification instead of carbon-dating, it's the post-punk/new-wave era that New Waves cohesively digests, and while those two musical descriptors have become watered down over the years from overuse, this collection is a welcome reminder that they once were potent movements which laid the groundwork for much of the music we put in our ears today. Ay, there's the rub: One can't help but listen to a collection like this one without coming to a handful of shocking realizations about those flavors-of-the-moment I've done my part to hype-- turns out they're not making such an original statement after all. Which doesn't bother me so much-- derivativity is nothing to be ashamed of when done well-- except that I feel I've failed as a critic by not mentioning Jilted John's self-titled single as antecedent to Art Brut's everyday-occurrence anthems, or by only now realizing how much of Interpol's musical-mascara genetic material is derived from the Damned's ""Grimly Fiendish"". Oh well, never too late to start faking it. The reason why the sound of 77-83 is still so vital is probably due to the sound's intermixing of punk rebellion with dance-floor awareness, a mixture that still hasn't fully seeped into the deepest layers of indie rock, even given the recent hullaballoo. Of course, not everything on New Waves is an ancestor of poor, neglected dance-punk...there's a spectrum from standard punk snare-thwak (i.e. the Ramones, Buzzcocks) to disco-club infiltrators (i.e. Sparks, Robert Palmer) between which each of these 45 artists plant their sound. It's a worthy reminder, however, of how the reactionary, one-dimensional punk movement rose-lens celebrated by Warped Tour types lasted about nine months total, before the punks stopped thumbing their pierced noses at disco and started assimilating it. Then you can sit back and appreciate how the mixture was taken even farther by via the girl-group injections of Blondie (""Hanging on the Telephone""), the empty-room folk activism of Billy Bragg (""A New England""), Bow Wow Wow's herky-jerk rhythmicity (""Go Wild in the Country""), or Teardrop Explodes' hijacked soul-brass (""Reward""). Clicking off before post-punk segued into New Pop, New Waves offers up a few scraps of foreshadowing in ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and M's ""Pop Muzik"". There's very little to complain about with this set. It's very clear that the collection is unabashedly Britcentric, and the inclusion of pub-rock like Splodgenessabounds ""2 Pints of Lager & a Packet of Crisps Please"" might seem unnecessary, but after years of Ameri-canon indoctrination, it's refreshing to hear the story from a different vantage. I could maybe also haggle about the songs picked for certain artists; for instance, while it's always nice to be reminded that Dexy's Midnight Runners had more than one song, there's never a reason not to give people every possible chance to hear ""Come on Eileen"". But minor quibbles aside, New Waves is about as solid a primer for this era of musical history that can be acquired legally. Some of this territory was already covered by Rhino's No Thanks! box or the OOP 1-2-3-4: Punk and New Wave set, but this collection, packed as it is into two discs and with a strict one-song-per-artist rule, offers a much more concise argument for the time period's relevancy. So while a couple listens through New Waves may make you feel a bit like an idiot for having loudly trumpeted the fresh sound of Franz Ferdinand to your friends last year, it's not too late to dig the sound of the first time around.","Family's comp collects some of the best pop/rock from 1977-83, encapsulating the post-punk era and drawing a line between punk and disco.

Layourbattleaxedown,The Concretes,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6409d034d5c69bf34be/1:1/w_160/1e908eef.jpg,2005-07-18 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1572-layourbattleaxedown/,Astralwerks,"On their excellent self-titled 2004 album, the Concretes cloaked the girl-group pop of Phil Spector and Motown in the narcotic haze of the Velvet Underground and the Jesus and Mary Chain, weaving traces of country alongside their warbling horns, ecstatic strings, and droning distortion. Now here's Layourbattleaxedown, a surprisingly consistent B-sides and rarities disc. Opener ""Forces"" tips listeners off that this set, like earlier EP collection Boyoubetterrunnow or side project Heikki, leans more toward spare, country-tinged songwriting than their breakthrough's candy-store pop, lush sleigh ride ""Lady December"" proving the primary exception. Even if you're not as big on the band's more countrified efforts, don't miss their version of ""Miss You"". Like many of the Rolling Stones' hits, this one always seemed like basically just a riff, albeit a killer one-- plus ""disco sucks"" man, amiright? But the Concretes' version concentrates on the lyrics' stiff-lipped heartbreak, replacing Jagger's preening yowl with Victoria Bergsman's slight, dispassionate vocals, hauntingly multi-tracked for the wordless hook. ""Oh, baby,"" one wonders, ""why you wait so long?"" After all, saxophones are dying, electric guitars crumbling like a decrepit imperial capitol. The pace and mood rarely alter throughout this collection, but the mournful ""Oh Baby"", complacent ""Free Ride"", and string-drenched ""The Warrior"" all would have been strong enough for The Concretes. Arboreal lullabies ""Branches"" and ""Under Your Leaves"" err toward preciousness, but they're (stop me now) growers. ""Seems Fine"", from the full-length, captures the idée fixe of the Concretes-- or most great pop songs, for that matter-- in that it's all about appearances, or rather, all about the disjunction between crystalline, perfect exteriors and uncontrollable emotion. ""Seems Fine Shuffle"" gives the original a bluegrass makeover, and it turns out to be an improvement. Here, as throughout, Layourbattleaxedown strips bare the moody, terse melancholy that gives even the Concretes' peppier material its emotional resonance.","On their excellent self-titled 2004 album, the Concretes cloaked the girl-group pop of Phil Spector and\n\ Motown in the ...

The Selfish Mirror,Vanishing Kids,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9a313d19756521398c9/1:1/w_160/70b695a5.gif,2005-07-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8539-the-selfish-mirror/,Underground Inc.,"Remind me again-- does bigger mean better or do good things come in small packages? Maybe it doesn't matter, since Portland-via-Madison, Wisc., quartet the Vanishing Kids paradoxically encapsulate both clichés. Of course, with industrial journeyman Martin Atkins (whose résumé includes stints with PiL, Killing Joke, and Nine Inch Nails, as well as producing a laughable industrial Christmas album) turning the knobs, the band's goal is clear-- sculpt a murky leviathan of a post-punk album on par with PiL's Metal Box or the Cure's Pornography. Strangely though, The Selfish Mirror suggests bigness using a small medium, tantamount to Moby Dick performed on a miniature ship inside a glass bottle. Yes, this album flaunts cavernous reverb, booming drum fills, and stratospheric synth splashes, but so does the soundtrack to The Lion King, and certainly no one's throwing ""Hakuna Matata"" onto mixes alongside Loveless tracks. But hey, in a perfect world size doesn't matter, just who you sound like, and the Vanishing Kids definitely choose the right touchstones. Aside from Atkins' occasional nostalgic bursts (does ""Shadow of a Doubt"" really have to sound as crunchy as Killing Joke's ""Requiem""?), the band maps out an eclectic, albeit threadbare, agenda of 80s new wave, shoegazer, and noise rock. Fortunately, a revolving door policy on vocals and equally skittish song stylings keep this otherwise stale fish relatively fresh. The album's first third finds the band fitting securely in their profound britches. Despite its forceful Geddy Lee/Perry Farrell hybrid vocals, ""Tell Me"" swiftly glides on gloomy basslines and obsequious pleading to, ahem, ""tell me."" Massive opener ""Shadow of a Doubt"" avoids crumpling under its own weight, instead swelling consistently throughout its six-and-a-half minute duration. Unfortunately, the song's slow, ethereal grind and frontman Jason Hartman's breathy vocals only tease as the majority of the album fails to manage the unwieldy aesthetic. The cerebral title track overestimates its faux-My Bloody Valentine allure, and after eight-minute epic ""Snow Angel"" sputters on only 60 seconds worth of ideas, it's clear the Vanishing Kids feel more comfortable with immediate, hooks-driven sprints than languishing drone-rock marathons. ""Sleeping Beats"" and the first half of closer ""Talk"" may seem to nonchalantly toss out bits of dance-punk and electro-pop compared to more deliberate, protracted numbers, but these songs chug along without hitting any musical potholes from start to finish. Fortunately, The Selfish Mirror's shortcomings arise not from poor taste or lack of skill but from unfamiliarity with their own limitations; paying homage to your pet bands is great, but in the end these guys should write what they want to write, not what they want to want to write.","Indie rock band maps out a course of 80s new wave, shoegazer, and noise rock.

Your Favorite People All in One Place,Medications,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c570eb335119a49ed9e3/1:1/w_160/22681953.jpg,2005-07-18 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5611-your-favorite-people-all-in-one-place/,Dischord,"The theory, at least in the rock world, is that the debut EP is supposed to tease the listener with a couple of great songs and one or two others that hint at potential, whetting the appetite for the album that follows and delivers on that potential. You could not have a more perfect case study of that principle in action than D.C.'s Medications, whose five song, self-titled opening salvo last year was an accomplished, tantalizing mission statement for a band keen on establishing an identity for themselves separate from Faraquet, the band that essentially became Medications after a personnel switch. Your Favorite People All in One Place takes that EP and builds on it in two directions: one more lush and melodically intense; the other drier, more serially rhythmic, and somewhat closer to the old-fashioned guitar tangle of Faraquet and 90s Dischord post-hardcore. Excellent opener ""Surprise!"" goes in the former direction, creeping out from a protracted intro with choppy drums, roiling guitars, and melodic vocals that hover pensively in the verses. The song builds to multiple shuddering climaxes, Devin Ocampo's guitar stabbing out with ragged riffs and snowballing lead lines. It's a stunner, and it sort of makes you wish they had spent the whole record exploring this sound. As it happens, much of the rest of the album opts more for typically D.C.-sounding rhythmic jaggedness, which to be fair the band does quite well. The trio engage in precise, tightly wound interplay as a matter of course, peaking on ""Opinions"", which veers into frenetic passages of wild, jittering guitar, stuttering bass, and calamitous drumming. Drummer Andrew Becker has some banner moments on the record, especially his razor-sharp fills on ""This Is the Part We Laugh About"", which adds a whole dimension to the song that it wouldn't work well without. On that note, Medications are sort of a modern power trio, each member's instrumental parts playing an integral role in the band's make-up. Using that approach, they've turned in a solid debut album that nicely balances their pop tendencies with their more destructive urges. If there's any one thing holding this record back from greatness, it's the occasional passage that's too start-stop for its own good, but those are few and far between, and Your Favorite PeopleÉ should please the Dischord contingent.","Dischord band follows a promising, self-titled EP with its debut full-length.

Further From Grace,Nick Castro and the Poison Tree,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a740b1335d7bf1698ff2/1:1/w_160/32b2eba6.jpg,2005-07-18 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1813-further-from-grace/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"On Further From Grace, the second album from Nick Castro, the hirsute L.A.-based troubadour has wisely taken full advantage of the extensive network of inspired folk eccentrics currently mushrooming across the countryside. Featuring appearances from Josephine Foster and Espers' Meg Baird, in addition to the uniformly stellar work of his crack(ed) band the Poison Tree, Further From Grace positively shimmers with willowy, sun-dappled ensemble playing, and firmly establishes Castro as yet another noteworthy voice of the present acid folk resurgence. As is the case with Philadelphia's Espers, Castro's music hearkens less to old-timey American forms of Appalachian folk or country blues than it does to the golden age of 60s-70s UK folk-rock, as practiced by groups like the Incredible String Band or Mellow Candle. Inching softly away from some of the more blatant Donovan/ Syd Barrett solo emanations of his 2004 self-released debut A Spy in the House of God, here Castro and company employ an ambitious menu of exotic acoustic instruments to forge a verdant, medieval-tinged sound, one which draws on any number of pan-global folk traditions. And though there are times when the album threatens to capsize beneath its own preciousness (such as on the delightful, flute-centric ""To This Earth"", which incautiously risks floating away like a puff of new-agey Celtic Myst) the strength of Castro's melodic compositions and the group's deft musicianship should manage to enchant any but the most Hobbit-phobic listeners. With his clear, refreshingly unmannered vocals on straightforward tunes like ""Won't You Sing to Me,"" Castro strikes a figure recalling Tom Rapp of Pearls Before Swine or a young, more starry-eyed David Gilmour. In Castro's lyrics, cheeks tend to be white as snow and eyes are apt to shine like diamonds, which is perhaps another reason why most of the memorable passages on Further From Grace are instrumental in nature. The opening ""Sun Song"" combines Baird's lap dulcimer with Otto Hauser's nimble hand percussion and Foster's mesmeric, wordless vocalizing to create a full-scale gypsy swoon, one that could easily continue on weightlessly for miles before you realize your gas tank is empty and your watch has lost its hands. Even further transporting is the brief ""Music for Mijwiz"", a whirling Middle Eastern dervish on which Castro plays the titular Arabic, double-reeded woodwind over a sandstorm rhythm, or the epic ""Deep, Deep Sea"", a captivating piece whose lengthy intro is adorned with Adam Hershberger's lyrical, surprisingly jazzy flugelhorn, before Castro eventually leads the whole company back into more familiar Soft Machine-like canyons and valleys. As the album closes with the aptly-named acoustic soar of ""Walk Like a Whisper"", the seasoned folk-rock traveler will undoubtedly recognize many a feature of this tranquil landscape, but will also likely be helpless to resist the urge to continually retrace Castro's every step, reluctant to miss out on a single contour of this varied and beguiling album.","Hirsute L.A.-based troubadour and his band, the Poison Tree, get help from Josephine Foster and Espers' Meg Baird on their second LP.

La Forêt,Xiu Xiu,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aad013d1975652139ad6/1:1/w_160/ae4b1319.jpg,2005-07-14 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8827-la-foret/,5RC,"Burdened by a strong personality and a difficult homelife, Jonathan Caouette turned to obsessive self-documentation as a way to distance himself from his problems. From age 11 onward, Caouette locked the camera's lens on himself and his inconceivably dysfunctional family, capturing every tragedy in their spectacular meltdown. Those years of navel-gazing eventually culminated in his meta-documentary Tarnation, a riveting record of one young man's attempts not just to survive, but to flourish under impossible circumstances. The music of Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart occupies an aesthetically similar space. Artists who intimately embrace their own struggles are commonly chided for being solipsistic, but Stewart, like Caouette, engages in a self-scrutiny so ruthless and unflinching that it surpasses mere melodrama and becomes magnetic, grotesque, even beautiful. Their work seems less a vehicle for vanity or narcissism than an instrument of basic survival. Xiu Xiu's last album, Fabulous Muscles, found Stewart reaching the apex of his accomplishments to date. All the hallmarks of the earlier records-- the juxtaposition of cloying sentimentality with base brutality, sculpted cadences with nebulous noise, and husky whispers with tortured screams-- were wrangled into precise pop clockwork. Pitch-perfect blends of emotional exigency and musical accessibility like ""I Luv the Valley OH!"" broadened Xiu Xiu's audience beyond those willing to grit their teeth and wade through a morass of confrontational clangor. La For\xEAt, however, backs off dramatically from the pop side of Fabulous Muscles to expand upon its quiet, murky dimension. Here, Stewart's vocals hang in hazy suspensions of wafting guitars, piercing chimes, subliminal drones, and ornately wrought percussion. ""Clover"" forgoes noisy protrusions in favor of tiptoeing guitar, xylophone, and small, sweeping whirs; ""Mousey Toy"" is a dirge of ghostly piano, rattling percussion, and a noisy midsection of atonal flourishes, martial rim shots, and gong-like crashes. There are upbeat holdovers: ""Muppet Face"", after opening with cascading glockenspiel, blossoms into a lean, multilayered synth groove, a mechanism with many tiny moving parts interlocking complexly, while the excellent ""Bog People"" is a runaway engine of crisp guitars and synths, drum claps and ratcheting percussive undercarriage. Xiu Xiu's resonance with Joy Division's knotted, barren dread has been noted often, but the similarity to Conor Oberst is usually ignored. It's especially apparent on ""Bog People"": ""There will always be a headless neck/ There will always be happiness,"" Stewart sings, tweaking the last syllable of happiness, and going on to push fervently against his vocal range in a way that will sound instantly familiar to Bright Eyes fans. ""Pox"", another clear standout, is a suicide glide through skittering drums, slithering guitars, and an urgent electronic pulse. One of Xiu Xiu's greatest assets is singularity: You'd never mistake one of their songs for another band's. While some music carries on a heritage, Stewart's seems like a purely generative, spontaneous expression of a unique sensibility, and what's especially remarkable is how a record that seems so brash on the surface reveals its subtlety by increments. Over repeated listens, a dialogue emerges within Stewart's lyrical blend of the sweet and profane. La For\xEAt is a record that mutters to itself in the dark: ""I tried hard to be good to you,"" Stewart sings on ""Clover"", ""I felt peace inside my head."" And after what seems like an eternity on this content-loaded record-- we didn't even touch on one of the best songs, the beautifully deformed smooth-jazz of ""Ale"", with its measured, plosive foghorn tones and razor-sharp lyrical turns-- that call is answered on the ominously amorphous ""Rose of Sharon (Grey Ghost)"": ""You tried so hard to be as sweet as you can for me/ But I don't see you for who you are.""","Burdened by a strong personality and a difficult homelife, Jonathan Caouette turned to obsessive self-documentation as a way to distance ...

The fact that there's a Motherfucker (as in Jackie-O) along for the ride doesn't change the overriding MO of the primary players. Aurora is gorgeous, cinematic stuff, dominated by cello and eccentric percussive instruments like clevises and rototom shells. And, unsurprisingly, the packaging is equally gorgeous-- an embossed gatefold CD sleeve complete with black disc envelope and postcard, as well as slightly skewed typeface setting. Folks not yet inured to this collective's bombast and grandeur might be surprised by how gentle and serene these tracks are. ""Histories Repeating..."" lists in a foggy meditative fashion for nearly 17 minutes, while the comparatively pop-length ""Why She Swallows..."" twinkles and trembles. When there's a threat of the folks rocking out in a hamfisted fashion (as on the very first track, ""Quelques Mots Pleins D'ombre""), Esmerine opts to err on the demure side of aggression. Folks unfamiliar with all things godsped, but with a predilection for groups like Rachels and the Dirty Three, might also want to give this a try. For those that got over the gorgeous instrumentation and the importance of each telegraphed loud-soft shift and the interminable song titles sometime after Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada, this disc will seem relentlessly polite and tasteful. More importantly, Aurora won't sound much different than anything this group-- together or apart-- has already produced. That's not necessarily a bad thing.

Okemah and the Melody of Riot,Son Volt,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b19d034d5c69bf311e/1:1/w_160/8ac0d25e.jpg,2005-07-14 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7331-okemah-and-the-melody-of-riot/,LegacyTransmit Sound,"Okemah is a small town in eastern-central Oklahoma that's famous as the birthplace of Woody Guthrie, who serves as the guiding spirit of Son Volt's comeback album. On the leadoff track, ""Bandages and Scars"", Jay Farrar (the only one remaining from the band's original 90s line-up) reveals the impetus for Okemah and the Melody of Riot: ""the words of Woody Guthrie ringing in my head"" got him thinking about the current political climate, which ostensibly inspired these songs. It's as if, denied the opportunity to record Guthrie's lyrics, Farrar has made his own Mermaid Avenue, one that bypasses the original's time-capsule quality for an explicitly contemporary relevance. Or maybe it's the times that have made Guthrie more significant now than he was seven years ago. He's not the only musician Farrar turns to for guidance on Okemah, which is perhaps his most politically and socially charged album since March 16-20, 1992. He alludes to Bob Dylan on ""Afterglow 61"" (named after the highway) and both Gil Scott-Heron and John Fogerty on ""Jet Pilot"", which revisits Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Fortunate Son"" but with a much more specific target (just guess). But Farrar doesn't seem to be trying to re-fashion himself as a modern-day Guthrie on these songs; as always, he's much too reverential toward his influences to think he might occupy their ranks. Instead, he's reviving them for a tumultuous era that he thinks needs them desperately. ""There's no reason to be downhearted/there's music in the wheels there to be found,"" he sings on ""Afterglow 61"", elaborating on the genre he helped define. Okemah proves to be not just 13 protest songs, but 13 songs about protest songs. Farrar believes unquestioningly in music's ability to affect tremendous social change, soothe a nation, or stop an ""endless war with no moral face."" That idea still sounds as attractive and optimistic now as it was 70 years ago when Guthrie sang about the Dust Bowl, and although he doesn't seem to consider that perhaps reverent hindsight grants protest music most of its power, Farrar wants to resurrect that musical populism as a weapon against the current administration. Appropriately, Okemah is grassroots in both politics and sound. Despite its new line-up, Son Volt churns out the same sturdy riff-heavy rock of Trace and Wide Swing Tremolo, but the band sounds more invigorated on songs like ""6 String Belief"" and even on slower tracks like ""Medication"". Farrar's and Brad Rice's sandpaper guitars evoke the mythic Americana of 70s Southern rock, especially against the chugging rhythm section of drummer Dave Bryson and one-time Meat Puppet Andrew Duplantis on bass. Despite the heightened band dynamics, Farrar remains the central figure on these songs, and his distinct approach complicates and occasionally compromises Okemah. The melodies are less lethargic than those on Straightaways and the lyrics more intelligible than those on Wide Swing Tremolo; if they're devoid of Guthrie's humor, at least ""Jet Pilot"" manages some disgusted sarcasm toward (you guessed it) Bush. And ""Who"" manages a devious ambiguity: ""Who makes the minutes move/ The post-meridian news/ Who, who else but you?"" ""You"" could be either the populace or Fox News; the song either a populist anthem or a middle finger. As the album progresses, though, Farrar's lyrics become increasingly stilted and veiled, reverting to the forced wordplay and disconnected evocations of his most obscure songs. In the past, this tendency toward purple opacity could be excused, but on Okemah it hinders Farrar considerably, clouding the issues rather than arguing or elevating them. ""Ipecac"" takes on big corporations and class differences-- important topics after the Enron fallout-- but, head-scratchingly, he warns us to ""watch out for love like ipecac"", perhaps more drawn to the word's cutting consonants than to its connotations. Okemah is in the end too cerebral, lacking the gutpunch impact of the best protest music. With ""rock and roll 'round my head like a 6-string belief,"" Farrar's been thinking so much about Woody Guthrie that these songs never leave his own head.","Latest record from alt-country hero Jay Farrar is named in part for Woody Guthrie's birthplace.

The Message / They Said it Couldn't Be Done,Grandmaster FlashGrandmaster Flash & The Furious Five,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c01ec0084474cd0c313c/1:1/w_160/01fff7e8.jpg,2005-07-14 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11751-the-message-they-said-it-couldnt-be-done/,Sugar Hill,"Almost every music genre has a batch of fans that consider the earliest formative material to be the never-bettered ""pure"" expression of the style. In jazz you have Louis Armstrong and the Hot Five records. In blues take your pick of pre-WWII blues artists like Son House or Charley Patton. In rock'n'roll you have Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. In punk you have the Ramones. Even if you don't particularly rate such seminal artists, you still have to admire their mastery of their respective idioms and the way each came to define a form. Hip-hop doesn't seem to work the same way; few if any fans believe it peaked with the sides released by Enjoy and Sugarhill at the dawn of the 80s, as much as they might dig selected singles. Maybe hip-hop was such a new and radical expression it took its community a few years to understand what it was about and how best its innovations could be applied. It being the late 70s, a time when recording was widespread and after a few novelty records had become hits, the awkward early stages were fully documented, to resurface later on endless streams of ""Old School"" comps and, occasionally, reissues of complete albums. Here are two such artifacts, the first two long-players by Grandmaster Flash's group. Everyone knows now how influential Grandmaster Flash was to the mechanics of DJing, with his invention and popularization of various mixing and scratching techniques. And speaking of the ""early stuff is best"" phenomenon mentioned above, his 7-minute piece ""The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel"" (not included on these records) is arguably the finest DJ collage in hip-hop history. The group released a handful of other stellar early singles-- ""Superrappin'"", ""Freedom"", ""Birthday Party"". As an ""album artist,"" though, well... The Message has two absolutely essential songs, both of which have been widely anthologized. The title track has rightly been hailed as hip-hop's first overtly political expression, with sharply observed scenes of New York at its broken-down worst voiced by lead Furious Five rapper Grandmaster Melle Mel. Less discussed is the fantastically likable musical backing, with the squelchy synth riff that's now completely burned into the collective pop music consciousness, and it's stiff'n'funky drum machine beat. But even the sonic treat of ""The Message"" pales next to the polished chrome man-machine of ""Scorpio"", for my money the greatest early electro track and the best vocodered robot-rap of all time. The next tier of The Message contains single ""It's Nasty"" and the upbeat party jam ""She's Fresh"". The former appropriates the music from Tom Tom Club's ""Genius of Love"" the way Sugerhill Gang appropriated Chic, and no matter what you're doing out front, it's hard to go wrong with that particular synth riff and beat. Down further is ""It's a Shame"", a forgettable but inoffensive mid-tempo rap, and then the record bottoms out with ""Dreamin"" (a tribute to Stevie Wonder-- sample lyrics: ""Stevie, you make me wonder. I dream about you, Stevie"") and ""You Are"", abysmal ballads that sound like they were pulled from a ""Mr. Show"" parody. Shortly after The Message was released Melle Mel became Grandmaster Melle Mel and took two of the Furious Five with him to form his own group. Melle Mel recorded ""White Lines (Don't Do It),"" the final classic track associated with this crew. Flash soldiered on, assembling a new group and recorded They Said it Couldn't Be Done. Oddly, it's more consistent than the debut, with no flat-out bad tracks, but also no real high points. The use of synthesizers is more sophisticated (which isn't always a good thing), and some of the quick-cut proto sampling has historical interest. When the chorus hooks are on, as with ""Girls Like the Way She Spins"", it's not bad. It was 1985, though, and by then Run D.M.C. was on the scene; relatively speaking Grandmaster Flash sounds way behind. Sensing this, Flash steals a title and a sound with ""Rock the House"", which has guitars and a mid-tempo rock backbeat though none of the energy of the guys from Hollis. Flash would release a couple more records in the 80s without much success, and then he dropped off the radar, resurfacing periodically to play shows when given a boost by current DJs who understand his importance to hip-hop's development. In his world, though, ""importance"" doesn't necessarily pay.","Reissues of the first two LPs from the hip-hop pioneers.

China Is Near,Jim O’RourkeWhite OutWilliam Winant,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaadc0084474cd0c1224/1:1/w_160/f2241513.gif,2005-07-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8795-china-is-near/,ATP,"Since their late-1990s inception, White Out-- as comprised by multi-instrumentalist Lin Culbertson and drummer Tom Surgal-- have been one of the most consistently absorbing and unpredictable experimental outfits on the grid. The duo's fertile sound is unusually malleable, due in part to a top-notch succession of collaborators ranging from the No Neck Blues Band's David Nuss to Nels Cline to Thurston Moore. For their third album, China Is Near, White Out have enlisted perhaps their most sympathetic ringers yet-- percussionist William Winant and avant-chameleon Jim O'Rourke. And with the aid of these familiar, well-traveled guests-- each of whom has appeared on more records than most of us could consume in a decade-- White Out are here again able to boldly pilot their freeform clamor toward distant alien horizons. China Is Near marks White Out's second studio go-around with their frequent live partner O'Rourke, following their Ecstatic Peace alliance on 2000's Drunken Little Mass. Thanks in large measure to Culbertson's extensive use of burbling analog synths, that album showcased the collective at their most overtly jazzy, their cosmic agitations frequently recalling early-70s era Herbie Hancock or Sun Ra at his Moogiest. And while China Is Near retains a few hazy echoes of that predecessor, here the group has further atomized their nebulous sound, continually spiraling the music's various fragments further and further outward from previously mapped territories and definable genres. With the presence of Winant, the album unsurprisingly finds White Out's work increasingly dominated by its astonishing variety of percussive textures. Neither Winant nor Surgal is the type of percussionist who settles easily for the mundane duties of timekeeping. Here instead the two augment their wide assortment of drums with an eclectic array of chains, scrap metal and gongs as they stretch their loose, intuitive playing to inhabit whatever open space Culbertson and O'Rourke can spare. This approach results in intensely evocative tracks like ""Empty Centre"", a gauzy drone that Winant and Surgal encompass with jingle bells and the rattle of knives to ward off all evil spirits and/or grizzly bears. Similarly, on ""Mutinous"" a mounting force of tympanis pound like the sinister footsteps of an encroaching invasion force as swarms of growling electronics slowly build to do feverish battle, the listener forcibly encouraged to quickly choose sides. Since they use such an unorthodox array of electronic and treated instrumentation-- such as the distorted, unearthly autoharp that rakes across the face of ""Stipledmoon""-- it's often difficult to pinpoint exactly which musician is generating each specific noise. O'Rourke, as always, blends effortlessly into his surroundings, and though this masterful versatility makes him a valuable addition to virtually any ensemble, it can also render his individual voice rather invisible. (If he's contributed any guitar here, I must admit I don't immediately recognize it.) Consequently there's nothing on China Is Near-- besides its general air of restless, questing curiosity-- that stands out as distinctively ""O'Rourkian,"" but that certainly does little to detract from this album's molten, form-shifting splendor.","The absorbing and unpredictable experimental outfit is here joined by Jim O'Rourke and William Winant.

Triple P,Platinum Pied Pipers,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19eb1335d7bf16982e0/1:1/w_160/38ece0ea.jpg,2005-07-13 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6579-triple-p/,Ubiquity,"The production team-cum-recording artists in Detroit's Platinum Pied Pipers face commercial disadvantages. Record buyers often prefer the face on the cover to the voice behind the mic, and who can blame 'em. Shit gets confusing, like when the Neptunes became N.E.R.D. and they were a band but they weren't a band and...? Waajeed's Slum Village roots may help, but, frankly, Triple P probably won't make good on the Pipers' metal-promising moniker. Presents...-style collections do have a leg up on their emcee-sponsored counterparts: stylistic coherence. (Hey, I care.) Triple P is no different. Each track is piloted by a gigantic, rushing thump. Sounds unremarkable, but continuity of beat is the first commandment of hip-hop production, and the hood is overrun by damn sinners. On top of this generous featherbed, PPP dump heaps of gooey, lounged-out instrumentation. One track has, like, eight electric pianos. Three more have seven. But ""Your Day Is Done"", which only brings five, is the no-brainer standout. The beat, to which Georgia lends serviceable belting and rapping, is definitive Detroit rushed snare, both smooth and skittish. Yet for all the pleasant pastichery, many tracks get a strike for mediocre, half-assed, or annoying vocal performances. PPP are immodestly generous, doling out feature spots like it's their duty to God. When those spots are occupied by established talent, like Jay Dee, the results can be exhilarating. But most of the album's guests are yet-to-blow newbies, most of whom sound timorous. One passerby who could use more trepidation is Lacks, whose performance on ""The Pees"" is downright obnoxious. He flows like a slap bassist, performing exhausting rudiments in too-tight spaces with little grace and even less rhythm. Not sayin' it couldn't work, but the sassy Mr. Lacks does not jive with the Pipers' low-laying desert bar confections. To PPP's credit, weak contributions from Sa-Ra Creative Partners, Tiombre Lockhart, and Zeno are redeemed by stellar beats. Dappled with streaks of astral synths, ""Deep Inside"" has a shy, backgrounded feel, which complements Sa-Ra's quiet, private-groovin' vox. ""I Got You"" sounds like a civil union of Nicolay's Foreign Exchange project and Rich Harrison's fabulous ""1 Thing"" go-go beat: It throbs elegant brass and ivory under lo-fi saran, while a cacophonous ride bell tap dances in the back-background. MC Invincible's appearance on ""Detroit Winter"" sums up the record's shortcomings: Her skills are undeniable, but girl needs to speak up. So, while I'm frustrated that Triple P takes few risks and that its guest performers are so coweringly modest about their talents, Platinum Pied Pipers still get a pat on the back. And a motivational pep talk. And a goblet-full of sizzurp, because what the hell.","The production team-cum-recording artists in Detroit's Platinum Pied Pipers face commercial disadvantages.

Reads the Books EP,Prefuse 73,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a119ea9e61561daa46fd/1:1/w_160/b8ebae92.jpg,2005-07-13 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6453-reads-the-books-ep/,Warp,"There's something inherently fascinating to me about album-length remixes. The long-form remix finds one artist immersing himself completely in the work of another, struggling to find a way to inject his own ideas in an attempt to make something new, and it's fascinating to imagine someone-- whether it's Mad Professor sitting down with Massive Attack's Protection or Bill Laswell in a vault with five years worth of electric Miles Davis jams-- surveying reels of tape and dreaming of how it might all come together. On Surrounded By Silence, Prefuse 73 included a song called ""Pagina Dos"", on which he further chopped the banjo and sampled voices of the Books, added beats, and layered ethereal wordless vox on top. It was one of the best tracks on the record, and now Herren follows by issuing this 22-minute EP-- eight tracks built on a foundation of Books material. Prefuse and the Books are a good match. Herren's distinctive drum programming is mid-tempo and open, allowing plenty of room for the Books' busier samples and strings to do their thing. The emotional approaches overlap as well, as the Prefuse vibe has always contained a pastoral tint, with Herren's interest in South American and Western European folk and pop seeping into the head-nodding hip-hop. The thoughtful and studied tone of Prefuse fits snugly with Books' cleverness and whimsy. Prefuse 73 Reads the Books is most interesting when Herren plays a shell game with the source material, letting a familiar fragment of a Books song poke out only to trim it back again with a series of sharp edits. Two key bits are pulled from the title track to The Lemon of Pink. ""Pagina Seis"" lets the unforgettable banjo/cello/voice sigh that opens the Books' second record in for a few seconds and then pulls it away; the ensuing drum groove is warm and comforting, relaxed beats veined with loops of guitar and banjo that are obviously Books but from no song in particular. The slow, lazy plucking that accompanies Ann Doerner on the same Books original finds its way into both ""Pagina Dos"" and ""Pagina Ocho"". On the latter, Herren smashes the notes into small ringing clusters and uses the banjo as a contrast to an original ethereal vocal from Claudia Deheza. Nothing mind-blowing here, just an efficient EP filled with enjoyable music. Since The Books project is built on notions of appropriation and recontextualization it's obviously malleable, and Herren's breezy trip through the material feels like just another natural layer that could lend itself to further tinkering. I doubt we've heard the last of this collaboration.","There's something inherently fascinating to me about album-length remixes.

De Nova,The Redwalls,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3139d034d5c69bf2d33/1:1/w_160/aa50f6a2.jpg,2005-07-13 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6935-de-nova/,Capitol,"The Redwalls really, really want to remind you of a certain Four. They've joined Louis XIV and The Bravery in 2005's fake-British-accent sweepstakes. Their lyrics are heavy on early-60s beat-fillers like ""well"", ""oh"", ""hey"", and ""alright"" [sic]. With so much twisting and shouting, the Redwalls sometimes come across like a bunch of teenagers from Chicago's North Shore taking a fateful day off. And with good reason: They started in 2001 as a British-rock cover band from a high school in Deerfield, Ill. On their second full-length (and major-label debut), they're more polished and they've stopped paying royalties, but not much else has changed. Despite singer Logan Baren's intermittent Lennon impressions, Beatles comparisons give the Redwalls far too much credit. They more frequently appropriate from (and pale beside) their fellow appropriators. Opener ""Robinson Crusoe"" rides a riff borrowed from 1971 smash ""Bang a Gong (Get It On)"" by infinitely superior fakebook-readers T. Rex, complete with horns-- a new addition on this sophomore effort. ""Back Together"" treads through sub-Oasis-isms-- ""There's nothing you can say that isn't what you said""-- over a monotone guitar lick not far removed from the Guess Who's ""American Woman"". Even piano-based ""Build a Bridge"" is little more than a forgettable cover of Joe Cocker's Beatles-covering ""The Wonder Years"" theme. The real groans come when the Redwalls get serious. ""What's this shit goin' down 'bout the FCC?"" asks Baren in full ""Gimme Some Truth""-Lennon mode on ""Falling Down"", before launching into a perfunctory chorus (""Darling, I've been falling down""). It's a good thing the Redwalls are defying the censors, or else society might go bereft of such controversial statements as ""Love is all around/ And it's for everyone"" from ballad ""How the Story Goes"", which sees Baren trying on Rod Stewart huskiness. Then there's ""Front Page"", which opens with newscast snippets about violence in Israel. This song desperately wishes it could be ""A Day in the Life"", but ""the world keeps turning around and around, yeah, around"", and turns out it's only ""Angel of Harlem""-grade Bono bluster. For finale ""Glory of War"", Baren dons the nasality of Bob Dylan or Barry McGuire and pens a generality-laden Vietnam War protest a few years too late. Somewhere, Karl Rove is smirking. Influences are fine, gang. What makes De Nova so forgettable is not its traditionalism, but rather its clichés of thought and emotion, which betray a lack of creativity that extends beyond recycled melodies (though, yep, that's ""Green River"" in the verse of the inevitable ""It's Alright""). This is the type of band that would swipe the name of Brian Jacques' imaginative young-adult book series because a previous moniker, the Pages, was already claimed by pre-fame Mr. Mister. Sure, you can make some fine copies of copies these days, even decent copies of copies of copies, CTRL-C and CTRL-C and CTRL-C on down to hackneyed infinity. There's also shift-delete.","Latest LP from the Chicago-based 60s pop fetishists.

Songs of Muerto County,Puerto Muerto,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19fc0084474cd0bfe53/1:1/w_160/0aa0c75f.jpg,2005-07-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6580-songs-of-muerto-county/,Fire,"The sticker on the jewel case of my copy of Puerto Muerto's Songs of Muerto County proudly proclaims the album ""a 'lost' soundtrack to the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE."" It's an audacious claim, as the album is not ""lost"" and postdates the movie by more than thirty years. Instead, it's actually an homage to the scariest and most brutal 70s horror film, which was set in the fictional Muerto County, home of the most terrifying family in Texas (okay, the second most terrifying). No strangers to carnage (previous albums include See You in Hell and Your Bloated Corpse Has Washed Ashore), the Chicago-based duo of Tim Kelley and Christa Meyer were inspired by Tobe Hooper and Wayne Bell's atmospheric and often atonal noise soundtrack and the generic country tunes that eerily emanate from every radio frequency within county lines. Unlike that ""lost"" Wizard of Oz soundtrack called Dark Side of the Moon, Songs of Muerto County is not meant to match up song for scene, but rather to evoke through music the creepy otherworldliness of the flat, hot Texas landscape, remote and craggy with cedar underbrush, and to create a macabre setting wherein a John Larroquette voiceover would not be out of place. While the mission is different, the music and the Americana setting are similar to Pinetop Seven's reimaginings of silent films like The Wind and Laugh, Clown, Laugh. If the source material is much more notorious, Songs of Muerto County transcends its audacious gimmick because Puerto Muerto are interested neither in retelling the story through song (Alice's Chainsaw Massacree, anyone?) nor in explaining away the horrors perpetrated in the film (one of the 2003 remake's many fatal flaws). Instead, Meyer and Kelley take inspiration from the incidental music and evoke that wide-open claustrophobia-- all that room to run, but nowhere to hide. The first half of Songs of Muerto County sets up musical themes and tones that reappear throughout the album, suggesting that country music has the potential to be much creepier than the corporate metal that fills so many horror soundtracks. Over Kelley's dusty acoustic guitar melody, Meyer sings the introductory warnings of the lead-off track, ""Muerto County"", but mostly she relies on wordless aah-aah's, which subtly mimic a spooky pedal steel and imbue ""Ghostee"" and ""Walking"" with a nightfall dread. The second half of the album translates those melodies to more traditional settings, creating songs that have no narrative relation to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but would sound perfectly creepy crackling from the dash speakers of that soon-to-be-abandoned van or from a grimy gas station radio. ""What Have I Done?"" and ""Apple Pie"" are ramshackle C&W; songs well suited to Kelley's unpretentious vocals. He plugs in his guitar for ""Cherries"" and ""Road Song"", whose relentless, percussive riff hammers home the song's cautionary lyrics. Aside from ""Walking"", which is interrupted halfway through by a violent burst of noise, these songs benefit from a lack of special effects, a no-budget aesthetic that informs the simplicity of Meyer's waltzing ""Wondering"" and the knife-sharp strums of closer ""Goodbye"". There's a fine-line restraint to Songs of Muerto County: on one hand, Kelley and Meyer adhere to the traditional adage that a good soundtrack should not be more memorable than the film it supports. On the other, they aren't actually making a soundtrack, but a record that must stand on its own despite its inspiration. Occasionally, the album sounds too beholden to its source material-- music to dismember your victims by. At its best, however, Songs of Muerto County refrains from stating anything outright, the songs merely suggesting their emotional terrors and-- like the film-- leaving the hideous details to your imagination.","Tim Kelley and Christa Meyer's ""lost"" soundtrack to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

The Acrobat,Doveman,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb8abf31b7dc7155b61/1:1/w_160/ab05da64.jpg,2005-07-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2617-the-acrobat/,Swim Slowly,"Your enjoyment of Doveman will greatly depend on whether you can withstand a passionate and sustained conversation with a man talking directly into your ear. The placement of a dry, quietly sung vocal up front in a record's mix is invariably a gamble, or rather a hedge of one: Depending on the listener's mood, it may be read as DIY egalitarianism (reverb is, after all, an intimation of distance) or self-admiration. The Angels of Light records want you to feel the Booker's and bile on Michael Gira's breath; the French school currently embodied by, say, Keren Ann wants you to curl up in bed with every compressed sibilant and saliva snap. Doveman's Thomas Bartlett aims for neither grit nor seduction; he sings politely, quietly, in a halting high voice of a contrite ex-boyfriend mid-plea. A cynical first reaction would be ""emo"" or ""twee"" but, as Doveman's often fascinating debut progresses, Bartlett's complete lack of histrionics begins to register. He sounds hurt but never masochistic, dramatic but never vulgar; if this nice boy is this agitated, you begin thinking, something must really worry him. I better listen on. What you will hear: songs that glisten and sway like underwater plantlife, delivered by a pleasantly bonkers ensemble (the banjo is the featured instrument almost throughout, supported by violin and Thomas's own accomplished piano and organ). The keys handle most of the low end as well; the drums, of course, use every available technique to avoid sounding ""rock""-- brushes, muffled toms, weirdly distant cymbals. Live, Doveman's Dougie Bowne (a downtown legend who had drummed for Iggy Pop, among many others) plays a crash cymbal that had unpeeled into a long spiral. The track names-- ""House"", ""Clouds"", ""Drinking"", ""Dancing""-- suggest that the songs may have spent some time untitled; the compositions themselves, however, are elegant, tasteful, top-notch. Aware that they are nearing the border between indie pop and cocktail jazz (a border it might, in fact, behoove the authorities to open), Doveman occasionally retreat into light skronk and dissonance. They can't help it: the skronk sounds decorative, dissonance pretty. After the first two slow, mood-programming tracks, ""Cities"" takes the album's by now patented instrumentation and vocals on a swinging walk; the track is still leisurely by all human standards, but in the album's honey-drip universe, it's practically a club banger. The piano solo-- a pile-up of clashing ragtime licks reminiscent to my Russian ears of Sergei Kuryokhin-- is at once the song's apex and a tragicomic respite. The organ-driven ""Teacup"", which chastens Bowne's drums to approximate a cheap machine's plod and clop, swims with mysterious accents and mini-events, and wouldn't be out of place on a late-period Yo La Tengo LP. The album's undisputable tentpole, as evident from its length and strategic placement (on vinyl it would have been the Majestic Side One Closer) , is ""Boy + Angel"", which goes enough places to justify its eight minutes and wisely builds upon an urgent tom-tom throb to which one could listen for hours. The songs' lyrics, which Bartlett appears to holds secondary to the meta-story of his own choked-up delivery, suddenly come into sharper relief toward the end of the album. ""Drinking"" cuts loose with a direct and rueful chorus about a self-destructive paramour; the closing track spins out a suddenly crisp ""The edges hold together/ The center falls flat/ I can't blame it on the weather/ My heart's not an acrobat"" as things plink and groan and click and sigh toward oblivion. One wants to build a seedy yet expensive wine lounge somewhere in East Village just to be able to play this album around last call.","Self-proclaimed ""insomnia pop"" from sometimes Elysian Fields member Thomas Bartlett & co.

Already Platinum,Slim Thug,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b313d1975652139242/1:1/w_160/11085513.jpg,2005-07-12 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7820-already-platinum/,GeffenStar Trak,"Slim Thug is not a complicated man. The enormous Houston MC relies almost entirely on the intertwined lyrical themes of I'm Awesome and I'm Rich, sometimes dipping into I'll Kill You or I Don't Care About Women. But that's OK-- the anticipation surrounding Already Platinum, Slim's debut album, has nothing to do with the man's lyrical prowess. It has everything to do with his voice: a swollen, slurry, guttural drawl that rumbles under tracks like an earthquake and hammers vowels until any one word can rhyme with any other word. It's all hard consonants and long, luxurious vowels; he says ""ball till we fall"" like ""bowel till we fowl."" When DJs slow Slim's voice down, it barely sounds any different. Slim has bragged for years that he'd probably never record a solo album, just because no label could offer him the kind of money he made pushing mixtapes on Houston's independent circuit. ""Labels musta got tires of hearing me say 'fuck a deal'/ Cuz they put something in my pocket made a nigga chill,"" Slim raps on the intro to Already Platinum. But when Slim signed to Geffen, the label matched him up with the resurgent superproducers the Neptunes, and it didn't seem like a good match. The Neps have had a few monster hits in the past year (""Hollaback Girl"", ""Drop It Like It's Hot""), but most of their tracks have lost the gleaming, clattering swagger they once had, relying instead on bloodless synth lines and itchy, nattering drums. On ""Like a Boss"" and ""I Ain't Heard of That"", the first leaked Neptunes/Slim Thug collaborations, Slim's flow sounded awkwardly shoehorned into the cold, brittle tracks, allowing the rapper none of the breathing room that he'd had on the slow, gooey Houston funk tracks that had been his bread and butter. And parts of Already Platinum have no chemistry whatsoever. ""This Is My Life"", the Neptunes' attempt at greasy Houston funk, is tinny and overproduced, while ""Ashy to Classy"" is the Neps' attempt to jack Biggie's ""Juicy"", the pillowy quiet-storm guitars and inspirational lyrics dispassionately falling short on every possible level. The shockingly limp love-jam ""Miss Mary,"" produced by Cool & Dre, is even worse; nobody wants to hear Slim Thug saying ""To my nose, you're smelling just as sweet as a rose/ I wasn't impressed with them others, so you the one I chose"". But elsewhere on the album, Slim hits his stride. If his chemistry with the Neptunes seemed shaky at first, it comes together beautifully on dipping, floating hypnotic strut of ""Click Clack"" and the lighter-than-air gliding pianos and typewriter percussion of the title track, complete with a surprisingly non-shitty guest verse from Pharrell. Slim also shows impressive versatility on his work with other producers, murdering a gloomy, cinematic Sha Money XL beat on ""The Interview"" and a rippling, summery Jazze Pha beach-funk track on ""Incredible Feelin'"". But Slim still sounds best on tracks like ""Diamonds"" and the mixtape banger ""3 Kings"", both from Houston producer Mr. Lee. These tracks are classic Houston screw-- they sound like mid-90s G-Funk played on fucked-up, broken car stereos with the bass jacked up to seismic levels, the hooks coming out sick and damaged and wrong, slow and heavy drums slamming through the murk. Slim sounds perfectly at home on these tracks, making room for a jaw-dropping virtuoso Bun B guest spot, threatening crosstown rival Lil Flip, and smothering the tracks his creeping bottomless depth-charge snarl. On tracks like this, Slim sounds prehistoric, like he's always existed, like this voice has been echoing over canyons and through caves since before time began.","Slim Thug is not a complicated man.

Future Days / Soon Over Babaluma / Unlimited Edition / Landed,Can,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50413d1975652138e4f/1:1/w_160/8fda0211.jpg,2005-07-12 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11699-future-days-soon-over-babaluma-unlimited-edition-landed/,Spoon,"There are four small miracles in Can's ""Chain Reaction""/""Quantum Physics"", from 1974's Soon Over Babaluma. The first occurs at about 40 seconds into ""Chain Reaction"" when the 4/4 stomp of Jaki Liebezeit's drums line up with Holger Czukay's bass pulse, alongside tambourine and percolating drum machine; I realize that this song is closer to trance techno than the minimalist funk or psychedelic motorik of the band's earlier records. In fact, the first time I ever heard ""Chain Reaction"", I was mostly unfamiliar with trance, and wondered if Can had actually invented the music. I'd never read anything to that effect, but it seemed obvious they must have had at least a hand in its creation. In any case, the only music I've heard since that approached their primal, impressionistic romp has been by bonafide dancefloor shamans like the Orb or Orbital, or even Aphex Twin's ambient stuff. Of course, I loved Can a lot more: They seemed subtler and messier, like Claude Debussy's ghost tripping over a Mayan ruin mid-thought. The second miracle occurs at the 6:28 mark in ""Chain Reaction"", when the swirling mass of synth and Michael Karoli's brain-fried guitar solo is brutally interrupted by a chime and black void of metallic, echo-chamber ambience. The beat stays intact (Liebezeit couldn't stop playing that pulse on a bet), but the mood goes from proto-jam-band orgasm to stark ambience with drums of death. Had Terry Riley not nabbed the Phantom Band moniker for one of his records, Can could have stolen it here-- and Liebezeit did for one of his solo projects in the 1980s! Unlike virtually any other band on the planet, Can were able to straddle the line between primal and progressive, popular and avant-garde in a way that made both extremes seem like the best possible end for Western music. The third occurs five-and-a-half minutes into ""Quantum Physics"", when Irmin Schmidt's Alpha 77 synth cluster chord suddenly becomes a fully-fledged major one. By this point in the song, the raging, percussive momentum of the previous track has almost completely evaporated into only the hint of a beat, as if the spirit of the piece had long since been shot out into space, left to dissolve into what popular physics author Nick Herbert once described as ""quantumstuff""-- the one true matter of the universe, of which we and everything we see or feel is made. Schmidt lets his tones sustain, and I can hear the overtones forming, one by one, until the chord is more than just major. In fact, the physics of sound dictate that if you let a note ring long enough, you'll get the minor-7th harmonic, and eventually a 9th-- exactly the notes old Debussy liked to insert into chords to make them all pagan and erotic. The last miracle occurs as the song is fading away from us entirely, when even Liebezeit's drums have dried up and the only discernable sound comes from Schmidt's endlessly spiraling synthesizer overtones. Mid-period Can is arguably the band's most interesting because it witnesses them having to explore more than just the backbeat of experimental rock, more than just the ambience of the space music they helped create. ""Quantum Physics"" is what happens when discipline and intelligence rams head on with divine inspiration. It is understated and refined, but glowing with life. It's not the kind of song you put on to start a party, but if you want to send a few of your best friends home like angels, you'll put it on at the end. It sounds like the music of the spheres to me. Can had approached this territory before with 1973's Future Days. After the band's modest success with the ""Spoon"" in 1972 (buoyed by its use as the theme to a popular German gangster show), they were able to afford a short summer holiday. When they came back to record, it was a collective idyllic, sunshiny aura that most informed their efforts. The title track, fading in on the back of seaside ambience and distant accordion, was Can's smoothest production yet, sounding either like they'd successfully amputated the pulse and precision of Ege Bamyasi, added a lush veneer and forged a new kind of pop music, or somehow invented the greatest tropicalia known to man. Damo Suzuki's cooing (""You hide behind a borrowed chase / For the sake of Future Days"") never sounded so alluring, and Can's music had never seemed as sensuous or divorced from gravity. Likewise, the epic ""Bel Air"" featured Can at their most impressionistic, if not always focused. Czukay once described his band as an ""electric symphony group"", and the heavily edited and structured ""Bel Air"" betrays a dedication to long-form statements and an almost painterly sense of blended colors and landscapes. Following Future Days, Suzuki got married to a Jehovah's Witness and left the band. After trying out several singers, Can eventually decided to keep things to themselves for Soon Over Babaluma, as Karoli took over vocals in most cases, with Schmidt helping from time to time. Due to circumstances, the record sounds obviously transitional, and was in fact the last one Can would complete using their tried and true straight-to-stereo method, before upgrading to more modern, multi-track methods afterwards. However, even beyond the aforementioned ""Chain Reaction""/""Quantum Physics"" highlight, it's a good record. ""Dizzy Dizzy"" is something like Can's version of ska (kraut-skank?), and features the first of several future Karoli forays using violin, on which he's surprisingly competent. His refrain of ""got to get it up, got to get it over"" serves the insistent, space-bounce of the track, and though the band would misstep on world music attempts in later years, this was pretty interesting. The murky electro-bossa ""Come sta, La Luna"" is also cool, featuring Schmidt's vocals and ominous piano lines. Only ""Splash"" leaves me underwhelmed, seeming tired and directionless in comparison to the rest of the record. Unlimited Edition is the CD expansion of the Limited Edition LP, featuring various unreleased tracks from 1968 to 1974, all recorded in Can's private Inner Space studios. Given the nature of the collection, a general lack of cohesion is to be expected, but for my money, Unlimited Edition is one of the most underrated items in the band's catalog. From the heavenly climates of ""Gomorrha"" and ""Ibis"", to the more cutting, rock-edged tracks with Malcolm Mooney (""The Empress and the Ukraine King"", ""Mother Upduff"", ""Connection"", ""Fall of Another Year""-- all of which could have comprised a classic EP) to the sometimes bizarre, sometimes funny ""Ethnological Forgery Series"", wherein Can raid the world's various indigenous music and make stuff that would make both Steve Reich and Boredoms proud. And of course there's ""Cutaway"": an epic, spliced-together piece that might sound more at home on a Faust record than here. 1975's Landed was the first Can record to get what Czukay describes as a ""professional mix"", as the band upgraded to 16 tracks and had the opportunity to bring out many more layers of sound. However, what might have sounded like a godsend to fans craving as much Can magic as they could get didn't quite turn out as we expected. Gone were the epic, funky ambient songs or minimalist rock experiments in favor of some pretty straightforward jam-band tunes. ""Full Moon on the Highway"" bursts out of the gate with a deft pace and Karoli's thin, decidedly non-rock chipmunk chorus. Luckily, his guitar is front and center, though it was clear the band weren't playing space age physics music anymore. ""Half Past One"", ""Vernal Equinox"" and ""Hunters and Collectors"" are variations on the idea of bare-basic chord progression and high-speed beats serving as launching pads for lengthy solos. I give Can credit for having the chops to pull it off, but did I really need to hear them do it? ""Red Hot Indians"" is more interesting, sounding like bizarre tropical jazz-pop, and featuring Olaf Kübler from Amon Düül guesting on dual sax solos. The 13-minute sound-art closer ""Unfinished"" doesn't really fit with the rest of the record, but does at least give Can the chance to stretch out their most experimental ideas into 16 tracks, and is reminiscent of ""Cutaway"" or some of the more out-there moments on Tago Mago. Like the previous Mute remasters, these albums now sound incredible. Listening to ""Chain Reaction"", ""Gomorrha"", and ""Future Days"", I was constantly surprised at how clear everything sounded, as if the band had recorded all of this stuff in one fell swoop during an unbelievably inspired, marathon session. One of the great things about Can, even in their off moments, was the attention to detail and realization that the affect of each tiny moment in the course of a song can affect the momentum of the entire piece. No small miracles here: even if it's sad to think these albums represent Can's last great gasp, none of their moments have ever sounded better.",,8.8,
Sir Dark Invader vs. the Fanglord,Richard Buckner & Jon Langford,by: Stephen M.

And in the opposing corner is Jon Langford, aka the Fanglord, aka the Mekons Menace, the Waco Brothers Brawler. It's a match made not in heaven, but in Sally Timms's Chicago apartment, where in 2002 Buckner and Langford recorded eight of the nine songs on this one-off collaboration album, released on Langford's Buried Treasure Records. The title suggests there may have been some friendly competition involved, which seems almost inevitable given their distinct styles. Sir Dark Invader vs. the Fanglord pits Buckner's melting drawl against Langford's grainy vocals; Buckner's abstracted, introspective songwriting against Langford's demonstrative, outward-looking lyrics; Buckner's ragged beard against Langford's trimmed mustache. This amiable musical friction enlivens every song: pounding drums and punchy basslines jab at welterweight guitar melodies, and over the melee, Buckner and Langford move easily between lead and backing vocals and trade off instruments and solos almost on a whim. As a result, songs like the opener ""The Rolling of the Eyes"" and ""The Inca Princess"" generate brawling momentum-- the kind seldom associated with Buckner's solo material-- while tracks like ""Nothing to Show"" and the closer ""Do You Wanna Go Somewhere?"" sound battered and worn, but not necessarily defeated. The album is a volley of contradictions, a tossed-off collaboration (shelved for almost three years) that never sounds haphazard. The lighthearted aspects of the project-- songs like ""The Inca Princess"", the comic-book aliases, the photo-booth snapshots of both men that decorate the pixilated packaging-- disguise the gravity of the songs. ""Nothing to show for the things that I've done,"" Langford sings on the ruminative ""Nothing to Show"", ""There were places to go, and I had to choose this one."" Buckner takes over for the second verse, expressing an equally world-weary remorse. If they're pugilists on other songs, here they sound like hard-timers: singing ""We'll be lucky to leave/ Lucky to leave with our lives"", they sound like they're holding each other up, two drunks stumbling home from another long night at the bar. This feeling bridges the two-minute intermission, ""From Attic to Basement"", and continues on the standout ""Torn Apart"" and the raucous ""Inca Princess"". The former's tense rhythms echo the restlessness of its lyrics, as Buckner and Langfird share a rueful back-and-forth, singing the title over and over as the song winds down. ""The Inca Princess"" kicks up a barnstorming momentum as Langford describes a bar so tough that ""drinkin' and drivin' was almost mandat'ry."" By contrast, the conflicted lullaby ""No Tears Tonight"" and the abruptly abandoned ""Do You Wanna Go Somewhere?"" parse the isolation and the inspiration of a life devoted to music. ""I wanna wrap you up in music,"" Langford sings, then admits, ""But we both know that I got nothing/ Spent too much time playing in bands."" Taken together, these two tracks comprise a twist ending of sorts, revealing that Sir Dark Invader and the Fanglord have been fighting on the same side all along, battling the spectre of loneliness. The mix of celebration and commiseration on the album suggests a draw.","In one corner you have Richard Buckner, aka Sir Dark Invader, the Devotion + Doubt Demolisher, the Alt-Country Annihilator.

Tales From the Sitting Room,Stromba,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b4c0084474cd0c0a17/1:1/w_160/17a4e831.jpg,2005-07-12 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7821-tales-from-the-sitting-room/,Fat Cat,"Tales From the Sitting Room, the debut full-length from Stromba, twists expectations even after repeated listens. For listeners who caught the disco stomp of the ""Giddy Up"" single from last year, you'll be surprised to hear such a downtempo record heavy with the influence of dub. For those tuning in to hear a modern dub album, close listening reveals that most of this is played live, with reverberating drums and echoing samples introduced at just the right moments, adding a cunning electronic sheen to what's essentially a live jazz record. Even in a post-rock, post-trip-hop, post-whatever world, Stromba have blurred the line between producer and musician in subtle and occasionally stunning ways, and written some cool tracks to boot. The production team of James Dyer and Tom Tyler and their musical guests-- on trumpet, melodica, violin, other horns, and percussion-- are a detail-oriented bunch, crafting careful arrangements with small surprises in each. ""Swamp Donkey"" builds a slow-moving dervish out of African percussion before dropping off halfway into smooth wah-wah bass, kicking an extra bit of melody into their keen-eared cultural plundering. While ""Septic Skank"" and ""Manphibian"" are pure, creeping dub, the following ""Blue Skin"" starts with rollicking midtempo drums and trumpet over a watery drone, then introduces a pleading female vocal sample just before a steady bassline and distorted guitar, transforming dubby jazz into suspenseful soundtrack work. There's a few missteps, like the cloying nylon-string plucking of the closing track ""Jewell"", but it's the price paid for the diversity from track to track. It's a dabbler of a record, without the improvisation of jazz or the subtle shifts of techno, simply providing an assortment of great sounds. From the syncopated swing of ""Percolator"" to the horns that reach an atonal climax on ""Swings and Roundabouts"", Sitting Room is a soundtrack waiting for a movie. If anything, this record is a little too canny, robbing easy touchstones from the hippest genres. I envision Dyer and Tyler as two goatee-stroking trainspotters with swelled, distented craniums, able to assimilate incidental music from any source into a perfect pastiche. However, Sitting Room is grounded by their taste as producers and by the album's dogged restraint. Aside from the reappearance of ""Giddy Up"", it's consistently downtempo and even through its twists and turns holds a little something back, letting the listener fill in the blank.","Tales From the Sitting Room, the debut full-length from Stromba, twists expectations even after repeated listens.

The Best of Femi Kuti,Femi Kuti,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4babf31b7dc7155ca7/1:1/w_160/c053dfcc.jpg,2005-07-12 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4600-the-best-of-femi-kuti/,Wrasse,"Being born of greatness has its perks, I'm sure, but it seems it's mostly a burden. How does Jakob Dylan even get up in the morning knowing he's doomed to be judged against his father every time he writes a song or cuts a record? There are hundreds of children of musical giants roaming around the industry these days, working with varying degrees of success to carve out their own names separate from their parents-- Zak Starkey, the Lennon half-brothers, Moreno Veloso, Eric Mingus, and the various offspring of Charlie Haden, to name just a few. Femi Kuti is in this same position, perhaps dealing with an even more insurmountable legacy. As far as African music goes, his father Fela wasn't just Bob Dylan; to continue an imperfect analogy, he was also Bob Marley and John Coltrane, and that doesn't even take into account his political impact. Femi of course is acutely aware of his father's towering legacy, and seems content to extend it, realizing that trying to equal it is impossible, regardless of genes. Femi had something of a head start, playing sax in his father's Egypt 80 bands for close to two decades, assuming leadership of it during his father's various politically motivated imprisonments. Though he had performed his own right for years, he only released his first solo album, Shoki Shoki, in 1998, a year after Fela's death from AIDS, in effect picking up the torch his father finally had to let fall. In the time since then he's recorded another album, contributed to records by Common (Like Water for Chocolate) and Rachid Taha (Made in Medina), opened up the Afrika Shrine, a successor to his father's iconic Lagos nightclub, and founded an organization aimed at galvanizing and educating working-class Africans, all of this between multiple world tours. So to say he's a busy, conscientious guy is something of an understatement. He may be the son of a legend, but Femi Kuti has paid his dues to arrive where he is, and now Wrasse Records has released this compilation of material drawn from his two studio albums as an introduction. Given that it's a 70-minute disc drawing from only two albums, you can imagine that it includes the bulk of both records and it does. Being familiar with both records, I really can't think of any of the usual wounded-critic objections to the track selection-- a better introduction to Femi's modern take on Afrobeat isn't in the offing. While it's true that Femi basically plays modern Afrobeat, his approach differs quite a lot from his father's. Femi's songs tend to be much shorter, for one thing, with the focus more heavily on the dance elements of the music than the jazz elements. Femi's lyrics deal primarily with the present-tense problems of African societies, with a special emphasis on corruption, but unlike his father, he stays his tongue against ordinary Africans adopting Western ideals and specific entities like the Nigerian army. In other words, it's not as potent as Fela, but it's a fair bit more accessible, and anyone just looking for a nasty, horn-drenched groove to flip out to will find it here as well. The five songs that open the disc hail from Shoki Shoki, and the sound is bright and right up in your face. The groove of ""Truth Don Die"" is insane, and one of Femi's best horn themes stabs out over the top of it with slashing ferocity, while ""What Will Tomorrow Bring?"" slides by on a slower rhythm and allows Femi's vocal more room to show his range. ""Beng Beng Beng"" was a huge pan-African hit, and it's impossible not to see why: It's catchy as all get-out, and Femi's slippery vocal is one of his few to focus more on personal relationships (specifically, getting it on) than political realities. The remaining tracks cover 2001's Fight to Win, with cameos from Mos Def and Common highlighting the far more politically charged and biting content of the songs. The arrangements are still hard and wickedly funky, but the band plays more loosely and explores more varied territory (to hear them really get into it, check out Live at the Shrine). ""'97"" directly addresses Fela's funeral and the death of Femi's sister Sola, with the band pulling back for a haunting breakdown where Femi calls out the poor medical care his sister received. ""Stop AIDS"" follows up on the theme with an impassioned plea for more attention to the disease that's eating Africa alive. All told, it seems that Femi Kuti is doing fine working in his father's wake, carving out his own sound and finding his political footing in a changed Africa that still bears too many echoes of its past. His father's shadow will always remain-- that's just the reality of it-- but Femi is a worthy successor to that legacy.","Despite a limited output, Fela's son gets a comp-- one featuring Common and Mos Def.

Arcade Fire EP,Arcade Fire,by: Stephen M.

Without taking into account its fertile propagation via file-sharing networks, this new ""official"" edition of the record essentially marks its third release: The band recorded and released it themselves pre-hype in 2003, selling it at shows and through their website. The next year, Merge Records began offering that same homemade EP through their website, in an attempt to sate the demand of an audience that had quickly grown obsessed with the group's full-length debut, Funeral. Now, in 2005, Merge is doing the inevitable: releasing a remastered and repackaged version of these seven songs, and finally putting it in stores, where it arguably ought to have been all along. With its convoluted history, this EP is difficult to position in relation to Funeral, which looms over it like a monumental obelisk. While it's now nearly impossible to hear The Arcade Fire on its original 2003 terms, a comparison between the two records proves potentially condescending (from my notes: ""... finds the band still unsure of their capabilities""). Listeners who didn't special-order the EP from Merge last year and are hearing the remastered versions of these songs for the very first time should, if nothing else, find it revelatory, the first notes of a band confident enough to stage an evacuation of women, children, and old folks during the coda of standout ""No Cars Go"". But for the rest of us, Funeral provides a new context as unflattering as fluorescent lighting. No matter how patronizing the comment parenthesized above may sound, it still proves mostly true: The EP shows a band still finding its strengths and developing its sound, unsure of its talent for cathartic drama. That is, they still sound like they did-- or will-- on Funeral, only less so. The build-ups seem either less patient or less directed, the quick changes more deliberate, the structures more top-heavy, and the payoffs ultimately less rewarding. The band generates tension and energy, but don't always recognize the best way to unravel it. ""My Heart Is an Apple"" creates a subdued atmosphere for Win Butler's soulful vocals, but there's no strong melody to anchor them, and as a result, the song flatlines. Likewise, ""Headlights Look Like Diamonds"" has all the elements of the anthems that made Funeral so compelling, but never achieves the same effect. The homemade quality of these tracks, which has become an Arcade Fire trademark on par with their homespun album packaging, gives them a gritty immediacy, but the remastering only amplifies the problems the band would resolve with Funeral. Still, it's important to point out that the EP is more than just dress rehearsal for the album. There are moments that not only hint at the heights of that album, but scale such heights themselves. ""Vampire/Forest Fire"" achieves the right balance of build-up and release: Butler's vocals start measured and empathic, growing louder and stronger as the keyboards circle the chorus and the sound climactically explodes. But most of these tracks have more modest aims than such airy catharsis and achieve them through well-considered instrumentation: the piano flutters that lifts ""I'm Sleeping in a Submarine"", the dodgy guitar melody that weaves through ""Old Flame"", the melodic bassline and jolting drumbeat on ""No Cars Go"", the campfire percussion of ""The Woodland National Anthem"". What connects The Arcade Fire so inextricably to Funeral-- and what makes the band so distinct-- is its tone of youthful conspiracy (the EP is known unofficially as Us Kids Know). On ""No Cars Go"" and ""Vampire/Forest Fire"", Butler and wife Régine Chassagne write in a coded language explicitly for rock's original audience: kids. But while they infuse the songs with a dread and drama that reaches an adolescent intensity and bleeds into every track, they never retreat to a romanticized notion of childhood. As Funeral suggested and this EP proves, the Arcade Fire know that world is as treacherous as its adult mirror-- an insight encoded in the band's genetic make-up and a motivating force since striking their first note.",,6.8,
Five,Circus Devils,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5dc13d1975652139062/1:1/w_160/438cd223.jpg,2005-07-11 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1480-five/,Recordhead,"Of the notorious Fading Captain series of Guided By Voices-related material, Circus Devils remain the most obtuse of Robert Pollard's side projects. That's likely because Pollard isn't primary songwriter, his vocals instead added to music created by extended GBV-family member Todd Tobias. With Guided By Voices dissolved and Pollard's next solo album, From A Compound Eye, in release-date limbo, fans may feel the urge to scramble for this record to tide them over to a more official Pollard release. Guys, girls, Postal Blowfishes, and fanatics: Take a pass on this one. Part of the Circus Devils' appeal is just how far it sounds from Guided By Voices. Good or bad, it's a whole new context for Pollard's musings, and that's certainly true of Five. Where previous releases saw them balancing eerie psychedelia with more traditional rock songs, Five opens with string-imitating keyboards, setting the tone for a distinctly non-rock record. Expect a lot of beat-poet Bob without any of the breaks into standard rock songs that previous Devils albums provided. The early tracks are the most bewildering, with disorienting loops of noise and ambient keyboards, through which snippets of soft rock float in and out while Pollard does his best to sound like someone else. He sings with a deep and strangely affected voice over the jaw harp percussion and synth bass of ""Look Between the Eyes"" and the mush-mouthed ""Atheroid Vogue"". Despite his lyricist-only role, Pollard wedges his personality into the later tracks. There's some oddball charm in the lumbering fuzzbox groove of ""Animal Motel"", and ""We Taught Them Rock and Roll"" is the apes learning from the monolith in 2001, but with beginner guitar riffs coming out of a shitty practice amp instead of a monolith (there's still plenty of Chewbacca-like animal screams). Elsewhere, the sluggish ambience of ""Tell Them the Old Man is Coming Down"" or ""Dolphins of Color"" recall the strained, world-weary introspection of GBV's major-label days. But much of the thrill of the Fading Captain series is sifting for those unexpected nuggets of gold. Compile them all for the Ultimate Pollard/GBV Mix, and it'll unlock the gates to Paradise and push you right through, past a St. Peter who's shotgunning a beer and throwing up the horns. Let me get you there that much faster: None of those songs are on Five. There aren't pleasant any surprises here along the lines of Harold Pig Memorial's ""Bull Spears"". What is here is a lot of work-- 23 tracks to get through without any familiar footholds. If you haven't read it a dozen times before, here or elsewhere, there's just a shit-ton of music with Pollard's name on it. It's intimidating and exhausting to follow, and even compared to the other Circus Devils efforts, Five is lacking. Maybe a hardcore fan will find more to love than I did, but for the uninitiated, start anywhere but here.","Yet another Robert Pollard-related release.

Snake's Got a Leg,Sunset Rubdown,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6af9d034d5c69bf35cc/1:1/w_160/651d5160.gif,2005-07-11 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7816-snakes-got-a-leg/,Global Symphonic,"One of the byproducts of the great backlash against indie rock that occurred in the early '00s is the notion that lo-fi is an illegitimate tool, the go-to cover-up for artists short on cash, patience, and ideas. It's an understandable aversion, given the long trail of refuse left in the wake of Slanted & Enchanted and Bee Thousand; bands seemed to think a respectable career could be bought with a four-track and a whole lotta reverb. But it's also easy to forget what an effective tool the home-studio process can be when used properly-- creating unexpected, unique sounds and enveloping the music in an intimate blanket. Spencer Krug's project under the name Sunset Rubdown seems to be aware of the tightrope that needs to be walked with lo-fi production, but he can't help ending up on the wrong side more often than not. Krug can be found spending his days with animal-themed acts Frog Eyes and Wolf Parade, but saves his nights for recording sparse, echo-dipped ballads for this moniker, at least one of which has already been recycled for one of his other bands' more-fidelitous recordings. Snake's Got a Leg therefore seems a little bit like a solo project, a little bit like demos, and the music contained within is similarly torn between fully realized and undercooked. The elements Krug makes most prominent in his bedroom studio are his own pinched, Bowie-esque voice and a variety of keyboards, both outlined in a thick border of fuzz by heaping helpings of reverb. The echobox treatment does a good job of filling in the gaps left by the spare arrangements, and gives what are presumably rather normal instruments an extraterrestrial flair, as with the organ or Rhodes or Two-buck Casio that ""I'll Believe in Anything You'll Believe in Anything"" floats on. Pretty-okay acoustic & singin' tracks like ""Stadiums and Shrines"" or ""I Know the Weight of Your Throat"" might still sound like a guy in a basement with a tape-recorder, but at least the skillful application of lo-fi makes the song sound like it was made in a haunted basement, and sometime in the 1920's to boot. Unfortunately, the audio environment also makes it very difficult to tell whether there's anything of substance beneath the sea of hiss. Krug's Ziggy Stardust vocals will probably make or break the album for most people; I can already see the ""for fans of Arcade Fire & Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!"" stickers. If you can't swallow this kind of over-dramatized singing, there's little to distract you on Snake's Got a Leg, as Krug doesn't add much more than the occasional off-rhythm handclap or ghostly accordion to the piano and guitar accompaniments. Even instrumental tracks won't satisfy: the musicbox-like ""Sol's Song"" is relentlessly cyclical, and the promisingly electronic ""Cecil's Bells"" fragments and fades out before achieving anything more than making weird noises. But the production of weird noises oftentimes seem the main goal of Sunset Rubdown, with the rare intrusions of solid songwriting (""Snake's Got a Leg II"", ""I'll Believe in Anything"") feeling as accidental as the distorted notes. Unlike most lo-fi artists, determining whether Krug is a shallow talent hiding behind his Tascam can be somewhat objectively tested, thanks to the Wolf Parade material seeping out this summer. In that professionally recorded setting, Krug's songs sound simultaneously less compelling and more complete than the material on Sunset Rubdown-- Wolf Parade are another of the above-average indie-compendium type acts we can't help falling in love with, but the proper studio reins in some of the weirdness of Krug's yelps. Ultimately, however, with the two album's near-simultaneous release, the more accessible Wolf Parade likely makes the rough-edged lo-fi experiments of Sunset Rubdown a mere novelty throwback.","Lo-fi album from Spencer Krug of Wolf Parade and Frog Eyes.

North Pole,The Primary 5,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19db1335d7bf16982dd/1:1/w_160/178814df.gif,2005-07-11 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6578-north-pole/,Microindie,"Paul Quinn once enjoyed a business-hours beatkeeping gig with daylight-beamin' Glaswegian melody-worshipers Teenage Fanclub. On his the Primary 5 debut, North Pole, he also aims to created dangerously infectious meadow-pop. Here Quinn, with help from multi-instrumentalist Ryan Currie, among others, lays on more blue-sky lovey-dove on the warm-not-Arctic North Pole. The Primary 5's sound, like the Fannies', is-- to keep it proper and indie-- Big Star, Sloan, the Raspberries. But more accurately, it's practically Gin Blossom-y (albeit through the Clientele's classicist gauze). And that's not just because brilliant opener ""Comin' Home"" mentions ""gin"" and ""blossoms"" before announcing, plaintively but seeping with driblets of molten joy, ""I only want you here by my side."" OK, so maybe ""honey you make me feel so good you're the girl I've waited for my whole life through you're the one"" on finale ""Field of Dreams"" breaches my Green Bay-hat threshold. Banal lyrics bug me, no foolin'. Similarly, penultimate hymn ""Shine On"" is too Pure Prairie League for taste. But throughout the rest of North Pole, Quinn's songwriting is unpretentiously immaculate, rivaling ageless ingénue Jonathan Richman in the ability to confect near-perfect pop from deceptively facile-seeming bubblegum base and sporkfuls of sugar. On ""I'll Lay You Down"", laden with woodsy CSNY harmonies, the refrain ""I'll lay you down before you fall"" may just be a (more?) poetic way to say ""I'll never let your head hit the bed/ Without my hand behind it"". But I'm ready to tell Quinn I'm free Friday night and open to going pillow-shopping. ""Everybody Knows It Hurts"" has the graceful maturity of Lou Barlow's Emoh, ""Without You"" has killer Byrdsian riffs and crushingly childlike adoration, and ""What Am I Supposed to Do"" converses like real-life flirting partners given the benefit of dizzying pop hook-smithing. On ""Happy"", Quinn exclaims (happily): ""When the sun comes up it makes me happy/ When the sun goes down it makes me blue/ But when the stars shine bright and light up the night/ ...You know that makes me happy too."" Straight-lined. More elegant than it looks.","Side project from Teenage Fanclub drummer Paul Quinn.

Disaffected,Piano Magic,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06ec0084474cd0bfb92/1:1/w_160/93b6f3c6.jpg,2005-07-11 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6287-disaffected/,Darla,"Early this year Piano magic released Opencast Heart, a nice four-song EP that found leader Glen Johnson setting his songs in front of a completely electronic backdrop. Following that fruitful experiment Piano Magic return with Disaffected, an overwhelmingly song-oriented record built mostly around typical rock band instrumentation. And it's a good one-- perhaps Piano Magic's strongest full length since Low Birth Weight. Glen Johnson's always-meticulous attention to sonic detail this time focuses on the emotional possibilities of guitar tone. The snarling leads in ""You Can Hear the Room"" allude to that point when the gauzy beauty of shoegaze meets the drop-D heft of grunge, and though the lyrics talk about ""the whisper of the pipes"" this is one of the loudest songs Piano Magic has recorded. Another massive guitar swell closes ""Love & Music"", reflecting the song's simple theme (""love and music 'til I die"") with a sexy wall of trebly chords. Much is made of the influence of the 4AD and Factory labels on Piano Magic, and it's hard to hear the evocative echo-chamber tone of ""Night of the Hunter"" as anything but channeled Duritti Column. On the simple ballad ""I Must Leave London"" Johnson's acoustic is wet and lush as Hyde Park grass in a November drizzle. Disaffected can fairly be called a rock album, but two of the most interesting songs depart from the template. The title track is the only song with female vox, sung this time by Angèle David-Gillou, and through its main section it weds acoustic guitars to a simple drum machine beat. The four-minute coda, however, allows the electronic percussion to take the lead, as beats grow progressively syncopated and the rest of the music drops out save an occasional vocal sample. Even dancier is ""Deleted Scenes"", which appears halfway through and is then reprised as the record's final track in an extended remix. Possibly Disaffected's best song, ""Deleted Scenes"" is icy new wave with a classicist's reverence for the feel and clarity of the early 80s originals, from Johnson's Bernard Sumner croon to the primitive synths and cheesy (but effective) vocodered chorus refrain. The extended mix is the one to listen for, with a funky electronic drum jam dominating the final three minutes that playfully shuffles the sort of quasi-industrial percussion hits Depeche Mode used in ""People are People"". Interesting thing about Piano Magic is that while the band's overall aesthetic-- music, lyrics and visual presentation-- is so well defined and consistent, the actual records are all over the place. We know we're going to get sad introspection, that the songs will take place in winter, that the production will somehow bring to mind the word ""ethereal,"" and the packaging will look good. The details, however, are always up in the air, which possibly explains the band's inconsistency. This time out the pieces land in a satisfying place.","After a few fruitful experiments, Piano Magic return with an overwhelmingly song-oriented record built mostly around typical rock band instrumentation.

The Understanding,Röyksopp,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c7ea9e61561daa4b1d/1:1/w_160/46559bbe.jpg,2005-07-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6861-the-understanding/,AstralwerksWall of Sound,"Good for Röyksopp: This is the first time in a while that a group's gone into the studio and come back doing exactly what I wanted them to. This Norwegian duo's first album, Melody A.M., was absolutely impeccable, sure-- all swishy drum shuffle, downtempo head-nod, and endless attention to detail. But it still felt like they were holding something back, proofreading every snare crack but keeping the big ideas in their pockets. This time around, incredibly, they've gone all free rein on the extra-deep epics they used to save for remixes of other people's pop tracks. This time around, it's shades of MRI's dark sparkle, Luomo's non-stop depth, and the same maximalist guest-vocaled dance-pop extravagance on Basement Jaxx's Kish Kash. Except where the Jaxx go for jerky funk and sample kung-fu, Röyksopp enjoy long, silky builds suitable late-night highway cruising, anyplace dim and wide and beautiful. (This, after all, sounds suspiciously like a break-up album, and one that finishes off with more than minutes of Eno-ambient.) Jaxx will go overboard with the bells and whistles and constant motion, until three minutes' listening leaves you kind of drained; when The Understanding does the same thing, it's by way of luscious synth pads swelling gradually out to fill every millimeter of studio space. Some of this album's best moments have a keyboard-aquarium ambition that rivals anything from the early-80s charts, and if you've ever noticed how much the Knife's Karin Dreijer sounds like Cyndi Lauper, you'll get actual ""Time After Time"" flashbacks from her fabulous guest spot on ""What Else Is There?"" So it gets lush, especially with the boys getting heavy on the songwriting and the singing. (Turns out Erlend Øye doesn't have an interesting voice-- every boy in Bergen sounds like that.) Come at it the wrong way, and ""Only This Moment"", the single, can feel like a pile of frosting with only a cupcake inside. Hit it right, though, and it's astral, a subliminal trance anthem with perfect vocal splashes by Kate Havnevik (in reality) and arrangements by Mark Knopfler (in my head). ""Circuit Breaker"" is a little more straightforward, crooning its way up to that throbbing, running-in-place Röyksopp club-track peak. It's the tail end that really thrills, with Havnevik cooing like Alison Goldfrapp used to do for Orbital, and some acid synth scribbling it all out to the euphoric sunrise. Because of course they're great at this: Give these guys some trebly vintage drum samples and a dreamy vocal and they're all set to make it swish and kick. Personal-favorite ""49 Percent"" rides those trademark Röyksopp ""breaks"" tick-tocking under a two-note soul vocal from Get Physical's Chelonis R. Jones, straight up into some tense, free-floating territory; these guys have a gift for holding a track right at that beautiful, pulsing point where it's about to break loose but can't, and there's no better place for a good singer to hang out and swoon. It doesn't hurt that the flat tick-tock edges so seamlessly up into its chord patterns, Exhibit Z that Röyksopp are just plain good technicians with this stuff. The vocal-free tracks scattered through here are as much of a change from the sun on the last album: It's ""Röyksopp's Night Out"" stuff, sometimes even deeper and lost-in-spacier than the vocal spots. ""Alpha Male"" kicks a few of this year's rock moves, but it can't help making them rush instead of stomp. A couple of slow-funk touches give you a foothold on the earth (see ""Someone Like Me""), but the vibe can still come close to the Marianna Trench pumped full of meringue. Don't worry too much if the first headphone listen puts you to sleep: That's just your ears overloading and your brain drowning, happily and temporarily. The best part is that this album has Röyksopp being a lot more Röyksopp than the last one. If bits of Melody A.M. had them sounding all masterful and immaculate but not entirely league-of-their-own, this one does a lot to correct that. Meaning this is the one that puts them firmly and officially up there in the top tier of the dance-music crossover-album crowd, up with the Daft Punks and, umm, Basement Jaxxes. Really: Good for them. ","Good for Röyksopp: This is the first time in a while that a group's gone into the studio ...

Jesüs Chryst,The Peppermints,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19cb1335d7bf16982da/1:1/w_160/9b6b7b03.gif,2005-07-10 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6577-jesus-chryst/,Paw Tracks,"Just to give everybody involved the benefit of the doubt, one has to speculate that the Peppermints must be an absolutely devastating live act. Otherwise it's difficult to fathom what (besides sheer devoted friendship) might've prompted the Animal Collective to release the miserably shoddy trash-punk of Jesüs Chryst on their usually reliable Paw Tracks imprint. Though the label is clearly no stranger to unkempt, lo-fi recordings, there is none of the Animal Collective's beatific tribalism or even the homely charm of Ariel Pink's warped outsider pop on Jesüs Chryst. Instead the Peppermints specialize in a deliberately amateurish, almost quaintly anachronistic form of self-described ""barfy"" DIY punk that sounds gorged on G.G. Allin and Killed by Death comps. And though there's nothing inherently wrong with that, there's likewise nothing offered on this album that suggests the group has either the ability or the inclination to sculpt their slapdash rawk into anything innovative or distinctive. Originally assembled in the San Diego area in 1997, the quartet of Lil G'Broagfran, M. Ron Hubbard, Grim Graham, and Ms. Hot Chocolate have not wasted any time in the intervening years doing anything as pedestrian as honing their songcraft or rehearsing. Jesüs Chryst is the Peppermints' second full-length following 2003's Sweettooth Abortion, and was largely recorded by Hot Snakes' Gar Woods. Plowing through 18 tracks in a merciful 29 minutes, the album is an unholy blur of gracelessly screeched female vocals and disappointingly spindly guitars, at points recalling a lazier Melt Banana but utterly lacking that group's venomous precision and power. As the album's title and songs like ""Sexy Total Fuck"" or the lustful lament ""Cousin"" suggest, much of Jesüs Chryst's brief running time is spent attempting to make offense a skill, but there's little here that'll outrage anyone except the same stripe of Christian conservative who might protest the presence of a vampire puppet on ""Sesame Street"" teaching children to count. Besides, nearly all of the vocals here are delivered in a uniform shriek that renders most lyrics completely unintelligible, although on such exceptions as the chirpy ""Onion Salad"", lines like ""Take your clothes off/ Get molested/ It's festive/ Read the menu/ Take your nephew"" might indicate we're not missing much. The opening ""Yellow Rain""-- which features a barbed twang suggesting a Ricky Wilson-penned B-52's track plagued by rowdy vandals-- delivers a solid minute of innocuously scruffy diversion, as does the burly noise of the pounding ""Rabid Frogs"". The glassy drone of ""Santorum"" provides the album its most intriguing change-up, but the bulk of Jesüs Chryst is likely to appeal only to the least discriminating punk palates, solely restricted to those who find the Peppermints' uncompromising crudity to be a virtue.","San Diego trash-punk band makes its debut on Animal Collective's Paw Tracks label.

Over a minimal bass pulse and a few finger-snaps, the Ying Yang Twins turned down the volume on their gravelly crunk howling to whisper intense X-rated come-ons: ""Hey, bitch, wait till you see my dick/ I'ma beat that pussy up."" Sexually exploitative hip-hop is nothing new, but this track's air of menace and complete lack of subtlety made it the last straw for more than a few listeners of both genders, a point where they could no longer excuse the casual misogyny in rap music. On the internet, sides formed. Did ""beat the pussy up"" refer to rape or rough sex? Were the whispers threats or seduction? Was it a joke? If it were, would that excuse it? If you're looking for answers, United State of Atlanta isn't going to provide any. ""Wait"" is presented as part of a mid-album sex trilogy, followed by the even nastier spoken-not-sung track ""Pull My Hair"" and the awful quiet-storm slow jam ""Bedroom Boom"", and the three tracks are divided by skits of women with alert, precise speaking voices using spoken-word cadences talking about how they want to get fucked, as if the Twins are saying that intelligent women like this stuff, so it's OK. We also get ""Live Again"", a gliding, melodic mid-tempo track with a hook from (of all people) Maroon 5's Adam Levine, wherein the Twins paint a picture of a woman forced by economic circumstance into a job stripping, hoping to escape every day. And then there's ""Hoes"", where the Twins and female guest Jacki-O talk about hating hoes, with one Twin assuring women, ""If you a bitch and you hate a bitch, you can sing this shit, too!"" There's a lso a song about the inhumanities of the prison system, a bluesy track about the dehumanizing effects of poverty, a song about the Twins' love for each other, a song about Jesus, and a whole lot of songs instructing strippers on how to dance. So. Um. Fuck. Can we talk about the beats yet? Because the beats on U.S.A. are really something. Collipark provides almost all the album's tracks, lacing the Twins' bluesy, throaty voices with gleaming, futuristic jacked-up electro. The best tracks repeat their hooks enough to turn them into mantras, bass kicks exploding and maddeningly simple keyboard lines worming their way into your frontal lobe, Miami bass and Chicago house run through extremely expensive sequencers and morphing into a radiant space-age bounce. It's first-rate club music, and first-rate club music is always worth your attention. People shouldn't feel like they have to excuse or get past ""Wait""-- it's an entirely personal decision. If you feel OK about the track, you'll find that U.S.A. is a good-not-great Southern rap album, overlong and weighted down by too many inept slow tracks but boasting enough furious, kinetic dance tracks to make it worth your money. If you don't, that's fine. Your life isn't going to be any poorer without this album.","Speaking softly and enjoying a surprise hit, the YYTs aim to capitalize on their ""Wait"" notoriety.

The band makes such monumentally icy music that I can't imagine primary colors having anything to do with it-- this music is washed-out amber, fuzzy off-white, glimmering silver, lacking sharp contrast and exhalting the distances between sounds. It's an approach Auburn Lull have taken throughout their career, and it's yielded a body of work that could be easily criticized as homogenous-- indeed most people won't need more than one of their records. Without paying close attention, it's easy not to notice the passage of tracks and the subtle shifting of moods and textures, but that's also what makes this retrospective of the band's non-LP material so satisfying. The songs may be drawn from across a decade, but they have a shared aesthetic. Personalities of individual musicians are beside the point in this music. Guitars, bells, synths, even vocals and drums coalesce into a diaphanous whole where melodies move in languid waves and rhythm is often more subliminal than obvious. Take ""TI-99"", for instance: Sean Heenan lays down a web of oscillator-generated drones, creating a billowy breath of a song whose textures are not terribly unlike the ones created with guitars elsewhere on the set. ""A Harbored Distance"" and ""Steady Light"" are more traditional songs, ground in reverb-soaked drums rhythms and straightforward vocal melodies, but both have that smeared Auburn Lull approach that draws everything hazily toward the other elements. ""Van Der Graaf"" has a slightly more metallic texture than its counterparts, a darker brushed steel tone that sets it slightly apart. The biggest stand-out, though, is ""Rural Divide"", a stunning track that's among the band's best to date. Quite unlike most of the band's catalog, the song features a prismatic midsection that sets a muffled sample of a woman speaking amidst swirling somethings that sound like a cross between electric piano, Tomorrowland synths, and e-bowed guitars. Auburn Lull make a beautiful noise, and if you already have one of their albums and are looking for more, you'll love what you hear on this. It's also not a bad place to start, but I'd suggest for Alone I Admire for that purpose. But Regions Less Parallel demonstrates how having a limited signature sound isn't necessarily a negative, so long as a band realizes the many places it can travel within those limits.","Darla compiles the dream pop band's early works and rarities.

The Psychedelic Sounds of... / I Have Always Been Here Before,13th Floor ElevatorsRoky Erickson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a55e6ef95969321266/1:1/w_160/2ea6121d.jpg,2005-07-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11855-the-psychedelic-sounds-of-i-have-always-been-here-before/,International Artist,"The tragic irony behind Roger Kynard ""Roky"" Erickson's vaunted legacy as the father of psychedelic rock is that the very things that make him so important to so many fans and that keep him prominent in so many listeners' memories also ensured him a hard life spent in sanitariums and studios. Granted, for many that hard life is an integral part of his cachet: Arrested in 1969 and charged with possession, Erickson pleaded insanity rather than face jail time, and was committed to Rusk State Hospital. As legend has it, his mind was so devastated by the shock therapies and medications that he spent the rest of his life battling serious mental illness that left him easy prey for unscrupulous record promoters (who had him sign away his royalties for numerous reissues) and sabotaged almost every attempt at a comeback. There are, of course, scores of 1960s cautionary tales, but the music Erickson helped to make and the lifestyle he promoted with the 13th Floor Elevators explicitly advocated drug use as mind expansion, as true spiritual freedom-- a bunk idea he shared with Jim Morrison, although even at his most obtuse, Erickson never descended to the empty-headed blathering and lounge-act crooning that were the hallmarks of the celebrated Lizard King. Erickson's psychedelia was not passive aural wallpapers-- all pretty shapes and colors to listen to while tripping-- but an active force of social, musical, and psychological change. Aside from the infamous album starter ""You're Gonna Miss Me"", which Erickson wrote for his previous band the Spades before rerecording with the 13th Floor Elevators, The Psychedelic Sounds is awash in narcotic philosophy. And in case you miss it, Tommy Hall explains it all in his original liner notes. However, what makes The Psychedelic Sounds powerful 40 years later isn't its questionable philosophy but, as the title makes clear, its psychedelic sound. The 13th Floor Elevators were a remarkable band: Erickson's wild-man vocals create an atmosphere where unfettered mayhem reigns. Stacy Sutherland's piercing guitar puts a dark mood on ""Roller Coaster"" and ""Reverberation (Doubt)"", while drummer John Ike Walton ties it all together. It's a dynamic that's even more pronounced on the eight live tracks on this UK reissue, which were recorded in San Francisco following the album's release. Their covers of Solomon Burke's ""Everybody Needs Somebody to Love"", the Beatles' ""The Word"", and even their take on that '60s live staple ""Gloria"", are anything but placid drugs trips or by-the-numbers re-creation; instead, the songs get the full psychedelic treatment as the Elevators play them like they're handling snakes. As with any historical legacy, however, Erickson's reputation as the father of psychedelia is largely oversimplified. He was a late addition to the 13th Floor Elevators, which was the brainchild of Tommy Hall. Hall's acid poetry informs every song on The Psychedelic Sounds (aside from ""You're Gonna Miss Me"", Erickson's lone contribution). And, perhaps most important, it was Hall who plugged in his jug and provided the psychedelic sound that evokes the chemical weightlessness of a trip. It's the wiggedly-wiggedly of a dream sequence, the sound of your hands melting or of a dimensional door squeaking open. That the 13th Floor Elevators could translate that concept into an aural sensation is perhaps the root of their reputation and would have been impossible without Hall. Erickson, however, undoubtedly was a creative force in the band, as a vocalist on Psychedelic Sounds and also as a songwriter on the follow-up, Easter Everywhere. Selections from those two albums, as well as from subsequent aborted comebacks, are collected on the two-disk I Have Always Been Here: The Roky Erickson Story, which is, unbelievably, the first overview of his long, strange career. Erickson's is a long career to capture on only two disks, but Shout! Factory makes judicious use of the space not only to provide a chronology of Erickson's development over four decades, but also to paint him as a sort of outsider artist rather than as a victim. Emphasizing Erickson's solo output over his reputation-making Elevators material, the collection includes only a handful of tracks from The Psychedelic Sounds and Easter Everywhere. ""Slip Inside This House"" is a masterpiece of psychedelic inventiveness, a spacey blues jam that circles back on itself and eats its tail. On ""I Had to Tell You"" and the heartbreaking same-session outtake ""Right Track Now"", Erickson foregoes his usual hysterical vocals for a much more direct, reflective approach. But I Have Always Been Here is more interested in Erickson's less-explored post-Elevators period, roughly from the mid-70s to the present. Whether solo or with the Aliens, he churned out potent and patently weird Texas blues rock similar to Stevie Ray Vaughn or early ZZ Top and often mimicked the vocal hiccups of fellow Texan Buddy Holly. In the 1970s, Erickson became fascinated with science fiction, re-creating B-movies with songs like ""Creature With the Atom Brain"" and ""Stand for the Fire Demon"". What makes these songs so kick-ass is that it's the sound of someone going right off the page of the rock script-- like so many B-movie auteurs of the '60s (Ray Dennis Steckler and Hal Warren, ill-fated director of Manos: The Hands of Fate, come to mind), he's doing whatever he wants with no one to tell him that's not how it's done. As a result, very few of the songs on I Have Always Been Here Before depend for their impact on the listener's knowledge of Erickson's mental health at the time. This is perhaps the singer's true achievement, which this compilation generously spotlights: even when he was suffering, his strange music sounds wholly idiosyncratic and spiritually curious, the sound of a man who won't let the world's ugliness diminish his enjoyment of life or hinder his search for something solid and secure.",,9.1,

Moloko could do icy noir when they wanted but they could also be playful and mischievous with an interest in off-kilter pop. Their albums don't hold up all that well but they got better the further they went from their trip-hop roots and left a handful of good singles behind. ""Sing It Back"" from I Am Not a Doctor is one such gem, and beyond its catchy chorus it now has further significance since a remix brought Moloko singer Róisín Murphy together with Matthew Herbert. After the fortuitous meeting over the mixing board, Murphy and Herbert later decided to collaborate on this, her debut solo album. They wrote the songs together and Herbert handled the production, melding his intricate sampling technique, which proceeds according to strict compositional strictures, with contributions from other musicians, mostly horns and reeds. All songs were released piecemeal earlier this year on three low-profile 12"" EPs titled Sequins 1-3. It's hard to imagine anyone not ranking this is the best thing Murphy has ever done. Her singing has definitely improved in a technical sense, as she sounds more confident and controlled with her voice basically stripped of processing. She's also ironed out some of her trademark tics, mostly leaving behind the pinched nasal tone that seemed intended to impart ""attitude"" to certain Moloko tracks. And behind Murphy is some of Herbert's most balanced and functional music-- plenty of glitches and odd noises but always deployed in the service of the song. The first seven tracks are very nearly flawless. ""Leaving the City"" combines a repetitious pleading refrain by Murphy (""No more goodbyes!"") with tense backing from Herbert at his busiest, the out-of-tune guitar plucks imparting a palpable sense of urgency. ""Through Time"" is another highlight with its airy bossa nova feel, the subdued and spacious production complementing Murphy's voice at is rich and sultry peak. Throughout Herbert uses the horns primarily for quick percussive stabs and minute textural accents, magically evoking pop classicism with fussy micro-edited electronics. The towering opening run ends with the album's first single ""If We're in Love"", one of the 2005's best to date and a song that suggests that Murphy and Herbert could freelance as a hitmaking r&b songwriting duo if so inclined. ""Ramalama (Bang Bang)"" is almost as excellent but more unusual, sharing with ""The Night of the Dancing Flame"" a German cabaret feel, with dark jazz accents and Herbert molding gothic percussion into twisted gargoyle shapes. From there Ruby Blue takes a short excursion into a more experimental direction that isn't quite as satisfying. The title track has an awesome overdriven guitar tone and sharp cool vocal layering but it feels very underwritten compared to what has come before while ""Off On It"" a meandering assemblage of cool noises. ""Prelude to Love in the Making"" is a short snippet of a track called ""Love in the Making"" that appeared complete on Sequins 2, and we're not missing much in excerpted form. Ruby Blue ends with the gorgeous ballad ""Closing of the Doors"", played on the piano that was certainly used to help write the rest of the music and was supplanted throughout by Herbert's always fascinating synthesized stand-ins. It's a nice closer and a good reminder of what makes this record so good. When the songwriting is on, Ruby Blue seems perfect, the ultimate combination of human warmth and technological know-how. ","Former Moloko singer teams with Matthew Herbert for her gorgeous solo debut.

The Aether Eater,Odawas,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46213d197565213bf3f/1:1/w_160/4f761b8e.jpg,2005-07-07 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6118-the-aether-eater/,Jagjaguwar,"With multiple references to Dante and Virgil and lyrics that namecheck distant constellations, unnamed Sphinxes, Odessian forests, and Saturn's rings, it seems Odawas have selected Voyage and Return as their basic plot of choice. On their debut full-length The Aether Eater, the Indiana trio's music suffers from a similarly potent strain of wanderlust, as their loopy art-rock travels impulsively from cracked Heartland balladry to hyper-inflated space-age keyboard pomp at the blink of a faulty engine light. And though these cosmic tourists manage to locate some admittedly fantastic points of interest, their haphazard navigational powers might cause even the most stir-crazy listeners to wait for assistance from more reliable guides. Co-authored by the group's multi-instrumentalists Michael Tapscott and Isaac Edwards, The Aether Eater seems to be loosely constructed around the fabulous exploits of a waylaid astronaut who's had himself several adventures in the nether regions of the galaxy, whether at ""the back of Orion"" or ""the Tripton County Fair."" Interspersed with his tales are a handful of appropriately stardust-fuelled instrumental passages, as well as ""Benjamin"" and ""Kids"", a pair of brief childhood recollections that are unsettling in the way that only creepy childhood recollections can be. (""You've heard the stories told from kids in school/ About a boy who went walking in the woods and he died. Kids!"") Though at various junctures the album points in vaguely baroque or folkish directions, it is primarily built on space-rock tracks like ""The Golden Fog"" and ""The Unnamed Sphinx"", where Edwards' ambient keyboards swell and undulate with gravity-defying splendor, while Tapscott's reedy, Neil Youngish pipes provide an unsteady torchlight through the celestial fog. And before things become overly familiar, Odawas also frequently include brief, seemingly arbitrary interjections of harmonica, flute, and harpsichord-- appearances whose unpredictability allows the listener little time to skim these placid waves on autopilot. Strangest of all is ""Ant Man Messiah Elijah"", a trippy, partially spoken-word track that provides extensive exposition of the album's screwy narrative. ""I will set my course for the Pangean Bones that lie past the sun with the Nebulan Horse,"" intones Tapscott, in the type of heavily-effected (perhaps backwards-masked?) delivery that one might associate with a David Lynch dream sequence. That cleared up, the group are again free to continue forth, leading the listener through ""Behind the Moon"" and ""Song of Temptations"", two tranquil, rather uneventful instrumentals that utilize dreamy guitar textures, bagfuls of sci-fi sound effects, and even a courtly, Dark Side of the Moon saxophone solo. The album's journey ends logically enough with ""Virgil"", a track that serves as a tidy summary of last reminiscences (""Virgil was the best friend I'd had/ But he was a dream and I was a man"") and lessons learned (""To be saved you can have no sympathy/ And to be alive I must often grieve."") And though there are points on The Aether Eater at which you find yourself cautiously glancing around for the escape hatch, Odawas at least have the courtesy to deliver you unharmed back where you started, but good luck finding anyone to believe your stories of the experience.","On their debut full-length, the Jagjaguwar trio tackles and exhibits wanderlust.

Donkey Stock,Absentee,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c35e6ef95969320274/1:1/w_160/14582caf.jpg,2005-07-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/478-donkey-stock/,Memphis Industries,"Elegant debauchery is a tough thing to nail, and there are only a few bands who have managed to strike that perfect balance of class and crass and make music that transcends both. Tindersticks, for example, have been cranking out albums that freely migrate from posh lobbies to stained sheets, desire to addiction. On their debut EP, Absentee seem to be flirting with this same territory (right down to the donkey in the title), though not with quite the same success. Most of the music rests in this ambiguous place between country indie rock-- eighth notes on the bass caressed by steel guitar and Daniel Michaelson's molasses baritone. An occasional stab of distortion-soaked guitar breaks the record's focus on slow, brooding ballads. So to does the sole up-tempo track, ""Something to Bang"", which is stuffed with fuzzy leads and pounding drums offset by Michaelson's steadfastly low-key vocals, which join the song at more of a walking pace and scarcely rise above a tone of casual conversation. ""I'm tired of being a man/ Always something to bang,"" he says, but his discomfort with his own desire in the lyrics isn't fully fleshed out. Later, on ""In the Toilets Again"", he sings ""It doesn't help to know we're having sex without coming"" and it feels similarly, er, unfulfilled, as though the imagery of the song is hoping for the debased depths of the human spirit, but can't get past the ""doo doo doo doo"" backing vocals to find it. That the dirtiness in the lyrics feels frequently contrived is a major strike against the effectiveness of the record as a whole. Otherwise, things work nicely, as the band has a good sense of dynamics, and Michaelson's voice inhabits their countrified textures with heavy world-weariness. So all the pieces aren't yet fitting together as they should, but Absentee are still a winning proposition on the whole. This is just a debut EP, 26 minutes long, and one gets the impression that this is a band that will sound more at home in the longer format of an album, where ideas can be drawn out and mistakes are more easily overlooked.","Memphis Industries band balances crass and class á la the Tindersticks.

Yes, it's true that Collapsar, Oxes, and Fucking Champs are all three-piece, instrumental, math rock-influenced metal bands. Yes, it is also true that none of them have a bass player. And yes, all three bands are known for their over-the-top, ass-rocking live performances. But that is where the similarities end, my friend. Oh, wait, they kind of sound alike, too. But seriously, let's not sell Collapsar short. Their debut, self-titled album is a mammoth fusion of metal, prog-rock, jazz, and math rock. The three members of Collapsar (guitarists Stephen Sheppert and Dave Graeff and drummer Brett Judice) are capable of creating constantly shifting rhythms and nimble-fingered guitar noodling. The lack of a bassist is barely noticeable, as one guitar is almost constantly holding down the low end with heavy, crushing riffs while the other explores the higher end of the neck. So sure, there are similarities, but it's a point that's easily forgotten once the stereo is cranked. The album opens with ""Death's Other Dominion"", a track that highlights the band's jazz leanings. It also features a combination-- jerky, arrhythmic beat, progged-out guitar wankery, low-end crunch, and a pinch of melodic chord phrasing-- that most of the tracks follow at the risk of seeming repetitive. The band's name comes from another word for a black hole, and ""Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla"" introduces the band's sci-fi element. Several tracks feature sci-fi and fantasy themed titles (""Pray to Thor"", ""Sleep Robot"", ""Robot Wins""), and the use of various guitar effects in the swirling, echoing breakdowns throughout the disc helps to tie it all together. ""King Kong Died for your Sins"" adds computer blips (actually, it's still guitar, but you'll swear differently on first listen) as it transitions from some of the heaviest and most intense riffing found on the disc to the most melodic and gentle. The appropriately titled ""Opus 1"" finds the band in full-on prog mode. The track clocks in at nine-and-a-half minutes, and there are frankly too many musical shifts to describe. The track acts as a virtual sampler platter for the entire disc and features some of its most aggressive drumming and impressive guitar work. The length and shifts prove to be a bit too much, however, as when the band gets too herky-jerky, it's hard to really get caught up in the moment. Not that I'm actually trying to headbang along, but, you know, you just can't headbang to some of this stuff.","Latest from the three-piece, instrumental, math rock-influenced metal band.

Wolf Parade EP,Wolf Parade,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaabc0084474cd0c121e/1:1/w_160/d0866c63.jpg,2005-07-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8793-wolf-parade-ep/,Sub Pop,"It's difficult reviewing crumbs when you've already gorged yourself on the main course, but peering into the future offers the benefit of hindsight, which allows me to say now with some degree of confidence that Wolf Parade should have a pretty sick autumn. I'm not just tossing around bold claims: The Montreal-via-Victoria quartet has already received celebratory write-ups in both The New York Times and Time's Canadian edition, been featured on The Believer's highly touted music-issue compilation (covering an unreleased Frog Eyes song), and taken to the stage at NYC's Piano's to celebrate that disc's release. The youngsters even played 2004's All Tomorrow's Parties in a showcase curated by their biggest influence, Modest Mouse, and worked closely with Isaac Brock-- he produced two tracks on this EP and turned knobs for much of their full-length debut, Apologies to the Queen Mary, which will be released in late September by Sub Pop. There's more. Guitarist/vocalist Dan Boeckner and drummer Arlen Thompson have played with the Arcade Fire (those are Arlen's drums you're hearing on Funeral's ""Wake Up""), and Arlen is also in a two-piece with ex-Hot Hot Heat guitarist Dante Decaro. My favorite vocalist in the crew, keyboardist Spencer Krug, has played and recorded with Frog Eyes, toured as a pianist with Destroyer, and records solo material as the skeletal, lo-fi, and often stunning Sunset Rubdown. (Check his take on one of Wolf Parade's best songs, ""I'll Believe in Anything"".) So the question, then, is how to take Wolf Parade's music purely on its own terms, without the excess baggage of peripheral relations, anticipation, and perceived hype. Well, let's start with what it sounds like. Some will proclaim that Wolf Parade don't diverge too greatly-- if at all-- from the standard-issue indie rock template, and they won't necessarily be wrong about that. Thing is, all old/new/left/right sounds are out there for anyone to pillage, but for a band to pillage with enough acuity or verve to make the stuff sound so much their own is a rarity. Like Spencer, Dan, or Arlen's friends the Arcade Fire, Wolf Parade remold familiarity into especially effective anthems, ballads, and dance-floor crashers. But unlike many of their peers, they transition between spastic pop and gloriously pretty Bowie theatricality without showing seams. Here, layered hooks and caffeinated-savant melodies are recollected in tranquility. Opener ""Shine a Light""-- not to be mistaken for the Constantines track of the same name-- is an equatorial, upbeat blender of various vocal lines, wool-blanket laser-tag keyboards, and a cinched drum-and-guitar groove, until it eventually heaves and collapses into a keyboard pile-up finale. ""You Are a Runner and I Am My Father's Son"" (included here, but also slated as the opening track of the forthcoming album) is Modest Mouse dancing a fuzzed minuet with Rain Dogs and The Lonesome Crowded West's long-lost Orange Julius. Unfortunately, the two non-LP B-sides aren't as hot: ""Disco Sheets"" boils down to post-punk Bowie (sans mountains' majesty), while ""Lousy Pictures"" is a mid-tempo circus ode (with a tricky Pet Sounds sleigh bell break) riffing on hanging in trees and throwing rocks at the sky. Certainly, Sub Pop could've included any number of better tracks from the full-length, but then, it's not too difficult to see why they might not want to show all their cards at once. As bloggers illustrate daily, hype now comes pre-packaged with backlash. Kneejerks start sighing as soon as nice things start getting said, which for Wolf Parade might have been right around the time that the CBC Radio 3 sessions-- their first recordings to show palpable promise-- found their way onto the web last November. But it's also worth noting that this band shouldn't be judged by this EP alone. As a promotional tool seemingly designed to simply keep their momentum afloat, it's half castoffs and doesn't do justice to the way their infectious poetics unfold across Apologies to the Queen Mary, where bar-room sing-alongs break into hymns for hungry ghosts and summer anthems are somehow born cliche-free. Still, for the curious, the two LP tracks should whet appetites for what's to come-- and judging the music purely on its own merits, that stands to be some fairly rewarding stuff.","A forerunner of the great ""Wolf"" bandnaming craze of 2005, these pals of the Arcade Fire have built a rep on live shows and demos. Now Sub Pop issues this EP-- two songs of which were produced by Isaac Brock-- in anticipation of their debut album.

Give Me All Your Money,Doris Henson,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb7ea9e61561daa72dc/1:1/w_160/dbd043c5.jpg,2005-07-06 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2616-give-me-all-your-money/,DeSoto,"Doris Henson are a band out of time. Had they appeared in the mid-1980s, their cheeky hard-rock riffs, campy group harmonies, and trombone accompaniment could have fit alongside those smirking early alternative acts that only get remembered for joke hits: Violent Femmes, They Might Be Giants, Camper Van Beethoven, etc. Had it been the mid-90s, their hard-driving melodies that keep the influence of Nirvana while showing humor and restraint. Today, their velvet-gloved take on modern rock might be an odd fit, but they've made a cohesive record that has a few memorable moments. Give Me All Your Money is the group's second record (their first for DeSoto Records). The songs tread the line between light-hearted and detached, which at the very least lends them a unique personality. If their campy, defanged delivery is too much for you, and you like your rock sweaty and sincere, there's still more than a couple songs with wider appeal. ""A Dark Time for the Light Side of the Earth"" stretches its sludgy tempo into a success with interlocking guitars and a catchy vocal melody, while the perky ""Day Is Done"" is the perfect mix of a minimal guitar melody, trombone, and group harmonies. ""Sidestepping"" lays the album's most earnest vocal performance over a simple chord progression and build-and-fall dynamics, breathing new life into old gimmicks. Then there's that trombone. They don't make a lot of noise about having one, just subtly slide it into the songs without announcement. However, they're not using it the way they use guitar, bass, and drums, as a primary instrument. Sometimes it works, and folds in seamlessly as another burst of melody as in ""Day is done"", and sometimes it gives me third-wave ska flashbacks, as when it's forced into the bridge of ""Joybirds"". Even if they make it fit, does this band need a full-time trombone player for the occasional blurt of a horn? (Maybe on stage, he dances in a plaid suit when he's not playing.) Songs like ""Let You Down"" let their cuteness (""You'll never see me naked, I'll never let you down"") overcome it's boisterous riffing. That's a shame, since Give Me All Your Money is for the most part a subdued album, one that could use more spirited performances like ""Day Is Done"". The tricky thing exemplified by ""Let You Down"" is that Doris Henson are capable players and songwriters, but that artistic detachment feels like a disappointing ""comment"" on guitar-rock . I love the fact Doris Henson have a sense of humor, but the flip between the smirk and the earnestness is awkward-- and tracks like ""Sidestepping"" or the dreamy closer ""When You Go"" just shine so much brighter to my ears.","The songs on this Kansas-based group's second LP (and first for DeSoto) treads the line between light-hearted and detached.

Blumm's third album, I was seeking revenge. Not on Frank Schültge Blumm, but on all the virtuosos I've encountered since fourth grade band class, when the girl down the street outplayed me in ""When the Saints Come Marching In"", reducing me to tears. You see, these virtuosos impeccably run up and down their scales, nailing their chords and key changes without any love for the music itself-- only its technicality. So here I go, ready to launch into my anti-Blumm harangue and release 12-plus years of embitterment when...aw shucks, Blumm done tugged on my heartstrings, again. True, I should've seen this coming. 2002's Ankern wooed and coddled listeners with delicate melodies and gorgeous arrays of guitar, strings, piano, and nearly any other instrument he could get his hands on. As indie's answer to Yanni, Blumm left reviewers muttering sweet nothings like ""atmospheric"" or ""uplifting."" However, sheer prettiness couldn't hide that Ankern was often downright boring. On Zweite Meer, we find Blumm poking his musical ideas with a stick, wakening marginal progress. Blumm's one-word track titles set the table for his equally sparse songs. Opener ""Sonn"" makes great background music, but sounds like a misplaced cog from a Sufjan Stevens arrangement or, say, something by Mouse on Mars, to whom Blumm has contributed the occasional horn or classical guitar part. The rest of the album comes across like a fusion of nearly every genre imaginable: Although the album's deeply rooted in folk and classical music, flecks of pop, shoegazer, lo-fi, and jazz pepper the otherwise homogenous mix. Unfortunately, the pulsing bass of ""Wass"" or clean-toned guitar improvising on ""Wamdel"" make mere divots on Blumm's otherwise flat, fallow landscape. Before I completely scorch Blumm's songwriting chops, I will say this-- the man makes some damn charming music. Having a beef with innocuous music is hard, and I wouldn't mind hearing this album in every elevator I ever enter for the rest of my life. Zweite Meer's a veritable soundtrack for our lives, or rather the quotidian grocery shopping/mowing the lawn portion of them. It's probably playing in your room right now, you just don't notice it.","Second Morr LP from the virtuoso multi-instrumentalist.

A Good Ground,Oxford Collapse,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45f5e6ef95969323a43/1:1/w_160/02d533a2.jpg,2005-07-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6116-a-good-ground/,Kanine,"Oxford Collapse play rock rife with paradox. Their music makes you want to punch someone, then grab and hug him. It sounds piped straight from bygone airwaves, yet feels new, potent, and very much undeveloped. Most perplexingly, A Good Ground-- the Brooklyn trio's new full-length, which retreads a lot of the good ground covered on 2004's Some Wilderness-- is inconsistent in a strange way: The Collapse trade off between songs in their exciting, fully-formed voice, and happily inconsequential rock by rote. The band often seem shy of their own talents, content to hammer a sloppy backbeat under familiar-sounding changes. When this formulaic approach is buttressed by a hook-- which happens excitingly often-- the OC are unstoppable, burning up imaginary stages, dominating 80s underground rock retrospectives, and owning the charts 23 years ago. Of the two bands present on A Good Ground, I prefer the one responsible for ""Proofreading"". The guitar has a kinetic, galloping quality not seen since Replacements and Feelies walked the Earth. But while the OC mine the barren lands of Hoboken for archaeological evidence of their ancient heroes, the band have some new millennial fight in them. ""Prop Cars"" is loud, choppy, and desultory in a manner more closely identified with tough dude hardcore than cardigan-clad indie rock. All it misses is the outta-my-way clarity of a lead melodic line. That's something ""Last American Virgin"" brings, albeit in bass notes. Adam Rizer delivers warm, overanxious basslines that barely appear in the mix, like soap submerged in bathtub water. His line on ""LAV"" is one of this album's best, but what I love most about the song (besides the cowbell) is the ending: Who writes a killer bridge, rife with transitional possibilities, and plays it for eight too-quick measures before pulling the plug? It's such a novice move, it shows enormous maturity. As for the other band, they're for the most part smothered. Opener ""Empty Fields"" means well and is quick enough (1:12) but, sans melodic or structural development, ultimately pointless. A better song to pop the cork with would have been the epic, faded-in ""Last American Virgin"" or the wordless ""Cracks in the Causeway"", whose gentle ""ba di bop di""s offer a charming how-do-you-do. The only other dud is ""No Great Shakes"", which sounds like an early B-side: muzzled, self-conscious and disappointingly simplistic for a group of rhythmic contortionists. See the lithe, pensive ""The Boys Go Home"" for an antidote. A Good Ground is made for trebly car speakers on late-night drives down empty, lamp-lit parkways. Or not. Ideal listening contexts are, of course, always subjective, but Oxford Collapse are worth the time it takes to discover one. Folks will kvetch about the washy recording sound and Mike Pace's yelped (and sometimes even yodeled) vocals-- tasteful affects at the heart of the band's sound. But there's something refreshing about a band as stubborn as Oxford Collapse: sure to be hated on for a handful of abrasive, outmoded stylistic choices, they remain adamant and unswerving. That devotion shines through on this mostly wonderful record.","Brooklyn trio trade off between songs in an exciting, fully-formed voice and rock by rote.

RWD Magazine Mixtape Vol. 1,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84cc0084474cd0c0dcc/1:1/w_160/9111fbf9.gif,2005-07-06 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2090-rwd-magazine-mixtape-vol-1/,RWD,"Logan Sama grabs the mic at the beginning of this mix to tell us that he's ""the best I am at what I do."" He tells us several more times throughout. What he does is DJ grime on venerable London pirate radio station Rinse FM. So why is dude so full of hubris? Well, a lot of people credit him with bringing the vocal anthem back to the scene after a long stretch of instrumental singles designed for MCs to spit over live. And he's been one of the DJs pushing the r&g; (that's rhythm & grime) sound (about which more later) that many others credit with pulling the scene back from near total darkness and, well, grime. Oh, and he's managed to beg, borrow, or steal more than three dozen anthems, exclusives, and freestyles to put together what amounts to, as he sez, the best grime mixtape ever. So I think he's earned his talkover intrusions. (My only request, if he ever reads this, is that he get his own version of the DJ Clue/Kayslay/et al explosion FX, preferably a giant bell sound, á la Big Ben.) With 40 tracks in 80 minutes, Sama doesn't waste much time lingering over pretty melodies, extended beat sections, or even second verses in most cases. Like a Jamaican selector or the friend you haven't seen for a while with a clutch of new music to play you, he's slamming from one cool part of a track to the next and fuck letting it play until it gets boring. (Derrick May and Larry Levan would not be pleased.) The result, at least for the first half, seems to ratchet up the intensity with each new track. There's Kano's ""P's & Q's"", a track that doesn't feel like an anthem the first 300 times, but then he says ""slippin"" in that lazy menace way of his for the 301st and you can almost hear it. The Mitchell Brothers' ""Routine Check"" is ""99 Problems"" relocated to Hobbiton with another slurry-of-porridge-out-of-the-corner-of-his-mouth cameo from Mike Skinner. (Sounding more than ever out of step with ""proper grime"" and better for it.) Track of the mix, if I was forced to choose with the bamboo shoots at the ready, is Dogzilla's ""Hallo"". Produced by Danny Weed, it's got the big, fuck-off stadium drums we've come to expect (Bonham on a lean) and some pretty vicious guitar stabs and of course I am going to be sympathetic to any song which contains the command ""kiss my fat, white arse."" Jammer proves he's not just looking like Lil Jon these days with the shouty ""Merkle Man"", followed by even more Danny Weed bathysphere booms on Roll Deep's ""When I'm 'Ere"", this time with extra accordion. I still have my reservations about the middle r&g; section however. While I appreciate that it's getting the ladies back in the clubs, something still feels cheap about putting r&b; vocals over a grime instrumental and calling it a new genre. It's produced a handful of amazing tunes, but sometimes it just sounds like 2-step with some new noises or (worse) British r&b.; Now I'm getting my xenophobia and my masculine bias on, but if grime is the British reponse to rap, then they got a ways to go before they work up a comparable response for soul. (Okay, okay, fine. I am being too harsh. In six months I probably won't even feel the same way. I hated Kano's ""What Have You Done?"" and now I think it's a masterpiece. Caveat emptor.) But then, wooo! He rallies with an extended outro of bangers, like the amazing throwback UKG of SLK's ""Hype! Hype!"" featuring maybe the most exuberant vocals any grime MC has yet spit. (Sticky productions always have great vocals...come home, Lady Stush!) Grime is great! So here's my request for the rest of the summer. No more articles about whether it's going to break the U.S. rap market (it hasn't even really broken the UK), no more whining it hasn't broken out from the hipster ghetto in the U.S., no more sociological treatise or attempts at your thesis. Enjoy the records as is. I don't care how you do it. Pretend they are transmission from Pluto. Or Sublime Frequencies is putting them out.

The Cookbook,Missy Elliott,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc53eb335119a49ecc37/1:1/w_160/b8231ed5.jpg,2005-07-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2759-the-cookbook/,AtlanticGoldmind,"For all of the unswerving worship heaped at the altar of Timbaland, his last collaboration with Missy Elliott, 2003's strange-for-the-sake This Is Not a Test!, was the sound of a once-great tag-team rehashing their own tricks with diminishing returns. Yet, for such a tight-knit pair, it's long been a question how she might fare without his input. On The Cookbook, we're given our answer. Here, Timbaland has gone largely absent, and while it's refreshing to hear Elliott-- easily one of the most innovative and engaging artists to have graced hip-hop's microphone-- again imbued with purpose and something to prove, the duo's impossibly high standards and no-rules originality are sorely missed on some of the record's sleepier, more conventional tracks. Like an untethered spouse suddenly separated from a longtime love, Elliott seems a bit lost somewhere between her intimidating past and her newfound independence. Even more bipolar than usual, The Cookbook finds the rapper/singer jolting from uber-hypeness to soul-crushing balladry. Fortunately, supported by an array of producers both grizzly and green, her invaluable unpredictability is alternately harnessed and given new life on this album, despite its uneven and transitional nature. Elliott eases into the transition, opening the album with Timbaland's only two productions. After a remarkably unnecessary intro track featuring guest vocals from Mike Jones, the platinum club's least charismatic new star, Timbo slides in with ""Joy"", a wispy thump that would sound a lot more radical and stealthy if the Ying Yang Twins had never learned to speak softly about big sticks. Jones returns at the end of the track to (you guessed it) say his name repeatedly and spout off his cell number, quickly turning a once-clever self-promotion routine into a particularly shameless home-shopping network ploy. This is followed by the generic ""Partytime"", which finds Elliott sticking it to defenseless has-beens like Coolio and Sisqo (was Kris Kross too obvious?). Of course, never one to kill in a lyrical showdown, Elliott compensates for such limitations with a gum-chewing sass that's virtually unparalleled. A vocal chameleon, she's the rare artist who can score as both a sultry r&b; crooner and a hot-shit rhyme slapper. Showing off the latter persona, Elliott crushes on the Rich Harrison burner ""Can't Stop"". His tribal drums and blast-off horns should sound exhausted after ""Crazy in Love"" and ""1 Thing"", but they still manage to provide Missy with a spectacular foundation on which she unleashes a flurry of typically blunt sex raps. Likewise, destructive sub-bass and cartoonish bendy-metal boosts help to make ""On & On"" the Neptunes' most inventive track since ""Drop It Like Its Hot"", on which Pharrell pulls off a strikingly authentic Slick Rick impression. This, however, is after the real Rick puts in a cameo on the half-rap, half-r&b; throwback ""Irresistible Delicious"". Continuing Under Construction's old-school archival tendencies, ""Irresistible"" doesn't just feature the legendary eye-patched tale-twister; it also heavily samples his awesome ""Lick the Balls"". It's further proof that, despite her insistence that her ""style can't be duplicated or recycled,"" Elliott isn't afraid to rehash others' material-- including the timeless ""Apache"" on ""We Run This"", and Mary J. Blige's ""What's the 411?"" beat on ""My Struggles"". In fact, she often flirts with both reverence and unoriginality to a disconcerting degree. ""Irresistible"" ducks such criticism with its beautifully lush, if oddly tacked-on chorus, which offers the album's most appetizing singing-Missy moment, but other slow-jams fail miserably: The Scott Storch-produced ""Meltdown"" makes Carrie Underwood's drippy ""Inside Your Heaven"" sound like a genre-defining new classic, while American Idol Fantasia Barrino just sounds like a sober Macy Gray on ""4 My Man"". Finisher ""Bad Man"" enticingly sees Elliott looking to the future of body-bending beats with an electro-palpitating bounce that wouldn't sound out of place on Arular. Fittingly, M.I.A. and Vybz Cartel drop by for guest shots, and Maya's hungry sneer pushes Missy to new ragga-tinged heights. The song makes a convincing case for Elliott to take another stab at creating a back-to-front Timboless record more suitable to her near-peerless pedigree.","After This Is Not a Test!-- which saw Elliott and Timbaland rehash their own ticks with diminishing returns-- the rapper-singer is here supported by an array of producers and her invaluable unpredictability is alternately harnessed and given new life on this transitional LP.

The View From the Floor,Slow Dazzle,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6aeea9e61561daa5404/1:1/w_160/9e726cf0.jpg,2005-07-05 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7815-the-view-from-the-floor/,Misra,"Rockcrit's 1990s reappraisal of (some) country music remains largely unresolved. Ryan Adams has long since exposed himself as merely a gifted mockingbird; Wilco assimilated Brian Wilson sunshine and Radiohead abstraction only to give your stepdad, with their latest, something hep to hawk on Half.com. Whither, then, the weary, Dust Bowl clarity of so-called alt-country? Could modern Americana, already deeply imitative, evolve without imitating yet something else? Finally, crucially: Was a carefully distilled approximation of earnestness really all that made ""Houses on the Hill"" better than ""You're Still the One""? Guess what: Slow Dazzle-- named for a John Cale album, but better known as two-thirds of second-tier indie-pop group Mendoza Line-- don't provide any definitive answers. Still, at least they're throwing out a few hints. Core duo Shannon McArdle and Timothy Bracy like their rustic vocals and saloon songwriting ensconced in dreamy electronics and ProTools psychedelia, courtesy of third member and producer Peter Langland-Hassan: backwards guitars, dirge-like drum machines, atmospheric synths. The Mekons' Sally Timms has charted a similar course in her solo work. In a word, it's art-country, and the underlying urban/rural dichotomy neatly befits Slow Dazzle's Brooklyn-via-Georgia roots. Over a sparse eight songs, The View From the Floor continues the male/female point-counterpoint of recent Mendoza Line records. McArdle's wavering twang opens the disc on the lush, elliptical ""Fleur de Lis"", the album's least country moment. McCardle's ""Wedding Dance"" is the strongest original song here, a typically desperate Appalachian ballad dressed up with hints of piano and cavernous synth strings. Bracy-penned ""The Extent of My Remarks"" lets her wax goofily morbid-- pushing lovers down stairs, running off with women, suiciding-- but though her vocals call to mind a less-tuneful Neko Case, the depravity never really goes anywhere. Bracy, for his part, struggles to affect the grizzled, off-key knowingness of Bob Dylan or a folksier Lou Reed. He alludes to Coen Brothers films and unjudiciously employs extended judicial metaphors. ""There's nothing more ridiculous than a man chasing his hat,"" he wheezes, ""except perhaps a man chasing a girl like you."" All of which brings us to that final question: What, other than aging newspapermen's personal biases (now too easily derided as ""rockism"") made certain alt-country more affecting than most mainstream country-pop? I submit, exactly what literary critic Martin Amis has tirelessly championed in his own chosen purview: talent. You can become rich without talent, famous without talent, but you can't become talented without talent, Amis writes. So we do away with talent: The author of Hannibal is hailed as Pulitzer-worthy; the likes of Shania receive unironic accolades (patience, Brooks & Dunn). Alas, it is in this nebulous quality-- talent-- that Slow Dazzle's efforts here ultimately prove deficient. A halting, unexceptional Leonard Cohen cover stands leagues above anything else on the disc. There's no shame in a well-executed cover, but Slow Dazzle's ""Anthem"" is no match for Johnny Cash's ""Bird on a Wire"", the suddenly unfashionable Jeff Buckley's ""Hallelujah"", or-- if we may expand beyond Cohen-- Uncle Tupelo's ""No Depression"".","Two members of second-tier indie poppers the Mendoza Line go art-country.

Git,Skeletons and the Girl-Faced Boys,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6619d034d5c69bf350c/1:1/w_160/0fbe3331.jpg,2005-07-05 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7747-git/,Ghostly,"An informal poll in the Pitchfork break room found Skeletons' Matt Mehlan compared to Jamiroquai and Arthur Russell. Weird, right? I respect the assessments, actually, but lean toward Russell's fragility, especially as heard on World of Echo. Mehlan does foster a sunny vibe you could consider kinda Jay Kay on delivery alone, but a closer approximation is Russell's semi-falsetto and the fractured instrumentation graphed to the Sea & Cake's Sam Prekop. Skeletons began as the solo project of Shinkoyo Records co-founder Mehlan. His last record, I'm at the Top of the World, received praise here at Pitchfork, and before that he released Everybody Dance With Your Steering Wheel in 2002 and Life and the Afterbirth in 2003. Mehlan's still the skipper on Git, but after playing live shows with a backup band, he's opted to lay down a recording with collaborators tagged ""The Girl-Faced Boys."" They're now a multi-instrumental five-piece in which everyone sings, plays percussion, and contributes a share of the guitar, bass, and laptop clicks. Despite the time spent unpacking timbre, Mehlan's voice is just one component of Skeletons' assorted post-rock, world-beat electro-acoustics: Imagine aforementioned warblers backed by Liquid Liquid, Talking Heads, and perky IDM. Still, the way he croons on a given track is often its make-or-break. At times, he is too Jamiroquai. In fact, the best moments arrive when he lets music drift away from language, as on ""Do You Feel Any Better?,"" which drops vocals after a couple minutes, allowing electro clicks and curves complete with rain forest sounds to lift-off. Belying its goofy name, ""There's a Fly In Your Soup and I Put It There"" is a ghostly chorus of bleats and sighs over digital tweaks and twitters, and the opening patch of ""Y'all Thinks It's Soo Easy""-- a tag of percussion woven with a clipped loop and muffled Mariachi-- could be expanded into the best !!! ever. There are instances where the vocal/instrumental paring goes well, such as on ""While We Were at the Movies"", a piano/laptop-fronted piece that evaporates amid a libretto of removal: ""Take away the locks on your door/ Take away your aspirin/ Take away your knives/ Take away of your alcohol, etc."" It makes sense to stop the song mid-beat, as it too is removed with all this other domestic detritus. I know Mehlan's at times singing about mild darknesses, but Git always sounds pristine, as if songs were vacuum-packed in post-production. Because of this, even when the lyrics deal with scratching mosquito bites until nails come off or showing scars or when Mehlan sings ""We won't be proud/ We'll just think you're an idiot"", I kept thinking ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"". Likewise, there's talk of the experimental ""out"" sounds of the instrumentation, but despite his liberal use of bells and whistles (and junkyard percussion), even mainstream hip-hop offers more oddly shuffling (and often more compelling) accompaniment. But just because this isn't as innovative or feverish as some would have you believe doesn't mean Git lacks value. The songs are pretty and I imagine these guys will have success, but much of the time it sounds like it was recorded in an operating room. Dr. Mehlan and company really outta scuff-up the sterility.","Matt Mehlan is part Jay Kay and part Arthur Russell on this Ghostly International release.

Rumblings,Smegma,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ab13d197565213922f/1:1/w_160/a586be7a.jpeg,2005-07-05 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7813-rumblings/,Hanson,"Noise fans might recognize Smegma from a collaborative album with Wolf Eyes called Beast. But if Smegma can be considered part of that scene, it's only by default: they've been making their psychedelic free-jazz noise for more than 25 years. They began by helping to found the Los Angeles Free Music Society, and have collaborated with everyone from Wild Man Fischer to Merzbow to the infamous rock critic Richard Meltzer along the way. The noise scene has grown unto them while they've kept a low profile and persistently crafted their avant-garde improvisations under the radar, firmly outside of the mainstream due to their confrontational sonics and formless compositions. (And, just maybe, the fact they named their band after uncircumcised dick leak.) My first exposure to Smegma was from somewhere less expected: The Completed Soundtrack for The Tropic of Nipples, in which Meltzer and Robert Pollard filled opposing tracks with faux-beat poetry over free-jazz and punk rock backing bands, respectively, each competing for the best non-sequitur. (One of my favorites: ""There's no need for senseless bloodshed/ The mosquitoes dropped their javelins and looked on/ Oh man, far out, it's king frog"") Smegma provided the soundtrack to Meltzer's contributions, and he's since become their singer under the alias ""Borneo Jimmy"". Just because there are vocals doesn't make Semgma's music any more accessible. Meltzer's voice is another disorienting texture, another oblong puzzle piece where we need a corner. Whispering different euphemisms for the homeless-- and hamburgers-- has never been creepier than on the scraping and squealing of ""Bunstuffer"", and the morale of the story told in ""Worms"" will make sense to only the most devoted alleyway wino. If there are themes present in Meltzer's rambling streetcorner fables, they're still not a hook to hold onto, so don't think Smegma less challenging for having a ""vocalist""; if anything, they're more so. Despite the names mentioned above, Rumblings is not an album of trance-inducing sine waves or face-stabbing feedback; Smegma create a unique cacophony from tape loops, blurting horns, pots and pans, sheet metal, radio static, duck calls, and Meltzer's ramblings. Thinking about Rumblings in terms of free jazz is more useful than contemporary noise analogues, but there's still potential to be hypnotized by the sounds on Rumblings. Tracks like ""Rails (Unhinged)"" blend the faraway sound of typewriters and office equipment, along with what sounds like an unmanned grocery cart rolling down an asphalt incline, into a calming and evocative soundscape. ""In an Ornamental Garden"" mixes the squealing saxophone that dominates Rumblings with traditional Eastern flutes and strings, and even harsher songs like ""Electron"" or ""Fool For You..."" give quirky interruptions to their droning, belying a sense of humor under the claustrophobic choas. The really strange parts are when they actually try to play their instruments and veer into trashy, incompetent punk. Just when I think they're clever confrantationalists, they go and rationalize the argument that avant-garde musicians ""just can't really play""-- songs like ""Moonleggs"", ""Worms"", and ""Rumblings"" sound like a completely different band, a group of wanna-be rockabilly misfits making up songs in the garage. Smegma aren't just avant-garde, they're committed to staying amateurishly campy, balancing their cacophonies with earnest attempts at open-mic-night punk. Whatever you want to call it-- ""noise"" doesn't quite cut it-- they're consistent about it, and they're unwaveringly dedicated to confounding audiences with their outsider rock.","Psychedelic free-jazz noise from the veteran band.

Hex Enduction Hour,The Fall,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4013d197565213b4db/1:1/w_160/63e6eb0c.jpg,2005-07-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2979-hex-enduction-hour/,KameraKamera,"How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Fall starts and ends with Hex Enduction Hour. It sure as hell doesn't start with the 458489 B-sides collection, like I once thought. ""Hey, it's cheap, and it has lots of songs, and it's two discs!"" = bad move. If you're new to the scene, and you want to know what the big deal is about this Fall group, proceed to Hex Enduction Hour post haste. But don't just take the word of some bitter no-talent sweater-wearing Pitchfork Media jerk. Renowned musicologist Courtney Love swears by the album's ramshackle opulence and vituperative charm. Even street thugs like Hex Enduction Hour! Why, one went so far as to play catch with my driver's side backseat window using a piece of concrete, just to get a hold of a copy. Castle has kindly reissued the album, and added a bonus disc. The recent Peel Sessions collection makes the inclusion of two session tracks somewhat superfluous, but that valuation assumes you're fanatical enough that the decision to drop upwards of $50 for a 6xCD set of radio sessions is no biggie. If you're not so disposed, enjoy this interpretation of ""Deer Park"" (the third on this collection) and a rinky-dinked ""Who Makes The Nazis?"" that replaces the introductory ping-ponging bass line with some banjo-sounding plunking. In addition, there's a B-side-- ""I'm Into C.B."", which sounds like a Fall B-side-- and some live tracks. Most notable from the live stuff is the inappropriately titled ""Jazzed Up Punk Shit"", unless their idea of jazz came from traveling into the future to watch This Is Spinal Tap. It's more like down-tempo Fall shit, the band puttering along on E (the fuel gague reading, not the recreational aid) as Mark E. mulches ""shit"" into ""shirt."" All of this is good, by the way. No write-up concerning the Fall is complete without mentioning and/or quoting their gone-but-not-forgotten patron saint John Peel, so here you go: ""Always different, always the same."" And that's Hex in a nutshell. You've got two-drummer, four-on-the-floor rave-ups like ""The Classical"", you've got pensive seethers like ""Hip Priest"", and you have a kazoo on ""Nazis?""-- all different, but all the same. It's Mark E. Smith's scatological charisma that makes, breaks, and remakes the Fall. As has been said before and will be said many times, the Fall are pre-, post-, and beyond punk, taking the same old tools and building timeless machines. Atavistic in approach, futuristic in scope. And catchy as all hell, too-- phrases like ""hey there, fuckface"" and ""he is not appreciated"" are hard to escape, either while listening to this record or doing anything else. The most quotable tidbits, however, are the ones that can't be neatly discerned through Smith's interpretive elocution. In regards to a pseudo-intellectual magazine editor: ""Has a beard which was weird/ Some time ago heard Ramones in '81/ Has a Spanish guitar."" In regards to who makes the Nazis: ""Motels like three split-level mirages...Buffalo lips on toast, smiling."" But what does it sound like, you may ask? Well, it sounds like the Fall. It sounds like a group of five talented musicians trying to play as brilliantly stupid as possible, while a sixth fellow from the docks hops on stage, grabs the mike, and fights his way through the morass scorched-earth style. It sounds like the primordial ooze that birthed touchstones like the Stooges and the Velvet Underground come to life, nursing a bitch of a hangover and a vendetta. It's something you're born with, not something you learn. And, as on most Fall records, but especially this one, it's something to behold.","2xCD reissue of the crucial 1982 LP adds live tracks, Peel sessions, and a B-side.

TP3 Reloaded,R. Kelly,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc48c0084474cd0c2a60/1:1/w_160/57f68d17.jpg,2005-07-05 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4597-tp3-reloaded/,Jive,"Is R. Kelly a joke or a genius? Does he really expect us to forget his recent... unpleasantness, or does he just not care what we think? Given the charges against him, how is he still recruiting A-list guest stars? How many metaphors for sex can one man think up? What the fuck is up with that album cover? Is the Matrix-quoting ""Reloaded"" an even more dated album title reference than TP2.com? R. Kelly is surrounded by more question marks than the Riddler, and I won't lie: All the baggage, mysteries, and moral quandaries make for a thick slice on the pie chart of R. Kelly enjoyment. The difficult part, then, is clearing away all that brush to get to the music, which is one reason he's the current king of r&b;: For all the absurdity of his ""Trapped in the Closet"" cycle and his endless stock of creative horniness, the man is an absolute master of his medium. TP3 Reloaded is one of those albums where every song sounds like a radio single, and since I live in Chicago, I'll likely be able to cross each one off the list by the end of the summer. Kelly cruises through genres like he's giving a guided tour, hitting crunk, dancehall, hip-hop, reggaeton, and naturally, a handful of bedroom ballads along the way. Production work is minimal, guest stars pay deference to their album host, and the entire album puts Kelly, his malleable voice, and his considerable persona center stage. Though R. Kelly's last outing was a departure, a two-disc concept album dealing with largely PG-rated topics like Jesus and steppin', Reloaded finds him back lecturing on his favorite topic: fucking. Fucking in the kitchen, fucking on the third date, fucking in R. Kelly's XXL white tee. Comparing fucking to remote control use, arson, and the chronic. Of course, Kelly's not quite so crass (he even self-beeps the f-word in the fifth ""chapter"" of ""Trapped in the Closet""), but the junior-high sex synonyms don't dilute the XXX; they merely keep it just barely radio-friendly. With such an unrelenting theme, *TP3 Reloaded's 75 minutes might test the patience of those not simultaneously engaging in the activities described-- and even those who are will likely find a few weak spots. Fortunately, there's enough gold buried in * TP3 worth digging for: ""Happy Summertime"" is a laid-back dream meetup of world-class sing-rappers, as Kelly and Snoop Dogg trade verses about harmony betwixt Cali and the Chi (including what just might be the hip-hop debut of Millennium Park). Kelly's catchy cadence keeps him afloat on the Missy-like ""Reggae Bump, Bump"" with Elephant Man or the martial reggaeton of ""Burn It Up"". Most likely to score the summer's barbecues are the straight hip-hop numbers: ""Playas Only"", featuring The Game, is already dominant, and ""Hit It Till the Morning"", with its itchy beats and rudimentarily effective Twista appearance, is waiting on deck. All the same, your tolerance for the album is contingent upon your appreciation for the more humor-shock slow grooves. Take the ""Trapped in the Closet"" cycle, for instance-- perhaps the most bizarre, audacious, brilliant undertaking a major artist has attempted in years. Its five parts close out the album, and that's a blessing to the listener, as one listen is probably enough for even the most die-hard concept-music fanatic. Tracks like ""Remote Control"" (despite its dandy Prince impression) and ""Sex Weed"" similarly run the risk of succumbing to their concept: After you've heard Kelly refer to his girl's ""sticky-icky"" once, subsequent listens fail to pack the same punch. But no matter your personal taste for songs like ""Put My T-Shirt On"", don't be so condescending as to think Kelly is being unintentionally funny-- there's no way R. can't know how Chappelle-like the line ""Lying here in the bed checking you out while you're in the bathroom, girl"" sounds, but clearly it doesn't bother him. Restraint fits R. Kelly about as well as suspenders and a bow tie, and shackling his libido is likely what led to the relative commercial bellyflop of last year's Happy People/U Saved Me. TP3 Reloaded might be an unfortunate title, but it's at least an accurate one: Chicago's musical skyscraper pops Viagra and strikes the phallic pose he knows best.","After a 2xCD examination of stepping and Jesus, Kels returns with an album about sex.

For newer listeners, it should be stressed that young Bill Callahan was very different from the mellow miniaturist of Supper and A River Ain't Too Much to Love. This is Smog at his lo-fiest and no-waviest, his most misogynistic and malicious. If you dislike the bookends of Accumulation: None, the distortion-drenched echo chamber ""Astronaut"" and the toneless no-fi dirge ""Hole in the Heart"", you should steer clear of Forgotten Foundation. But if you find those songs strangely magnetic for their sheer contrariness, and wonder how the competent, tranquil Smog of today earned his reputation for musical and lyrical malice, you'd do well to begin here. If you could get the taciturn singer to give a reason for deliberately releasing evil into the world, it's probable that the answer would come as a shrug: Because it is possible to do so. What are we to make of ""Evil Tyrant""? ""He saw the most beautiful girl on the island/ He knew that raping her was not the best way to impress her,"" Smog deadpans over a primitive beat and disjointed guitar runs. Or the sneered innuendo of the crashing ""97th Street"": ""Put a little bit of the city right in your mouth."" Is this social satire, or is Smog just an unsavory character? Why do we tend to interperet such stuff more favorably when it comes dressed in indie sackcloth instead of pop velour? Does he mean it, or is he investigating possibilities of expression simply because they exist? Even if they aren't confessional, what drives a person to make up such mean-spirited stories without the mitigating factor of moral judgment? Charitably, one imagines that Smog is bravely magnifying aspects of his psyche that many artists, in their quest to be liked, conceal, and that these are exactly the sort of questions his nastier efforts are intended to raise. Less charitably, he's just mean, and while one wants to group him with Bret Easton Ellis, Michel Houellebecq, and the Frogs, it's quite possible that the distinction between this camp's misanthropy and 50 Cent's is specious. While some of the songs have intrinsic musical interest-- ""Guitar Innovator"" is a gem, as Smog tape-splices heavily distorted vocal ejaculations into a sort of monstrously thrumming rhythmic engine-- many seek no end but dread, or, at best, an interested repulsion. It's the ""why"" and ""should"" of its existence that make Forgotten Foundation compelling, more of a theoretical gambit than a confessional one. We hope.","Drag City reissue of Bill Callahan's clangorous second album.

So yeah, Portland, Oregon's The Planet The are essentially Devo disciples, but their music is as carnal as it is calculated. Sounds like Brainiac, you say? Well, yeah, but The Planet The are more aptly framed rather than pigeonholed, falling squarely in the middle of the Devo-Brainiac spectrum. Unlike those other bands, TPT have a handful of infectious indie pop melodies, albeit ones mucked up by sputtering time signatures, clamorous sound effects, and squawking vocals. The Planet The seem more prone to backbreaking frenzy than pristine new wave pop-- they're more Hella than ""Hella Good"". Song structures seldom derail completely, but rather jar loose from the track before pulling everything together for an anthemic chorus hook. ""Wet Dust"" begins relatively clean cut with man and synthesizer in bubbly unison before the song spontaneously devolves into pathological moaning and dizzying chromatic guitar riffs. To the rescue comes the a massive refrain-- synths blaring, vocals straining, and drums raising Cain. This unstable formula pays dividends on standout track ""Please Don't Kill Myself"", combining rickety Pere Ubu time signatures with morbid paranoia á la the Unicorns. The track single-handedly propels The Planet The beyond new wave quacks like Numbers and Dynasty, bands that still struggle to affix feasible vocals to their fractured, over-baked instrumentation. Similarly, ""Please Don't Kill Myself"" does lose momentum on its protracted bridge, but the catchy staccato verse synth reemerges from the rubble and lulls the listener back into lo-fi pop euphoria. Unfortunately, You Absorb My Vision wears off its already porous pop coating by the album's final third. Back-to-back numbers ""Free Jewelry"" and ""Tighten Your Dreams"" hiss and snarl like morose Cex tirades, justifying reviewers' shackling of The Planet The to many unseasoned Tigerbeat6 rock acts. Still, even weaker late tracks ""Tennis"" and ""Envision My Zorb"" sport some nifty musical ideas, albeit less polished and fully integrated ones. They may be poking around in niches already claimed by previous bands, but these new wave dweebs got the smarts to pull it off without provoking wedgies, swirlies and/or petty lunch money theft from bullying traditionalists.","5RC band falls squarely in the middle of the Devo-Brainiac geek rock spectrum.

Theirs is a natural-- if perhaps not exactly blessed-- union, and together these four musicians (Nate and Brian of Mouthus, Mike and Maya of Double Leopards) opt to abandon the typical rock-based topography of sequential peaks, valleys and foothills in exchange for denser, more inert terrain that breathes and swells like a pulsating carpet of pine needles. Containing two 20-plus minute (or sidelong, vinyl fans might say) tracks, Tarpit rivals Thuja and other acts from the Jewelled Antler collective in its ability to transform its assortment of electronically sourced sounds into organic solids so amorphously plant-like that one could swear the structure of these pieces varies from one listen to the next. If forced to referee White Rock's constructions, I'd have to raise the glove of Double Leopards in a close decision, as the fragrant musk of Tarpit bears closer resemblance to the elliptical, droning suspensions of the Leopards' 2003 Halve Maen than to the crazed, unmoored electricity of previous Mouthus works like their 2004 Ecstatic Peace album Loam. But these untitled tracks clearly retain the apparent footprints of all participants, and the album's opening minutes do consist of a gauzy, rather Loam-like fabric of sculpted feedback. Before long, further indistinct elements of percussion and electronics emerge as gradually and imperceptibly as a wave of heat stroke, and by its halfway point this first track has settled into a tentative womblike pulse. Distant vocal mirages briefly materialize (or do they?) and then submit to the type of steady, humid rhythms one might expect to hear upon discovering a sinister factory conducting mysterious operations deep in the forest primeval. Unnamed track number two opens upon friendlier environs, its ambient swells of keyboards almost deciding upon a melody or two before dissipating into the itchy fog. Though this piece initially betrays no forward movement as such, periodic stretches of coordinated silence and opaque momentum shifts manage to help the music avoid utter stagnation. Likewise Tarpit also displays White Rock's tasteful, patient restraint as they forgo any cheap, perfunctory blasts of loose noise. So much so, in fact, that increasing the volume only manages to make the album sound somehow thicker rather than louder, a fact that makes Tarpit a particularly difficult listen when, say, your dishwasher is running. And as with many such non-choreographed documents of form-shifting improv, Tarpit can engender a peculiar anxiety in its listeners. Are these recordings truly representative of White Rock at peak form, or might the group have taken these pieces somewhere even farther on the next night, or the next? Would additional voices have enhanced or hindered this album's vaporous, mesmeric appeal? For the moment, however, we'll assume these questions can be answered in Tarpit's favor, and simply relish it for the nonchalantly captivating success that it appears now to be.","Yet another mutation of the always protean U.S. noise/drone/improv underground.

Multiply,Jamie Lidell,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd00ea9e61561daa75ee/1:1/w_160/2d1b7f73.jpg,2005-07-04 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4777-multiply/,Warp,"I first heard Multiply a few months ago, via mp3, without any accompanying press releases or literature to help contextualize it. A significant break from Jamie Lidell's prior work both as a solo laptop artist on Warp and as one half of Super_Collider (Chilean techno terrorist Christian Vogel carries the other half of that amulet), its breezy soul had me dreaming up back stories. Maybe these were all guest vocalists. Maybe Warp's promobot purposely mislabelled some old Stax record to put me off the scent. Maybe Lidell did some Logic voodoo on a vault of old soul reels and repurposed a bunch of lesser-heard Motown gems to fit a glitchier, Warp-friendly palette. The real answer was simpler than that. Nearly five years in the making, Multiply represents Lidell's dramatic transformation from a knob-twiddling laptopper to a red-blooded soul singer. Where Lidell's prior solo work enjoyed a well-earned reputation for being difficult and forbidding, Multiply is among the most accessible records Warp has ever released. Backed by instrumentation from the likes of Berlinite squatters such as Mocky and Gonzales, and fleshed out by Lidell's robust, full-bodied voice, Multiply has the spirit of classic Motown and Stax. Whether in the breezy, sun-drenched title track, the soulful creep of ""This Time"" or the closing ballad ""Game For Fools"", it's obvious that Lidell isn't afraid of channeling (or repeating) history. But while the song structures and Lidell's vocal style owe boatloads to the 60s and 70s, there's also a modern programming style at work here that separates him from modern day revivalists like, say, Sharon Jones. Listen to Multiply once and you'll be struck by how reverent it is; listen to it three times and you'll start to notice the microscopic digital artifacts and subtle tweaks that give it personality and pop. For all the talk about it being a throwback record, it's also true that a handful of these tracks probably couldn't have been made in 1995, much less '65. The wet funk of first single ""When I Come Around"" takes glitchy liberties with its percussion track and includes a stunning middle-8 where Lidell's vocal gets chopped, sliced and sprinkled over a merry-go-round; the goofy ""A Little Bit More"" sounds like nu-soul run through a slapstick plugin; the delirious funk of ""Newme"" is a nine-layer cake of boom-bap, Rhodes and horns, about six levels of which had to have been built after the fact, in the studio, on a computer. Anyway, if the Maximo Park record wasn't enough to signify the end of days for the Warp of old, this should do the trick. Not just because it's one of the label's most commercially viable releases in forever, but because it goes to great lengths to lovingly namecheck the very strands of soul (i.e. Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Stevie Wonder, etc.) that the old Warp very fastidiously avoided. While I'm not sure that people have as strong a sense of brand loyalty to Warp anymore, this is probably still going to go down in electronic music circles as one of the year's most polarizing records. But don't let the naysayers keep you from hearing this before the winter rolls around; boasting 10 gorgeous songs over a trim 40 minutes, this is exactly the kind of record you need in your summer.","One half of Super_Collider reinvents himself as a 21st century soulboy, capturing the spirit of classic Motown and Stax.

Illinois,Sufjan Stevens,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5755e6ef95969320ae3/1:1/w_160/48a46623.jpg,2005-07-04 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7514-illinois/,Asthmatic Kitty,"The best travel writers skew their journeys into pointed narratives, writing the story of the landscape by seizing all the weird, awkward bits that make it distinct. On first listen, Sufjan Stevens' latest installment of state-based chamber-folk, Illinois, sounds dangerously similar to 2003's Michigan, all chirping vocals and copious orchestration. Both records inadvertently validate East Coast stereotypes of tough Midwestern values: This is earnest, hard-working music, morally rooted and technically precise. Still, Stevens has always been a folk singer more in theory than in practice. He routinely ditches folk's scrappy, stripped-down aesthetics, but consistently embraces its stories-of-the-people unanimity. Consequently, Illinois is less about place than spirit. Stevens dutifully celebrates and indicts all the appropriate landmarks, isolating the highest and lowest points in Illinois history, but at its best, the album makes America feel very small and very real: A boy crying in a van, a girl with bone cancer, stepmothers, parades, bandstands, presidents, UFOs, cream of wheat, trains after dark, a serial killer, Bible study. Musically, Illinois is strange and lush, as excessive and challenging as its giant, gushing song titles. Despite employing a small army of backers (including a string quartet, the Illinoisemaker Choir, drummer James McAllister, trumpeter Craig Montoro, and a pile of extra vocalists), Stevens is more forefronted than on the comparably solo Seven Swans. Manning nearly every instrument in his arsenal (and some beyond-- Stevens recorded the piano parts at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn), Stevens conducts his friends with impressive grace. Stevens' pipes quiver generously; his vocals could be easily (perhaps accurately) read as precious, but they're really more intimate than emo, and always beautifully echoed by his backers. The colossal ""The Black Hawk War"" cartwheels slowly into a climax of strings and horns, gurgling and pushing, ostensibly signifying (with much aplomb) the violent return of the Sac and Fox Indians to Illinois. Stevens may be deploying state propaganda, or validating Black Hawk's push home, but no matter how grave its reality, the moment still lands like a giant, neon-cased WELCOME TO ILLINOIS billboard. Trumpets blare, submission looms, our eyes widen, it makes sense: Illinois. Is. The. Greatest. State. Of. All. TIME! The excellent ""Casimir Pulaski Day"" (named after an Illinois state holiday honoring the polish-born victor of the Battle of Brandywine) is a heartbreaking story of late winter death, bravely sung over rich banjo; the bubbly ""Decatur"" (the title of which is, awesomely, rhymed with ""alligator,"" ""aviator,"" and ""emancipator"") features one of Stevens' most undeniable melodies, the kind of pretty, tinkling cue that sends everyone in earshot twirling through the streets, jazz hands and all. Matthew Morgan yelps solid backing bits (see their gorgeously squeaky harmony on ""Stephen A. Douglass was a great debater/ But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator!""), while Daniel and Elin Smith (of Brother Danielson, and the Danielson Famile) chime in for a campfire finish, complete with self-applause. Stevens has a remarkable habit of being rousing and distressing at the same time, prodding disparate emotional centers until it's unclear whether it's best to grab your party shoes or a box of tissues. The gut-punching ""Chicago"" cagily celebrates the innate (and deeply American) tendency to employ highways as escape routes, ditching old mistakes for new swatches of land, new plates of eggs, new parking lots. Impossibly propulsive, each calm, harmonized, Illinoisemaker cry of ""All things go!"" pushes harder, promising liberation, by death or by automobile: ""If I was crying/ In the van with my friend/ It was for freedom/ From myself and from the land,"" Stevens chokes, voice shaking over a haze of drums, strings, and shimmering keyboards. ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr."" traces, with alarming accuracy, and over a hazy swirl of acoustic guitar and piano, the pathology of Illinois' most infamous serial killer: From 1972 until his arrest in 1978, Gacy was responsible for the torture, rape, and murder of 33 boys and young men, many of whom were discovered buried under the floorboards of his Norwood Park home. Lyrically, Stevens nails the specifics (as a kid, Gacy was slammed in the head by a swing, resulting in a blackout-inducing blood clot in his brain; he routinely donned a clown suit to entertain at a local hospital; victims were typically immobilized with chloroform-soaked cloths), and shifts perspectives gracefully; anchored in first-person, the song's narrator prods Gacy's mother and father, his neighbors, his victims, himself. More than any other track here, ""Gacy"" highlights Stevens' literary prowess, perfectly packed with nuance and detail. At seventy-four minutes, Illinois is an exercise in patience; considering how long it takes to dog paddle through all the gooey orchestration, chugging through Stevens' meticulous arrangements and parsing out the melodies, Illinois is a bit of a commitment. Its 21 tracks consist of a handful of transitional snippets (many arresting in their own right), and plenty of good stuff (""The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulder"", in particular) is buried way in the back, rewarding those who persevere, and in both theory and execution, Illinois is huge, a staggering collection of impeccably arranged American tribute songs.","On the second installment of his absurdly ambitious ""50 States"" project, Stevens presents the 74-minute spectacular Illinois. In the wake of last year's quieter Seven Swans, this album finds the baroque, full arrangements of Michigan reaching stunning, nuanced heights, with the help of a small army of backers-- including a choir and string quartet.

Psyche Out,Optimo,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c455ea9e61561daa8111/1:1/w_160/c9f9a34e.jpg,2005-07-01 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6107-psyche-out/,Eskimo,"Glasgow's Optimo have been packing them into their Sunday night sessions since 1997. I've never been, but in an era of shrinking club attendance (at least in the English-speaking world), the fact that they seem to be growing means they must be doing something right. That ""something"" is probably appealing to an utterly devoted yet wide audience. Optimo's founders and residents, JD Twitch and JG Wilkes, play everything from moldy old funk tracks to modern indie to hardcore acid to ragga dancehall. But before you recoil in horror at the thought of even more post-2 Many DJ's whimsy: they don't do mashups, they aren't into incongruous blends for their own sake (Ciara + Rednex...wheeee!), and they don't front like crossing genre and decade borders is reinventing the wheel. They just know what good DJs have known since Francis Grasso started blending funk and rock as a cruising soundtrack. Like the sampled Primal Scream preacher dude said, they know music is music. And if you're really good, you can blend it all and keep the floor filled all night. The Grasso reference isn't just me showing off what a knowledgeable guy I am. (Okay, maybe a little.) Way before 3/4ths of you (and me) were even alive, Grasso invented disco mixing by blending heavy rock and heavy funk (Santana, JB, War, etc.) for a rabid audience of newly sexually liberated future yuppies, guppies, and buppies. While Psyche Out contains plenty of music beyond Grasso's reach (everything that came after Giorgio Moroder, for instance), any mix that opens with Hawkwind and the Silver Apples and climaxes with the Chambers Brothers must capture a little of his feeling. Coming less than a year after their How to Kill the DJ Pt. 2 mix, Psyche Out is indeed heavy. HTKTDJ2 (phew) was impossibly flashy and virtuosic-- all jump cuts between scene, sound, and mood. Psyche Out is less manic, more roiling, brooding, cosmic. If anything unites the 40 years of music here, it's the compulsive, hypnotic power of repetition. From psyche rock to krautrock to disco to acid house to our own cannibalistic little fin de sicle, the tribe vibe of dancing your ass off in a dark, smoky room (or zoning out) (though that takes us dangerously close to Lazer Floyd territory so best to keep moving) still trumps doing coke in the bathroom and ""networking."" The middle section is one big throb. Acid (and the proto-acidic industrial that preceded it) has lost none of its futuristic blankness (those gnomic, endlessly circling riffs) and post-Atari jungle rite abandon. (The urge to strip naked and smear yourself with raw hamburger while envisioning yourself as an extra in Tron, in other words.) In its original form, Herbie Hancock's ""Raindance"" fires disembodied bleeps from a synthesizer the size of your couch into an inky black void (of the ""space, the final frontier"" sort). Here the Optimo boys direct those bleeps into the sticky center of Sweet Exorcist's ""Mad Jack"", an odd bit of gray techno-exotica, like if someone had dumped a rain forest into the middle of Sheffield. Carl Craig puts 21st century rims on the perverted Eurodisco of Throbbing Gristle's ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", but it barely needs them. (Sleazy disco, ironic or otherwise, transcends time and place, I guess.) And I have to admit I did a little ""woo!"" when they mixed up the Stranglers' ""Bear Cage"" with the ""giant ball bearings in the titular device"" beats of Mr. Fingers' ""Washing Machine"". Norman Whitfield's ""psychedelic soul"" productions for the Temptations helped usher disco into existence (really, no shit, The Wire told me so), and ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" is like trying to escape a black hole of molasses, all baritone gravitas and string melodrama. So they mix it into Koenig Cylinder's ""Carousel"", which is like being sucked into some kinda space tornado, all milky way swirls at top speed. (Sorry I'm getting so ridiculous simile crazy here, but the last twenty minutes of this mix are maybe the most exciting thing I've heard this year.) There's something similarly tornado-like about the drums on Dinosaur's ""Kiss Me Again"", which bring us back down to earth in time for Johnny Cash, winking at us silly disco bunnies from beyond the grave, to gently see us on our way. There's nothing remotely ""2005"" (you know, 50 Cent, Iraq, pornographic hamburger commercials) about any of this, but, hey, weren't we all supposed to have evolved into silicon-based lifeforms by now anyway? Or be dancing on the cinder following nuclear doomsday? There's just something heartening about the fact that we're still even mucking around in these meat bags, dancing to heavy repetitive music, doing lots of drugs, and enjoying that moment when the humid weather matches the humid music. Or laying on the floor staring into space. If you must. ","Glasgow duo play everything from old funk to modern indie to hardcore acid to ragga dancehall.

Besterberg: The Best of Paul Westerberg,Paul Westerberg,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa0613d1975652139971/1:1/w_160/cdf56fa2.jpg,2005-06-30 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8634-besterberg-the-best-of-paul-westerberg/,Rhino,"The Replacements were a teenager's band. Led by Paul Westerberg, who yearned for high notes more often than he actually hit them, they gave voice to all those knotty emotions that overwhelmed your 16-year-old self. Any band can do that, but Westerberg sang with the benefit of hindsight, and the message he sent from his twenties was crucial and reassuring; all those bursting, longing feelings were worthwhile and even useful out in the real world. In fact, the Replacements presented that emotional confusion as a kind of moral code with which the world could be understood, a compass with which to navigate life's disappointments and tragedies. Heard at the right age, this band truly could be your life. On his first collection of post-Replacements material, Besterberg: The Best of Paul Westerberg (which is a great title and begs a companion rarities comp called Resterberg), the former Replacement no longer sounds like a teenager in a twentysomething body. He's resolutely adult, more mature and perhaps more cautious of the world. He gives himself over completely to the na-na-na's on the ""cutesy"" (his word, not mine) ""Dyslexic Heart"" and the piss-and-vinegar of ""World Class Fad"", but Westerberg sings songs like ""Runaway Wind"" and ""Love Untold"" from a distance, a mere observer rather than a participant. Even the B-side ""Man Without Ties"", about spending Friday night with a frozen pizza, seems to be about someone else. ""A Star Is Bored"" (ironically, from the Friends soundtrack) trades adolescent disaffection for celebrity disaffection-- maybe Winona digs it, but the rest of us can't really identify with four-star hotel anomie. There are, however, a few moments on Besterberg when Westerberg deftly captures that sense of youthful confusion: On ""Stain Your Blood"" he sings ""Stay the night just for fun"" with the desperation either of a kid whose parents are away for the weekend or of an adult who really doesn't want to face the morning alone. His characters are essentially the same no matter how many years separate them, but searching for the boy inside the man proves much more fruitful for Westerberg than finding the adult in the boy. On ""Love Untold"" he sings of a young romance that ends before it starts, but besides the grinding guitar solo, the song sounds saccharine. Amazingly, Besterberg works better as an album than his first three proper albums. Not only does it reject the worsterberg, but it also presents its own solid story of high hopes and low pay-off. The first half of the album finds him playing it relatively safe, perhaps in a bid for post-Replacements respectability (and who doesn't deserve it more?), but as 14 Songs and Eventually tank, he grows pricklier and his music sounds rawer and more inhabited, his trajectory mirroring that of his idol, Alex Chilton. This prickliness becomes Westerberg, even when he assumes his Grandpaboy persona. As a result, Besterberg gets better as it proceeds and as Westerberg grows more comfortable just left of the spotlight. ""Let the Bad Times Roll"" roils with offhanded resignation, and he sings ""What a Day (for a Night)"" with the dreamy sigh of someone who can't believe his dumb luck. On ""All That I Had"", which was inexplicably relegated to B-side status, Westerberg erases any distance between himself and the song and explains himself better than anyone else can: ""Didn't follow my dreams/ I lost the map/ I lived my fantasy instead/ Until I found it was a trap/ Gave a life, got a living/ Hey, that's all right, all's forgiven.""","First-ever collection of the post-Replacements work of Paul Westerberg.

The record paid homage to krautrock mainstays Can and Kraftwerk while dishing out thick, dissonant arrangements. In a nutshell: All music-dork killer, no hipness-jaded filler. Reductive, yeah, but the band earned the comparisons-as-compliments: ""Caesar's Column"" was the best song since, like, ""Clocks"". It rocked, was anthemic, and had the lacerating guitars and intricate arrangement to make Hella kid wet himself. The Oneida of The Wedding are much less eager to please. The new full-length is playfully scatterbrained, careening from shamanic, drone-backed narcotics (""The Eiger"", ""Charlemagne"") to hypnotic rockers (""Lavender"", ""You're Drifting""). I'm no longer convinced Oneida are happy to master favorite band referentiality. I mean, it's like they're settling into their own, profoundly complex voice, content to ride out any turbulence along the way. Stubborn kids. Just settling in? On this, their seventh album? Precisely. Any band willing to mess with self-exploration at this point in their career have either got nothing to lose or plan on sticking around. Having established a sizable following, Oneida would be jerks to call this their swan song when there's this collection of vibrant, unexplored tributaries begging to be rafted down. ""The Eiger"" laces grunting, polyrhythmic strings under nightingale vocals with palpable feeling. ""Lavender"" evokes Boredoms and Parts & Labor in its organ atmospheres and steady snare slams while tucking in a slyly harmonious vocal. Tuneful vocals, wha? I thought this was soupy psych-rock hour? Well, technically it still is. But gone here is the Glass-ian stoicism of the band's erstwhile material. In its strongest moments, The Wedding balances emotionally vulnerability atop card-houses of mind-numbing repetition. Only ""Spirits"", which capitulates to white guy sitar fetish á la ""The End"" and ""Did I Die""-- the album's requisite random primal scream therapy-- feel out of place. This isn't a new Oneida, but a veteran band fortified for the long haul. Brooklyn prides itself on its intrepid tyros-- by its longevity standards, Oneida are a veritable high-school sweetheart story. Hopefully come 2015 they'll still be pwnin' noobs.","Seventh album finds the indie rock band still evolving and exploring new sounds.

"The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 2: 1962",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a836b1335d7bf169921f/1:1/w_160/18ad2f70.gif,2005-06-30 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2065-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-2-1962/,Hip-O Select,"The performers couldn't enter through the front door at most venues when the first Motown revue swung through the Deep South on tour. It was 1962, and busloads of Freedom Riders were still fresh in the minds of conservative white southerners, a fact that made the trip harrowing for the Hitsville recording artists whom label founder Berry Gordy had packaged together for the revue. Gordy's intent was to build the brand of Motown, get the word into people's heads, get them thinking not just about the next Miracles or Marvelettes single, but about the next single coming out on Motown, no matter what it was. But his timing in that summer brought an inadvertent association with the Civil Rights movement to the label. Here was a black-owned record label with a mostly black roster of artists exhibiting its wares in the heart of a region that was trying its hardest to send these very people to the margins of society and keep them there-- it was inspiring to many, even if Gordy's only real intent was to sell more records and score some hits on the pop chart. Of course he succeeded in that, and Motown today is a word people use like Kleenex or Xerox, a brand name so iconic that it came to define an entire aesthetic sensibility and style of songwriting. No one talks about the Vee Jay Records sound the same way no one asks you to hand them a Puffs before sneezing-- Motown simply towered over all of its independent brethren for about two decades, and the Hitsville song factory set the gold standard for 60s r&b.; By 1962, Motown's fourth year of operation, the hits were a regular occurrence and Gordy had established an artist development department to coach his growing stable of performers, most of whom were barely in their early 20s at that point, if they were even that old. It would be a few years until the label itself was firmly ensconced in the collective American consciousness, but as the second volume in Hip-O Select's Complete Motown Singles series proves, the label already had a signature sound and an almost universally high quality level on its releases. Pleasures abound on the four discs of singles and B-sides compiled here, including numerous smashes you can still hear on the radio on any given day. Marvin Gaye progresses from a genuinely bizarre version of ""Mr. Sandman"", full of spooky vibes and queasy backing vocals, to his first taste of success with ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"", whose opening chorus of ""Say yeah, yeah, yeah"" is one of the easiest instructions to follow in recorded song. By the end of the set, Marvin's on to ""Hitch Hike"" and stardom, which is the kind of thing that makes it easy to forget that these discs only cover a single year of the label's output. Gaye's nascent stardom was nothing at that point relative to that of the Marvelettes, the Miracles, and Mary Wells, all of whom have their moments here. It's almost impossible to believe that Smokey Robinson's perfect ""You've Really Got a Hold on Me""-- a song that's since become one of the true standards of the rock 'n' roll era-- was originally a B-side, but that's how spoiled the label was for quality material by then. Robinson also wrote Mary Wells' ""Two Lovers"", which mixes sly humor perfectly with a nuanced vocal and that airy production style that today can only be called the Motown sound. New arrivals at the label that year included two who would soon be among Motown's biggest stars: Martha Reeves (with the Vandellas) and Little Stevie Wonder, at the time only 12 years old. Even then, Wonder was an outstanding harmonica player and a strong singer who sounds significantly beyond his years on ""I Call It Pretty Music but the Old People Call It the Blues"". Both the Supremes and the Temptations had a prolific year in the studio, but both were still searching for a breakout hit. The Supremes' ""Your Heart Belongs to Me"", a beguiling letter to a soldier from the girl he left back home, probably should have been huge, but only managed to scrape the bottom of the chart despite the wide reach of its subject matter in an era of massive military buildup and increasing entanglement in Southeast Asia. Just as with the first volume of the series, there are dozens of tracks with no other logical home that nonetheless deserve a listen. The Temptations' ""Isn't She Pretty"" is a crazy doo-wop song with Eddie Kendricks flying around in Frankie Valli territory with bass Melvin Franklin trucks away down at the bottom. The eccentric Gino Parks gets in a hypercharged, shouting performance on ""Fire"", backed by the full force of the Hitsville house band horn section, while Mike & the Modifiers' sole single, ""I Found Myself a Brand New Baby"", is an ultra-catchy bit of blue-eyed soul that excellent liners correctly peg as a premonition of the British Invasion. And it goes on from there. The Contours rock hard on ""Do You Love Me?,"" Eddie Holland turns in a handful of great vocal performances that make you wonder why his career as a singer never took off the way his career as a writer did, and you even get a bit of Grieg-referencing jazz on the Earl Washington All-Stars' ""Opus No. 3"". And that's the real brilliance of this series-- laying out the Motown singles discography in its entirety, warts and all, gives you a picture of an era you could never piece together just by listening to the hits. Even in its early stages, Motown was a force to reckon with, and on this set you can hear the language changing, expanding just enough to include the word Motown and all of its associations.","Second volume in Hip-O's invaluable crawl through the Tamla Motown archives.

The Ultimate Collection,Billie Holiday,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a6ea9e61561daa4858/1:1/w_160/05099768.gif,2005-06-30 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4014-the-ultimate-collection/,Hip-O Select,"Since she died strung out and broke in 1959, the perception of Billie Holiday's art has hardened around the grim facts of her biography. She's a primary figure in the Cult of Pain pantheon, alleged proof that the black coal of bad circumstances and poor choices can sometimes be compressed into an artistic diamond. Her signature song was ""Lady Sings the Blues"", and while she preferred to think of her work in the tradition of smooth, sophisticated pop, her life was filled with sadness from the beginning. Still a teenager when she first dabbled in heroin and prostitution, Holiday was a successful singer in her early 20s and died before reaching 50. We're told about the suffering inside her weary phrasing and when she delivered a line like ""I'd rather my man would hit me then for him to jump up and quit me"" and ""I swear I won't call no copper if I'm beat up by my poppa"" in ""'Taint Nobody's Business if I Do"", we remember her destructive taste in lovers and the never-ending string of abusive relationships. The words she croaked on the Lady in Satin album, recorded a few months before her death, are received as an epitaph. It wasn't always so. As heard in the early tracks on this 2xCD/DVD collection, when she was just a kid fronting pianist Teddy Wilson's band she sang with infectious energy and a child's enthusiasm. ""What a Little Moonlight Can Do"" from 1935 is a joyous up-tempo floor-filler and Holiday sounds silly but self-aware, one step away from leaving the bandstand and joining the party herself. At this point she hadn't yet developed her extreme behind-the-beat lag (a quality Miles Davis claimed as an influence) but the timbre of her unmistakable voice was intact. ""I Cried for You"" from the following year is a bit slower but no less buoyant, and the mid-tempo ballad ""Mean to Me"" from 1937, though about a deadbeat boyfriend, is delivered with sass and humor. The Ultimate Collection deserves credit for assembling tracks from a number of different labels, allowing us to hear the changes in style and approach from year to year. Holiday's music got heavier by the late 30s, the time of the darkly brilliant allegory ""Strange Fruit"" and ""God Bless the Child"". This period through the mid-40s is when Holiday recorded her most famous sides, including ""Billie's Blues"", ""Don't Explain"", and ""Good Morning Heartache."" The second disc begins with Holiday getting the string section she always wanted, the sweetness of the orchestrations serving as a steadily contrasting frame to her deteriorating voice. Songs like ""You're My Thrill"" and ""Crazy He Calls Me"" have a disturbing gothic quality as Holiday sounds aged beyond her years, and on spare ballads in front of a small combo like ""Detour Ahead"" and ""It Had to Be You"" she seems aware of her tragic stature as she drifts off pitch and never sounds convincing expressing warmer sentiments. By the time of the sole Lady in Satin selection ""I'm a Fool to Want You"" she sounds exhausted, like someone who wants to lay down for a long, long time. The heavy reverb on her voice and the lush strings are weird and disorienting, almost an attempt to throw her shortcomings to sharp relief. A few months later she was gone.","2xCD set compiles the best work from the legendary singer.

No Wait Wait,No Wait Wait,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9835e6ef9596932299a/1:1/w_160/82d5c146.jpg,2005-06-29 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5916-no-wait-wait/,Chairkickers Union,"Love, for all its immeasurable glories, is also the oldest cliché in the book. Meanwhile, the post-flannel alt-pop of bands like Weezer, the Rentals, or Superchunk isn't cliché per se, but it weaves together guitar-pop's most-worn threads: chunky guitars, ooh-ah harmonies, geeky romance lyrics. No Wait Wait, headed by Marc Gartman, aids me in employing a rockwriterly cliché by embracing such touchstones while also subverting them. To Gartman, either love's a joke, or he's just telling himself that. On catchy first single ""The Score"", Gartman sports a Ben Folds slacker drawl as he slips into deep denial about amour. ""There's nothing real about the pain of love,"" he sings on Navy Blues-era Sloan-like opener ""Faith and Words"". A jocularly Jurassic guitar solo only blurs the question. The supine ""A Worried Mind Ventures"" wades into wimpy college-rock with splashes of Murmur-era R.E.M. or even Toad the Wet Sprocket, but now Gartman is hiding his hurt behind hep references: ""You are my Nico."" Apparently his would-be Warhol pinup can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground, because in the Joe Jackson piano-pop of ""The Luckiest Bastard"" she goes off to ""star"" on Hollywood Blvd., and ""this ain't a Hollywood ending"". Gartman's subject matter is basic, and he doesn't take it far afield, but sometimes he pushes the typical heartache just enough. Much of the album conveys that lyrical content through 90s-style alt-pop like that mentioned above, buoyed by hooky synths and raw production. On ""Beaches of the World"", Gartman veers briefly into teenage territory: ""The jocks can't make you laugh/ And the geeks just do your math."" But often, No Wait Wait offset their upbeat bounce with spacious slowcore, in the classic Low mold, as on the dizzying highlight ""Love's Lost Cause"". No surprise, then that Low's Alan Sparhawk plays in the band, and released the album on his label. While the more deliberately paced songs sometimes drag, they provide a nice addition the record's palette. So Gartman is a bitter, witty, self-deceiving ex-romantic who rocks like the recent oldies but steps on the decelerator like a veteran city driver. The songs on No Wait Wait's self-titled review are rarely unique enough to merit a long recall, but they often capture the heart with their lyricism and effervescent melodies. The pain of love is real, Mr. Gartman, but so is the moderate amusement of pretty-good power pop.","Chunky guitars, ooh-ah harmonies, and geeky romance lyrics á la Weezer.

Spry From Bitter Anise Folds,Fifths of Seven,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beb6eb335119a49ed0d5/1:1/w_160/d7073274.jpg,2005-06-29 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3341-spry-from-bitter-anise-folds/,DSA,"As you might suspect from a Montreal band issuing a record with an unwieldy title, Spry From Bitter Anise Folds is the work of another addition to the extended Constellation family of wayward instrumentalists. Providing the shortest ancestral link is cellist Beckie Foon, who has played with A Silver Mt. Zion and Set Fire to Flames, with pianist Spencer Krug (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown, Frog Eyes) and mandolin player Rachel Levine (Cakelk) connected by slim degrees of separation as well. And though they utilize familiar ingredients, the trio's rigorous, European folk-inflected chamber music manages to sound quite distinct from anything else in their musical genealogy, resulting in this exquisite, understated pearl of a debut. Given the high activity rate of all three group members-- Krug in particular is having himself one hell of a busy year-- their collaboration as Fifths of Seven risks seeming an afterthought or mere side project trifle, but there is no evidence on these eight collected pieces that anyone's talents have been spread too thin. Throughout the album the three each play with an intuitive delicacy that suggests many hours together in the rehearsal suite, with Levine's mandolin providing an earthy, vaguely Mediterranean air to dynamic compositions that can recall the small-ensemble works of Erik Satie, Gabriel Fauré, or contemporary acts like Rachel's. On many of their best tracks here, such as the opening ""Rosa Centrifolia"" or the stately ""Echoes From a Wandered Path"", the music functions without a true center, as each instrument moves continually and transparently from foreground to rear without ever breaking stride. Witness also Foon's deft, sonorous playing on ""Sweet Grace For Devious"", as she glides in and around her cello's upper registers, sharing melodic duties with Krug's austere piano. For his part, Krug here appears to betray a preference for detuned upright pianos, as evidenced by his solo turn on ""Waiting"", which sounds as though it could've been performed on some old tack in an empty VFW hall. For ""Out From Behind the Rigid Bellows"", Krug swaps piano for accordion, the three musicians conjuring the mesmeric groans of a ghost ship's riggings as it sails from one exotic port of call to the next, while on the closing ""Bless Our Wandering Dreamers"" they combine to join into impressively robust drones, distant strains of mandolin and cello hovering about the edges like the rapidly fading memory of a dream upon waking. Of all the tracks on the album, it's this final cut that most audibly contains evidence of improvisation, suggesting bold new possibilities for future Fifths of Seven projects, as hopefully the three musicians find time to become even further comfortable in each other's creative company.","New project from cellist Beckie Foon (A Silver Mt.

You Can Get It If You Really Want,Desmond Dekker,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb6eb335119a49ecad6/1:1/w_160/c752e73d.jpg,2005-06-29 05:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2615-you-can-get-it-if-you-really-want/,Trojan,"Ska, through no fault of its own, has taken a bit of a critical beating. Dub is now seen as so essential to the history of late 20th century music that to question its importance feels almost heretical. Its brother, roots reggae, has suffered a bit from benign neglect, but its place in the canon is assured. (There's always a new generation of college kids buying Wailers' records for the first time.) Dancehall, of course, is at the peak of its hipster acclaim. Ska was a hybrid of American r&b;, jazz, and a burgeoning move towards traditional Jamaican music, which ska-core nonsense has leached out over the last two decades. Jamaican ska is indeed uptempo, and the 2-Tone artists (like mods with their soul records) located the rave-up impulse lurking within. But the original ska was also music to work your hips to. By the time it found mass success, it was already slowing down to the swaying tempo of rocksteady and soon after that, reggae. It was also the birth of Jamaican music's enduring admixture of all-night dancing and social comment. You Can Get It If You Really Want, Trojan's excellent greatest-hits collection of the work of Desmond Dekker, captures all of this history and evolution on two CDs. It's also a mess of music, much of it transcendent and even the mediocre stuff still pretty good. Before Bob Marley, Dekker was perhaps the island's biggest music export, and he was huge star at home. He was a committed entertainer, but he also firmly believed that music had the power to uplift and educate. The first three songs here-- ""Honour Your Father and Mother"", ""Parents"", and ""Labor For Learning""-- all extol the virtues of staying in school, listening to your folks, and getting good grades. With some nice brass and rhythm guitar to boot. The first went all the way to No. 1 in Jamaica, and soon he was rightfully calling himself the King of Ska, which provided the title of his next major hit, a smoking definition of the genre backed by the Maytals (under the name the Cherrypies). Fired up by his own badass success, he injected a tougher than tough streak into his ""yes sir/yes ma'am"" persona and recorded ""007 (Shanty Town)"", an all-time rude boy anthem. In 1968, five years after he debuted as a polite young man, he released the gorgeous, numinous ""Israelites"", fraught with religious implications and sufferer's woe, as the music had slowed to the lilt of rocksteady on its way to reggae's rolling thunder fundamentalism. It went to No. 1 in the UK, and, more amazingly, made the top 10 in the U.S. These songs are the bedrock of Dekker's legend. A charming, rinky-dink organ so irritating in the hands of later ska imitators shows up for a blip on ""Problems"". Dekker knows when not to let a sound wear out its welcome. This extends to the brevity of the songs themselves, a value crammed 31 on the first disc and 28 on the second. Many of the best tunes here barely clear the 2:30 mark. Dekker runs through a jaunty cover of the Beatles' ""Ob-la-di Ob-la-da"" (who do you think the ""Desmond"" in the song is?) and his generosity slips a bit of the haunting, gorgeous ""Wise Man"" on the outro. Blink and you'll miss it. So play it again. On Disc 2, unexpected string flourishes play off the gentle ecstasy of Dekker's vocal on ""Perseverance""; if this is commercialization, then it's a kind I can appreciate. Jimmy Cliff's ""You Can Get It If You Really Want"" is such a classic it barely needs mentioning. Its sentiment may have been na\x95ve even by the early 70s, but I can't help but think we could still use a little of that positivity and self-belief today. Strings crop up on much of Dekker's early-70s work, product of his move to London, which marked a softening of his sound and (ironically) and end to the hits. Dekker's fey, fluttering falsetto makes the softening superfluous. Like many of the great Jamaican vocalists, there's an unmistakable feminine quality to his voice that contrasts the baritone croak of the toaster. (Though if you're not expecting it, his hilarious Louis Armstrong impression on ""Live And Learn"" will knock you on your ass.) On ""Archie Wah Wah"", the strings get ditched for the bounce and Dekker floats back down to an earth where the girls are so plentiful (like gravel!) he can't help but holler at 'em. Plus he could still thrill instrumentally; the guitar on ""Warlock"" sounds like Morse code played on a clothesline. The later work with his biggest fans the Specials is just making time, but there's no shame in retelling the story of how you climbed the tallest mountain if you actually made it up the damn thing. You Can Get It probably could have been trimmed back to a more listenable single disc. That disc is still lurking in here and it's one of the great Jamaican albums. How many of you can say the Beatles wrote a song about you?","2xCD, 59-track collection compiles the best of the King of Ska.

Don't Save Us From the Flames / Teen Angst,M83,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be01abf31b7dc7156094/1:1/w_160/76b59ad5.jpg,2005-06-29 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11776-dont-save-us-from-the-flames-teen-angst/,Mute,"M83 occupies a summer-sky-sized space between dance music, electro-pop, indie rock, and ambient, and this vastness is well suited to the long player format: Saturate and inundate, goosebumps ensue. If M83's goal was to choose infectious singles that also render the album proper in miniature, they nailed it with ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"" and ""Teen Angst"", each of which distills the album's delirious crescendos and evocative lulls into concise packets. Don't Save Us From the Flames comes with two remixes and ""Until the Night Is Over"", an acoustic version of ""Night"" from their self-titled debut. Right after the panoramic drums, driving guitar, ecstatic synth trills, propulsive piano, and rapturous harmonies of the title track, ""Until the Night Is Over"" treats us to six minutes of lambent piano and M83's most negligible component-- the vocals. It's innocuously pleasant, but squanders a track that could've been better served by another remix. Boom Bip does a decent job of recasting ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"" as instrumental indie-hop that would've fit right in on his own last album. He drizzles disassociated fragments of the source material into the back half, placing more emphasis on his tweaky mechanical drums, electronic squiggles, and tiny chimes, and his version seems more like a translation than a remix. It's Superpitcher's remix that extends this single's audience beyond diehard collectors. Grabbing it by each end and stretching it like electro-taffy for upwards of 10 minutes, Superpitcher isolates the individual parts of ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"", opening up the spaces between them so that each becomes a distinct rhythmic agent, and expertly deploys them in a tense arc. The song's lean two-note pulse and mammoth bass line ride a sultry house beat, and Anthony Gonzalez's voice shimmers in the air. The Interpol-ish bridge puts in a climactic appearance; ghost harmonies and guitar flourishes flit through the mix, and by keeping the track stark, spacious and incrementally shifting, Superpitcher creates an accurate exploded diagram with a sensual impact that belies its clinical tone. Teen Angst is rounded out by a non-album track and a remix by Montag (who should be intimately familiar with the source material, having composed most of M83's string arrangements). ""Addicted to Self-Mutilation"" is a generous seven minutes of ballroom electrofuzz, a gorgeous if somewhat tepid wash of buried falsettos and mid-tempo, morphing incandescence. This is the M83 of wafting, blissed-out sonics, not the sharp dynamic shifts of their singles, and it dovetails nicely with the Starsy neon pop of ""Teen Angst"". Montag ratchets the ping-ponging synths of the original down to a soupier growl, gives the vocals a little more breathing room, trims some overdrive off of the chorus, and drops some of his trademarked crystalline tones in the middle, but otherwise doesn't go very far in re-imagining the track or revealing something about it that had been hidden, the way Superpitcher seems to illuminate the viscera of ""Don't Save Us from the Flames"". These two singles are clearly divided by their strengths and weaknesses. Both sport solid title tracks. Teen Angst features the better of the two new tracks available, but Don't Save Us From the Flames has far and away the best remix. M83 fanatics will want to pick up both; casual fans are advised to pick up one or the other (depending on whether studio tracks or remixes are more your speed), and everyone with ears should drop 99 cents at iTunes for the Superpitcher remix.","Two recent singles pulled from M83's third album, Before the Dawn Heals Us.

Favela Strikes Back,Diplo,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb88c0084474cd0c28a1/1:1/w_160/7333aa3f.gif,2005-06-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2571-favela-strikes-back/,self-released,"I haven't done the first graf kinda-sorta relevant anecdote bit in a while (or the meta thing), so forgive me: During my two month riff in Rome, I sacked the eternal city for the real what have you's-- what real Italians wear, where real Italians hang out at night, how real Italians ride real Italian scooters. Three-button collared party shirts are the hot shit, but one arm in I realized I didn't have the chest hair. So the rest of the summer I stuck to wearing ""I Survived the Pantheon"" tees and having my wallet stolen-- tourist stuff, comfortable but me. Diplo does the tourist thing too-- obviously there's some give/take w/r/t how much control he has over that-- but beginning-to-end he approaches baile funk with, vaguely we'll say, hip-hop sensibilities. (Or better, Hollertronix sensibilities, where bass, Dirty South, Baltimore, and ""Sweet Dreams"", among others, peacefully co-exist.) Baile funk aka favela funk aka funk has been doing the crazy Portuguese screaming over Miami bass and U.S. pop kitsch thing for decades now-- we're just finding out about it. The tracks we're hearing on Diplo's through-the-backdoor mixes (his first trip to Brazil yielded last year's Favela On Blast) aren't necessarily groundbreaking or definitive for the genre (how would we know?), just the ones off Diplo's Rio-bought comps he thought people'd dig. He liked the stuff simply by how it sounded-- imagine that. Track 5 (no song titles; more re: that in a sec) snatches something from Grease, I think, and throws it back hi-ho silver digital cowboy, etc. Then there's a part where all these dogs start barking-- always glad to hear some of that. The sixth track has James Brown breaks, which I don't remember from the other comps, so that's cool, and track 11 has a Prodigy line on it. Track 15 samples a song I'm probably supposed to know; it's OK. Other songs you may have heard in parts on Diplo's criminally overlooked Piracy Funds Terrorism Vol. 1 mixtape, which he put together with Sri Lankan-via-London artist-singer M.I.A.. Which makes me wonder: If there are baile tracks that we're hearing and saying ""Oh, this is an old one,"" I can only imagine how these tracks fit into a current Rio set. Elsewhere there's all the hora, rinkydink Italian wedding carmina, and crazy sing-scream MCs whose sound falls somewhere between dancehall toasters and the grime kids. Baile funk is ""make do with what you got"" music-- it's a fun dance at best (and worst), hardly self-conscious to my ears, raw and celebratory in that amateur talent/lotta heart way whose spirit-- kill me-- I find strangely kin to the good-precious side of American indie. And god I hate to bring this up but: While there's some dubiously transferrable hip-hop morality at work here with mixtapes copping songs that themselves copped songs, Diplo's on some honest-to-badness culture-vulture shit that understandably rubs dudes the wrong way. Worse, his no artist/no song title thing might trick people into thinking ""It all sounds the same to Diplo, he's overgeneralizing!"", which I think reflects more on the accuser than the accused. But 10 wrongs do make five rights, and if Diplo's shtick is bringing this shanty to the world in a way they might respond to and ultimately might take vested interest in (read: $$$), then let's drop the charges for now and indulge the music as wide-eyed as he does.","Diplo's self-released follow-up to his baile funk primer Favela on Blast.

At only 264 words, Lincoln delivered the inspiring oration in approximately six minutes, with phrases like ""of the people, by the people, and for the people"" leaving an indelible imprint on America. At 1:37, Battletorn's Villains/Reversed is a curt ""fuck you"" from the New York metal underground band-- and very vehemently not for the people. This nihilistic Brooklyn trio must enjoy irking people with the brevity thing (their shows notoriously last between five and 11 minutes), but how does one ignore the fact that the record's length carries a stronger statement than the music itself? I know, I know, Mike Patton's been pulling these hijinks with Fantômas too, but he's got cred and, well, everyone's just accepted that he's bat-shit insane at this point. And yes, this may be purported as a mere seven-inch, but it feels like a teaser for their full-length to be released later in the year. And not a very enticing one at that. Even if limited by the stingiest of word counts, I could allot each second of music a full word here. However, Battletorn's sound hardly warrants such fine-tooth combing. This is bare-bones metalcore copped from the mid-80s NYC underground, sporting über-obscure influences like Sin 34 and the Comes. Unfortunately, while the songs' BPM and volume are jacked, the ideas are pretty ho-hum. But hey, that's the danger of a guitar/drums dynamic-- most songs can't be propped up by palm-muting, jarring chromatics, and ubiquitous cymbal crashes alone. Don't get me wrong, the power chord progressions here aren't terrible, but a riff or two along with some more unpredictable percussion fills wouldn't hurt. Most intriguing on these two brief noise spasms is lead singer Beverly's grating howl. The distortion surrounding her vocals is more calculated than the average metal singer's fuzz and feedback, and her shrieks emit the Transylvanian creepiness of a female Hisham Baroocha. The catch? We're only offered a glimpse of the only truly captivating aspect of this band. If this little snippet's potential is in any way valid, then hopefully their next release will at least be long enough for people to listen to on the car ride to work. If not, they could always try commercial jingles.","Brooklyn trio delivers a record that lasts less than two minutes.

The Definitive Ol' Dirty Bastard Story,Ol’ Dirty Bastard,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba4713d197565213b047/1:1/w_160/a46eb4a5.gif,2005-06-28 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6105-the-definitive-ol-dirty-bastard-story/,Rhino,"With his posthumous release A Son Unique enduring endless delays thanks to the diminishing specter of Damon Dash (who signed ODB to Roc-A-Fella in 2003 and spearheaded the project), ODB currently has only two solo albums to his credit. (The pathetic 2002 cash-in attempt The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones was a callous hodge-podge of an album that had little to do with Dirty.) Seemingly for the sake of symmetry alone, there are now two best-of retrospective collections dedicated to the man's tragically brief solo career as well: 2001's label-contract fulfilling The Dirty Story and this highly repetitive, largely unnecessary 16-track CD/DVD combo. The existence of such a superfluous disc is even more idiotic considering Return to the 36 Chambers and Na Please are both so chock full of classic material that listening to them straight through is an undeniable pleasure that needn't be tampered with.* Given the shamelessly exploitative nature of this release (""Let 'em know you're Dirty!"" spouts a craven insert promoting ODB ringtones), there are a couple of short-but-sweet bonuses for hardcore fans on the accompanying DVD. The extra disc features his excellent, insane music videos for ""Brooklyn Zoo"", ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"", and ""Got Your Money"". A hip-hop answer to Weezer's ""Happy Days""-sampling ""Buddy Holly"" video, ""Got Your Money"" tries the same trick with Dolemite to hilarious effect, inserting obviously mis-matched ODB footage from the ""Shimmy"" clip to make up for then-troubled artist's absence. And Dirt's Funkadelic, brain-fried performance in the pre-Austin Powers afro flashback clip for ""Shimmy"" may be the best visual depiction of his genius ever recorded. But, fact is, those videos aren't new and you've probably seen them many times before. The only footage included that fans may not be familiar with is a 1995 TV ""interview"" that sees ODB, the RZA, and a small army of hangers-on walking, talking, drinking 40s, and spontaneously freestyling through the streets of New York (""Niggas comin' through the trees like a salamander/ Bitin' like a piranha/ But I'm bitin' you back like a Black Panther!"" goes one spectacular Dirty outburst). It's as brilliant as it sounds. At one particularly inspired point, Dirt puts forth an ambitious Wu mission: ""Destroying all that negativity that's in the world, we emblemishing [sic] all that!"" Also, during a rare moment of relative calm, he sadly predicts future problems, ""I already witnessed death, kid-- and the death was to be dead mentally."" Whether he's inadvertently spitting at the camera lens or advertently fogging it up, the too-short exhibition of all things Dirty will undoubtedly, and sadly, having you wishing for more of his singular charms. No matter how good the uncovered footage is, though, it's probably not worth the almost $20 list price. For the real story, the uninitiated would be best served by doling out a few more bucks and picking up Dirt's two accomplished solo LPs.","New, unnecessary ODB compilation collects the best from his two studio LPs.

The band's debut album was a stately collection of elegant, nocturnal soundtracks for interstellar travel. Dark End Road has the two-step rhythms of classic country-- edges hung with fiddle, harmonica, and pedal steel-- and it also glows with spectral organ and washes of astral guitar and flute, all of it marinating in about a million cubic miles of reverb. On ""Dark End Road"" and ""Emily"", relatively conventional country songs stuffed with two-part harmonies and twanging guitar, the edges unravel with echoing steel guitar and organ, giving Lee's pleasant, low-key vocals a dusky, galactic texture to slip into. The entire album seems to unfold amidst a backdrop of dark, psychedelic matter, the kind of sound that doesn't make itself openly known, but whose weight undeniably affects the feel of the entire record. A sweet, even insecure, ballad like ""Snow Is Silver"" has a certain low-level glow to it that elevates it beyond its status as the slowest, sparsest track on the disc. The lynchpins of the album are undoubtedly two early, majestic songs that distill the mix of the down-to-earth and the interstellar to its purest state. Opener ""The One I Love Is Gone"" shambles in with a beguiling blend of viscerally recorded fiddle (you can hear the scraping of the bow) and black hole organ, Lee's voice and acoustic guitar settling into the cosmic goo as comfortably as they might on a porch step. ""The Way You Were"", on the other hand, is a majestic stroll across the planes on a star-filled night. Vibes, synths and heavily reverbed flutes slide through the mix, anchored by Lee's guitar and voice, and electric guitars twang along on the margins. This is the second well-realized album from Lowlights, and though I enjoyed the hazy sprawl of their debut a bit more than Dark End Road, this is a strong sophomore showing that significantly broadens the band's palette.","Country and space-rock intersect on this Darla release.

Acid: Can U Jack? Chicago Acid and Experimental House 1985-1995,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e913d1975652139528/1:1/w_160/269bd2b3.gif,2005-06-28 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1995-acid-can-u-jack-chicago-acid-and-experimental-house-1985-1995/,Soul Jazz,"Acid was a dance craze that became a culture. Read a lot of the literature at the time (at least in the U.S.) and you'd think you were reading early 60s descriptions of the mashed potato and the popcorn. (Something the music reinforced with all those ""this is how u jack"" lyrics and titles.) Early Chicago house was seen by a lot of American commentators (rightly, more or less) as a cut-rate extension of disco with some added Prince. Pretty quickly, however, as house clubs became as briefly prominent in New York as hip-hop ones, house could not be denied. As with everything-- rock'n'roll, disco, punk, rap-- initially viewed with a cocked eyebrow as a ""fad,"" acid (and house) thrived beyond all expectations. When it hit England, it promptly upended their entirely pop industry for a decade. Today, ""acid"" describes both a moment (the mid-to-late 1980s) and a genre (house music made with the Roland 303 synthesizer). So does this compilation, impeccably timed by Soul Jazz to follow the hipster snout to the next truffle after punk-funk and early 80s electro. (By my estimation we should arrive at Detroit techno before year's end.) People who should know better rag on Soul Jazz, but if you already own all these songs on their original vinyl pressings, this-- despite a generous amount of liner notes and historical material-- isn't for you. But I am guessing you don't. I sure don't. The first acid track is the last one here. Phuture (DJ Pierre, Spanky, Herb, and Marshall Jefferson) created ""Acid Tracks"" in late 1985, holed up in their apartments against the harsh Chi-town winter, abusing a piece of technology that was a commercial flop. The Roland 303 bassline synthesizer sounded so wack when put to its intended use that no self-respecting guitarist would touch it. So it was cheap, and that's how Pierre, Spanky, and Herb got a hold of it. There's a MIDI bleep lurking in the guts of the thing, and when the trio cranked the volume and began twisting the knobs the acid house noise came out. It's kind of hard to describe-- a robot bullfrog imitating a car alarm played on an octave hopping keyboard-- but by now everyone knows it. Jefferson told them to slow it down 10bpm to 120, and showed them how to get it pressed to vinyl. By that point the name had been changed from ""In Your Mind"" to ""Acid Tracks"", as it had colloquially become known as ""Ron Hardy's acid track."" Hardy lorded over the sweat-tippled sardine tin called the Music Box that, along with Frankie Knuckles' Warehouse, was one of house music's two sacred sites. He had played the track on reel-to-reel tape at the Box to ecstatic response, and his kingmaking abilities allowed acid to thrive. As creation myths go, it's a pretty good one. One the one hand, ""Acid Tracks"" is the only acid track anyone really needs. They're all variations on that bassline, essentially. The machine does a lot of the randomization for you: Take the batteries out and there's a whole new bassline waiting for you the next time you turn it on. On the other hand, with the right fingers on the knobs, there's room for endless creative variation. Acid is a strange mix of B-sides and lesser-known tracks with a few classics thrown in, but it still manages to hit most of the major acid tropes. Like the cheesy (in a good way) vocals on opener ""This Is Acid"" by Maurice, which performs the ""rock & roll will never die"" role. (Only when a genre is newborn does it get to name more than 50% of its songs after itself.) ""This is the ultimate acid track."" It's not, really, but it is very charming. Or the spooky narrator of Sleazy D's ""I've Lost Control"", which anthropomorphizes that ""too far gone"" feeling of being nose bleedingly fucked up on cocaine. (Or, uh, so I've heard.) Or the synths running in the background of Mr. Fingers' ""Beyond the Clouds"" that sound like they could be straight off an Erasure record. Or the weird Oompa Loompa chanting on Fresh's ""Dum Dum Pt. 2"". Or the bracingly crude, jacking drum machines powering most of the songs here, drums that can sound like thunderclaps or a child's rock tumbler, often in the same song. But here's the thing. Acid gets a little boring and samey in isolation and repetition. Plus, it's club music. Heard in your living room, I wouldn't blame you for pulling a shrug. Acid can be amazingly powerful, catalytic music, or it can be Eurodisco with funny whub whub noises overtop. So, if early house is still terra incognita, I'd actually suggest starting with last year's amazing (and more wide reaching) Trax Records mix. Or the more catholic *Warp 10+1: Influences comp that came out in 1999 (and includes ""Acid Tracks"".) But if you've already jacked the box once or twice, * *Acid has all the robot bullfrogs and crass drum machines you could ask for. *","Soul Jazz-issued Chicago acid house compilation features pioneers such as Marshall Jefferson, Adonis, Larry Heard, and DJ Pierre.

Out-of-State Plates,Fountains of Wayne,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be065e6ef959693231ae/1:1/w_160/bbd2d986.jpg,2005-06-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3163-out-of-state-plates/,VirginS-Curve,"Think of Out-of-State Plates as a garage-sale effort: Fountains of Wayne rummaged through closets and drawers and came up with about 28 tracks they'd either forgotten about or outgrown, then they put them out for sale. Arrayed on the band's driveway among the piles of National Geographic back issues, that box of old shoes (all left feet, all size 14), and that collection of beer cozies are all the cuts that didn't fit on their three studio albums: the B-sides, oddball covers (ELO! Britney Spears! Burt Bacharach!), fan-only holiday songs, live tracks, even some radio spots. In other words, Out-of-State Plates isn't supposed to be a real album; instead, playing off the commercial success of ""Stacy's Mom"", it's supposed to be mindlessly fun, produce a summer radio single (""Maureen""), and keep the band as close as possible to the forefront of the collective pop-culture conscious. If Out-of-State Plates is about as revelatory as your typical garage sale, it's not because these are necessarily bad songs (except for their lamentable cover of ""...Baby One More Time"")-- it's just that most of them seem somehow defective, one element overpower-popping the others. The bop-bop-ba's that anchor ""Janice's Party"" are more annoying than infectious, revealing how close to whiny Chris Collingwood can come without truly whining. Others try much too hard, with hooks that wheedle their way into your cranium with a carsalesmanly overenthusiasm (""Elevator Up""), and just to switch things up, a few don't try hard enough (""Kid Gloves""). Cumbersome concepts overburden the novelty of ""Karpet King"", ""California Sex Lawyer"", ""Half a Woman"", and the suite of holiday-themed songs, so that they get tangled in their own shoelaces and stumble nowhere in particular. ""Comedienne"" egregiously tries to cast an Elaine Boosler wannabe as a tragic heroine, but to no real avail, although the phrase ""is she killing or dying"" is a nice twist. Fortunately, that humor and wordplay (which reflects the band's debt to country music punnage) does manage to provide a couple of rare bright spots over the course of the compilation's two discs. ""Maureen"", about a friendgirl with overshare issues, makes a nice opener (and a far better single than ""Stacy's Mom""), although if I were cynical I might say the verse about how good the title character looks in a bikini was written expressly for video treatment. Even better is ""The Girl I Can't Forget"", a song whose alcoholic regret (""It's the night I can't remember..."") is goofily tempered by the shock of having it all work out in the end (""...with the girl I can't forget""). The best material here, however, falls to a pair of songs about clever guys dating dumb girls: On ""Baby I've Changed"" a guy begs for forgiveness and promises not to grumble anymore when she wants to hear Sugar Ray, and on ""I'll Do the Driving"", over a pulsing kickdrum rhythm, perhaps the very same guy contemplates his hazy future with a girl who ""has a soft spot for cops who are robots."" The songs would sound mean-spirited were it not for the narrators' off-guard surprise at falling for girls who love ""When It's Over"" and don't know the difference between the Stones and Johnny Cash. While these two lovestruck-dumb doofuses prove there is an intelligent and mischievous personality behind these songs, by commenting on each other's song they also reveal what is perhaps the chief deficiency of Out-of-State Plates: Each of Fountains of Wayne's three albums has its own particular personality, which raises the songs above the status of mere novelty, but Out-of-State Plates, by definition, has none. Its rummaged organization precludes the sort of niceties that benefit their records-- structure, atmosphere, setting, characters, stories, and on and on. As a result, there's no cumulative effect here, which perhaps for some listeners is the attraction: the chance to hear these songs completely divorced of any larger context-- to hear each of them as sovereign singles-- promises another discovery like ""Radiation Vibe"" or ""Denise"". However, this means every song stands alone, even though only a few hold up to that kind of serious-shopper scrutiny.","Two-disc collection of the power-pop band's B-sides, covers, holiday songs, live tracks, and radio spots.

Heartbeeps EP,The Mae Shi,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5620c2bba1b7de0146d/1:1/w_160/d6258492.gif,2005-06-27 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5600-heartbeeps-ep/,5RC,"The Mae Shi's debut LP, a 43-minute album with 33 songs, joined short experiments in both guitar feedback and computerized loops with frenzied, unpredictable rhythms in the tradition of Brainiac and Les Savy Fav. The band threw everything against the wall on Terrorbird, and a few transcendent moments inevitably stuck. With only 10 songs and a runtime of 15 minutes and change, Heartbeeps seems paltry in comparison. Still, the band covers plenty of ground without the the grab-bag diversity or noisy extremes of their earlier work. For a record that lasts only 15 minutes, the pacing is clever. Putting all the two- to three-minute tracks at the end makes them feel epic in comparison to the first half; as soon as you're used to the longer song lengths, the album's over. Songs here are segmented and repeated in the same manner as on Terrorbird. ""Heartbeeps"" appears three times as the album's centerpiece and its bookends. It starts with a few erratic pumps of noise before it finds a pulse on the last track, given two minutes of skittering hi-hats and steady bass to find the melody. Same with ""Spoils of Injury"", 40 seconds of simple electronic beats and simple melody that introduces (but doesn't precede) the droning ""Spoils of Victory"". Compared to the mess of their debut, the puzzle pieces are a little easier to pick up on when there's less of them. The album's second half shifts its gears within each song. ""Crimes of Infancy"" begins with staccato bursts of rhythm before breaking into fluid single-note guitar lines and finishing with windmill-strummed chords. ""Eat the Prize"" contrasts a Jesus Lizard hoedown with weary synthesizers, and ends with a circuitous melody on unaccompanied guitar. ""The Universal Polymath"" covers the most ground most convincingly, from stomping drums to a jagged, bassless melody and ending with a simmering near-freakout. The restraint in these songs goes a long way to proving the band's talents can match their mash-up instincts. It may lack the highs of Terrorbird like ""Power to the Power Bite Two"", but Heartbeeps achieves the same ends faster and more concisely. There's still much untapped potential within this young band, but their gap between proficiency and being merely clever is narrowing.","Hyperproggers cram their short experiments in guitar feedback and computerized loops into a 10-track, 15-minute EP.

Never Let Them Catch You Crying,More Dogs,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35eeb335119a49ed6c0/1:1/w_160/d3db935b.jpg,2005-06-27 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5655-never-let-them-catch-you-crying/,Monitor,"""The end of the album is nigh, maaan."" Grizzled rockwriters and idealistic techno-savants have been waving that apocalyptic placard for years now (sheesh, millennia!). Here's More Dogs, latest tombnail in tow. Seven tracks, 28 minutes: An EP, right? Warm bowl of miso soup, sashimi tray still TK? But these ramshackle Baltimore-based atmosphere-vendors are calling Never Let Them Catch You Crying a full-length, and for once, I'm not gonna argue. What More Dogs' second ahem ell-pee (first for Monitor) lacks in length, it makes up for with big-top instrumentation, Nosferatu organs, rhythmic fakeouts, and mood enough to send noted psychiatry expert Tom Cruise to his meds. Never Let Them is primarily instrumental, aside from the Zombies-like harmony that essentially bookends the album: ""When I think of you I think of sunshine, sunshine."" After those words, the title track fades into the sound of a crackling bonfire or approaching stampede. Both lyrics and, indeed, conventional melodies soon recede behind gloomy/anarchic scene-setting and a tumultuous story arc left largely to the imagination. So, imagine: Second track ""Duty. Duty? Duty."" is a stranger walking in an unknown metropolis, past the waterfront, along rat-infested streets bespattered with pissy puddles. Vibraphones, acoustic guitar, bass and dramatic organ portray a man alone amid urban hurly-burly. On ""Teenage Bunker"", percussion conquers all, clanging and clopping like a gruesome ""Sleigh Ride"" atop a suspenseful, spread-out bass line that soon grows violent. Rockists' friend Mr. Electric Guitar finally grabs a starring role on ""White People"", which during its quiet midsection evokes Radiohead's ""Exit Music (for a Film)"". Watch out, ""Overeater Under Water"" follows with the post-punk card (disco hi-hat!), but the hee-haw bass line and modal guitar sketching still sound equally akin to a Russian folk dance. Disorientation gives way to vivid standout ""March to the Scaffold"", where further horrorshow organ stabs, lunatic percussion and vibraphones conjure up a public spectacle. An execution? Bass murmurs like a milling throng. Then ""This Is the One"" closes the disc in the red, mortally convulsing with feedback and cascading guitar nose. The album is dead; long live... shit.

Clients,The Red Chord,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31fb1335d7bf169865d/1:1/w_160/8b159911.jpg,2005-06-27 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6946-clients/,Metal Blade,"Hailing from Revere, Mass., the Red Chord have spent the past five years or so making a name for themselves as one of the premiere grindcore crossover bands in the country. Their sophomore release, Clients, is a frenzied blast of uncompromising aggression that fuses the chaos, growling vocals and lightening-fast beats of death metal and grindcore with the technical prowess of experimental math- metal and the occasional driving, mid-tempo hardcore rhythm. Frankly, the band seems to be striving to combine just about every genre of heavy music, and for the most part the mix is an overwhelming success. The band is strongest when they're at their most frenetic and unpredictable. The complicated rhythms keep things fresh, as well as setting the Red Chord apart from the thousands of generic grindcore bands out there who rely on speed alone to provide the necessary aggressive backbone. The album's opener, ""Fixation on Plastics"", is 2:44 seconds of blast beats, squealing guitar harmonics, and singer Guy Kozowyk's guttural, inhuman roar. Fueled by drummer Brad Frickeisen, the song shifts gears so rapidly it's almost hard to keep up. Similarly, ""Black Santa"" is unrelenting, offering solid proof that the band's ability to maintain focus at lightening-fast speeds is one of their biggest assets. ""Upper Decker"" throws in a completely unexpected, minute-long bridge about halfway through that combines rumbling drums with atmospheric guitar strumming. It's almost, dare I say, pretty, yet as the song kicks back into high gear, everything gets progressively more intense. The result is one of the album's most powerful moments. When the band strays into more straightforward hardcore territory, the results aren't as positive. ""Lay the Tarp"", for example, begins with a bob-your-head groove that recurs throughout the song, no doubt inspiring testosterone-fueled circle pits whenever it's played live. Even though the song features plenty of the band's breakneck ferocity, it never quite overcomes its own hardcore leanings. ""Antman"" suffers a similar fate, but its high-pitched guitar harmonies and rhythmic guessing-game do keep it from coming across quite as tired. Kozowyk's voice is strong when he stays low and raspy, but when he switches to the spoken/shouted style, it loses so much of its power, going from merciless to meathead in the blink of an eye. Luckily, it's a style he uses very sparingly. The album's most pleasant surprise is the instrumental closing track, ""He Was Dead When I Got There"". By grindcore standards, it's epic, clocking in at almost seven-and-a-half minutes. ""He Was Dead When I Got There"" extends from a long line of melodic thrash instrumentals, occupying the same realm as Metallica's ""Orion"" and Anthrax's ""Intro to Reality"". Nothing else on Clients comes close to this level of delicate musicianship. It's a fine end to a bludgeoning disc, and it proves that The Red Chord is a band that uses their talents to play intricate music at amazing speeds-- not one that uses amazing speeds to cover up a lack of talent.","Sophomore LP from one of the U.S.'s top grindcore crossover bands.

Little Things,Hanne Hukkelberg,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c17a13d197565213bbec/1:1/w_160/e8fea14b.jpg,2005-06-27 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4013-little-things/,Leaf,"After first glance at a partial list of the instruments and found objects used by Hanne Hukkelberg to create her debut album Little Things-- a catalog that includes banjos, accordions, bottlebrushes, bicycle spokes, fiddles, glockenspiel-- you might find yourself bracing for an unruly, discordant mess. Put to practice, however, this homespun assortment of minute individual sound particles is assembled into an astonishingly seamless mosaic over which Hukkelberg crafts her breezily jazzy electronic pop-- the resulting effect of which is something like watching an artisan build a functional wristwatch out of spun glass and raw sugar cane. Little Things was painstakingly arranged and recorded over the course of two years by the 26-year-old Hukkelberg and producer Kåre Vestrheim, who also helmed Shining's In the Kingdom of Kitsch You Will Be a Monster. But despite its meticulous construction, upon casual listen the album can appear to be almost formlessly wispy. Hukkelberg's sparkling, effortlessly likable vocals evoke those of a carefree Lisa Germano, or perhaps a frostier, more tranquil Solex; and draw immediate (if somewhat predictable) comparison to her fellow Norwegians Susanna and the Magical Orchestra. With each song tightly-fitted with miniature, agile machinery, Little Things is an album that best rewards close, undistracted attention, its every delicate tendril capable of sprouting a blossom. Quietly lapping water and gentle strains of Hawaiian pedal steel accompany ""Cast Anchor"", while Hukkelberg celebrates ""not the urge to go somewhere else/ not the urge to blow away/ but the urge for stand still."" On ""Little Girl"" she incorporates playful carnival textures, with jaunty banjo and tuba dovetailing-- perhaps even a bit too pristinely-- into dreamy meadows of ambient electronics. Featuring contributions from various members of Norwegian acts like Shining, Jaga Jazzist, and Kaada, the jazz-inflected playing on Little Things is stellar throughout; although you may wish Hukkelberg and Vestrheim had occasionally allowed things to become more unbuttoned. The woozy Dixieland touches on ""Displaced"" are about as raucous as the album ever gets, though tracks like ""True Love"" and ""Koeft"" do contain some pleasantly chewy bits of languid woodwinds, jazzy guitar and diced Monkish piano. As a songwriter Hukkelberg proves unafraid to do a little strenuous legwork, typically bypassing the easy chorus or turn of phrase in favor of thornier, gradually unwinding melodicism. In so doing, it might seem that she leaves some tantalizingly ripe hooks on the vine on such tracks as the Joni Mitchell-like ""Do Not as I Do"" or the blissful, strolling-accordion closer ""Boble"". Instead she has chosen to gather a harvest more distinctively and peculiarly her own, a decision that sounds more sensible with each subsequent listen.","Breezy, jazzy electronic pop painstakingly arranged by Hukkelberg and Shining producer Kåre Vestrheim.

The Believer 2005 Music Issue CD,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84bea9e61561daa57ae/1:1/w_160/eeaba99e.gif,2005-06-27 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2089-the-believer-2005-music-issue-cd/,The Believer,"If you're not already aware of it, *The Believer is the life partner of Dave Eggers' literary journal * McSweeney's, a monthly collection of essays, reviews, interviews, and somewhat random columns. Populated by the likes of Nick Hornby, Rick Moody, artist Charles Burns, and the occasional Sedaris, it rather quickly and effortlessly assumed the position of periodical meeting place for the young, hip, and literary. Given that we aspire to be all of the above, you might imagine that a lot of Pitchfork staffers are on the subscription rolls of The Believer, and if it didn't cost so much, you'd be right. Nevertheless, the mutual publication love party only goes so far. The Believer planted its flag on the lit-crit scene with an essay by editor-in-chief Heidi Julavits declaring an end to ""snark,"" the practice of being a big mean bully hiding behind a byline and an artsy NYTBR illustration. Pitchfork, of course, is The House that Snark Built, and you'll have to pry the snark out of our Cold. Dead. Haaaaaands. Due to our different territories, these irreconcilable differences aren't a problem 11 months out of the year, but every June an invading party is sent with The Believer Music Issue and its accompanying compact disc supplement. Now if there were ever an example of the narcissism of small differences, it's this; the CD included with the 2004 music issue was like a mix disc predicting our 2004 Top Albums list, featuring as it did folks like the Books, Ted Leo, the Walkmen, and TV on the Radio. This year's installment is likewise packed with Fork-friendly artists, although this time with a twist-- rather than simply throwing together the old previously-released material, The Believer challenges the participants to share the gift of royalties and cover a peer's composition. 'Tis a noble concept, allowing artists to pay rare tribute to contemporaries while keeping them from dusting off that cover of ""Blue Jay Way"" they recorded the night the bass player was too drunk to pluck. On the other hand, the stable of musicians selected for inclusion-- and the material they, in turn, decide to remake-- encapsulates the dullness of this strain of indie, a drab made exponentially stronger by the enforced cross-pollination. For The Believer has a fetish for indie rock that's literate (no duh) and guitar-based, and so we get a collection every bit as singer-songwriter-heavy as Starbuck's music except with a lower profile-- call it independent-coffee-store-down-the-street-from-Starbuck's music. Who else could open a literary journal's music issue compilation than the Decemberists? Covering Joanna Newsom's ""Bridges and Balloons"", Colin Meloy sets the tone for the hour to come by performing it as a one-man acoustical jam, replacing Newsom's Lisa Simpson with his own Professor Frink. It's good; I prefer Newsom's compositions with a little more foundation. Also good on the sim-busking front is The Mountain Goats' cover of the Silver Jews' ""Pet Politics"", about as perfect a musical match as you can find. Other unplugged moments do little to rebut my coffee-shop impressions, such as the Cat Power clone two-fer in the middle (Josephine Foster and Cynthia G. Mason) or somebody named Two Gallants picking up the Neil Diamond worship where Crooked Fingers left off. There's little to write 10-page essays about in terms of full-band performances either, with Spoon absolutely sleepwalking through Yo La Tengo's ""Decora"" (not that somnambulant isn't perhaps the appropriate means of addressing YLT) and the reappearance of the Shins' listless version of the Postal Service's ""We Will Become Silhouettes"". Only a couple tracks stand out as more than novelty and rarities-comp filler: Jim Guthrie's take on the Constantines' ""Nighttime/Anytime (It's Alright)"", which remakes the testosterone-rock of the original as a slow-burn violin funk, and CocoRosie's no-fi reinvention of Damien Jurado's ""Ohio"". Then there's Devendra Banhart taking on Antony & The Johnson's ""Fistful of Love"", which depending on your taste for unique vocal stylings, is either the sound of hell incarnate or a warbly dream come true. So apologies to Snarkwatch, but this collection does little to increase its value beyond free handout. While the concept is noble, the editors would be advised to go with a less one-dimensional roster for next year's issue, to stretch out beyond the tight boundaries of acoustic-folk, freak-folk, and indie pop. A collection of contemporary covers like this one might work with a greater variety of sounds, or at least artists who listen to a greater variety of sounds-- why is the music world covered by The Believer devoid of hip-hop, electronic, or anything not made by (usually acoustic) guitars or the occasional harp? While the magazine is usually adept at pointing people towards wrongfully neglected corners of literature and art, this insular compilation does nothing but point at itself.","Dave Eggers' The Believer invites some of its favorite artists-- including Devendra Banhart, the Mountain Goats, and the Decemberists-- to provide covers of their contemporaries, resulting in a one-dimensional record of acoustic-folk, freak-folk, and indie pop.

The characters nail every tic and whiny habit that we hate in ourselves, from feeling bad about feeling bad, to guilt over privilege, to minor acts of cowardice or selfishness, to the on-again, off-again relationships that wheeze but never die. Remember the scene in Season 3 when Nate Fischer, who can't bring himself to go home to his new wife, pulls over by the side of the road and beats off? Somebody should have won an Emmy for that. And yet every episode offers a few moments that break through the wallowing to show something special and even inspiring, the kind of human moment that you see coming but that you like regardless. And I feel something similar about the setlist of this compilation, the second ""Six Feet Under"" soundtrack: On paper, it spends too much time on commercial, familiar adult pop and too little on edgy rock; in practice, the predictable songs hold up the best. Take Coldplay. I'm as sick of them as the next guy, and actually, I blame television dramas for their overexposure: It seems like every show on the air pulls out ""Trouble"" or ""Clocks"" when the characters have to look extra-introspective, and whenever I hear Chris Martin's voice I think, ""acting crutch."" But on Everything Ends, ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" builds to an easy, reflective climax that leaves room to breathe-- and along with tunes like Phoenix's ""Everything Is Everything"" and ""Amazing Life"" by Jem (who sounds like a flirtier Dido), it rounds off a good dinner party mix. ""Amazing Life"" is the one of four exclusive cuts on the soundtrack, and it's the only one that earned its paycheck. Interpol contributes ""Direction"", a mostly instrumental cut that sounds like between-scene incidental music, and the Caesars cover of ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" stands solidly in the shadow of the original. Meanwhile, the exclusive that has scored the most attention so far is the Arcade Fire's ""Cold Wind"". Arcade Fire are big and they write about dead people, so you can see the brand synergy; but aside from an arch melody, the song seems like a throwaway-- and its ambience is too snowed-in and Win Butler's voice, too Grizzly Adams-like for Six Feet Under's SoCal setting. Everything Ends flows as casually as if the entire Fischer family grabbed a handful of albums for the car, and sometimes the collisions are bizarre-- young Claire's overwraught choice of Radiohead's ""Lucky"", bumps into Irma Thomas' ""Time Is On My Side"", no doubt a childhood fave for matriarch Ruth Fischer. (The only flat-out dud: eight minutes of Death Cab for Cutie's ""Transatlanticism""? Dammit Nate!) Random but cozy, it's a fitting souvenir for the show, especially at the end: If you watch the show enough to remember the song ""Lonely Little Petunia"", you'll love Imogen Heap's brief and eerily spacious rendition, which closes the album on a note that's both bittersweet and creepysweet-- the kind of moment we'll miss after ""Six Feet Under"" is gone.","As the most flawed of HBO's flagship dramas, ""Six Feet Under"" is both the most familiar and most difficult ...

Two years ago, the UK press and sanctimonious U.S. journalists were quick to scoff at America's unwillingness to embrace Electric Six's ""highly ironic"" brand of dick-and-fart-joke rock. The ""indie rock hates fun"" claims made sense for the dismissals of outlandish (but ingenious) acts the Darkness and Junior Senior, but where's the subtle witticism in ""I wanna take you to a gay bar""? Yeah, ""Danger! High Voltage"" was killer, but hardly because of lines like ""Fire in the Taco Bell!"" A lot of things happened to go right for Electric Six on the track, most notably the cautious application of Dick Valentine's grating, class clown vocals. His affected growl may recall Jack Black or Adam Sandler, but what spews from Valentine's mouth is often painfully unfunny-- and downright unlistenable over an entire album. Which is a shame, because Electric Six's revamped guitar/bass/drums lineup oftentimes aims for the same straightforward rock aesthetic as the Hold Steady or Art Brut, albeit with brain-dead rather than merely divisive vocals. As if per some Faustian agreement, Fire struck gold with ""Danger!"" and came up dry on everything else, save for a few commendable stabs at synth pop and dance. Likewise, Señor Smoke flirts with mediocrity on some dancier tracks. ""Dance Epidemic"" dazzles in comparison to its peers, with its libido-driven funk guitar and voluptuous synth bass (think Enon's ""Leave It to Rust"" at a kegger) accounting for roughly 80% of the album's hooks in less than three minutes. The title of ""Dance-A-Thon 2005"" may somewhat falsely advertise, but I'll take its spacey post-grunge bassline and uncharacteristically reserved drumming over the AOR claptrap of their ""Radio Ga Ga"" cover. But enough pussyfootin'-- it's time to address the real shit. This album drops four consecutive hard rock stinkbombs to kick things off, proving Andrew WK has left a mark on the music world. Tongue-in-cheek, head-up-ass ballad ""Jimmy Carter"" gets its jollies referencing presidents (""Like Ronald Reagan falling asleep for ever more,"" yikes!) and quoting the Backstreet Boys. Señor Smoke's saddest aspect, however, is its yearning for another dance-floor single. ""Devil Nights"" and ""Boy or Girl"" got high-hats, synths, and even steal the chords to ""Danger!"", but seem more concerned with cartoon sound effects and lines like ""Hi, welcome to Big Burger, may I take your order?"" You wanna be in a joke band, Dick? Fine, then you're gonna be treated like you're in one.","E6 seem set to do their own version of the ""Fernando Fadeaway.""

Not only are these records roughly comparable in terms of quality, but across any individual album few tracks stand out as failures, just as few are so great they dwarf the music surrounding them. The Mice Parade sound-- a mixture of ringing acoustic guitars layered in Reichian fashion, kinetic drumming, vibes, and assorted non-Western instruments for flavoring-- has in a sense been immune to composition. No matter how Pierce stretches and shapes the pieces, it always sounds like Mice Parade and it always sounds good. Recommending this band to somebody has always been cake: Just pick one of the first five records at random and, if you like it, keep exploring from there. I wouldn't tell them to pick up the sixth album, however. In a sense Bem-Vinda Vontade is easily comparable to its predecessors, with the same instruments beautifully recorded and repetitive songs that swell and contract horizontally rather than using chords to develop. But Bem-Vinda Vontade expands on the use of voice introduced in 2004 on Obrigado Saudade to the point where singing now a centerpiece of the sound. And the vocals, mostly by Pierce and Kristín Anna Valt\xFDsdótti (of Múm), are sure to be divisive. I know Múm's more song-oriented direction has its fans, but for my part Valt\xFDsdótti's singing is completely unlistenable, a tuneless whisper/shriek that seems to exist only as a twee placeholder without having any content on its own. When she comes in on ""Night's Wave"" and ""The Boat Room"" she completely pulls me out of whatever reverie the music inspires. Here is an example of when indie's DIY inclusiveness goes too far. Pierce's singing is spotty but sometimes works. He's only got a few notes to choose from, so the main problem is that pickings are so slim in terms of melody. He duets with Valt\xFDsdótti on ""Night's Wave"" and the music is actually quite good, a thick acoustic stew with furiously strummed guitars, accordion, and Doug Scharin's ever-propulsive drumming, but the actual tune is no match for what surrounds it. But then ""Night's Wave"" ends as Dylan Christie's gorgeous cloud of vibes span the threshold to ""Passing and Galloping"" (as ever, the editing is excellent as one song into the next) and all of a sudden Pierce's vocals fit. The music on ""Passing and Galloping"" is just a shoegazy overdriven guitar atop a bed of endless tom rolls and Pierce's simple vocal lament is an effectively gentle contrast. Nothing wrong with formerly instrumental bands wanting to experiment with songs but it makes sense to recruit singers and songwriters that approach the skill of the music that surrounds them. So much of Bem-Vinda Vontade sounds so nice, with guitar and drum textures as lovely as anything the band has attempted. But the singing seems tacked on and the music suffers, resulting in Mice Parade's least consistent album.","The sixth Mice Parade LP places emphasis on vocals, mostly by Adam Pierce and Kristín Anna Valtýsdótti (Múm).

Yann Tiersen & Shannon Wright,Yann TiersenShannon Wright,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a4ea9e61561daa5887/1:1/w_160/7600254f.gif,2005-06-26 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8297-yann-tiersen-shannon-wright/,Ici d'Ailleurs,"In the United States, French composer Yann Tiersen is best known for his Amélie score, but in France, he's a mainstream sensation who's dabbled in rock, punk, pop, and various works for stage and screen; a popular aesthete whose stark compositions are comparable to those of Erik Satie and Phillip Glass. In the United States, Shannon Wright is best known as the other P.J. Harvey, with a brace of Steve Albini-produced records to show for it, but in France, she's best known for collaborating with Yann Tiersen. If Amélie had been an angsty melodrama about the impossibility of connection rather than a bubbly farce that hinged on implausible connectivity, this collaboration would have served it well. It doesn't seem as if either musician had to bend their aesthetic very far to make it fit. Wright doesn't log as much ragged guitar slashing as she normally does, but her emotionally overstated, depressive whisper/caterwaul is well-matched by the cinematic stateliness and tragic beauty of Tiersen's piano, violin, and accordion arrangements. Insofar as the two halves are extricable, Tiersen's contribution is more compelling. Wright's histrionic singing style and often-mawkish lyrics are an acquired taste, and they impose overly concrete topical borders on Tiersen's evocative, tacitly emotional instrumental tracks. As a result, a music that could have told a thousand stories ends up telling exactly one-- that of Wright's bitter romantic distress. If I'd never heard either artist, I'd be more likely to search out Tiersen's solo work than Wright's. Wright's singing here is particularly reminiscent of P.J. Harvey's Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea, and if you're a fan of either artist, this record's cachet jumps up several notches. It opens with the rumbling, metronomic piano chords and gradually intensifying string accents of ""No Mercy for She"", a dark clockwork dirge trembling on the brink of atonality. ""Dragonfly"" features the wistful accordion that characterized Amélie and scattered echoic guitars. ""Dried Sea"" and ""While You Sleep"" are more rock-oriented, with the haunting arpeggios and studious dissonance of Wright's familiar guitar style weaving through Tiersen's sawing, tempestuous strings. There are some lovely classical piano phrases worked into ""Ode to a Friend"" and ""Callous Sun"", a nice contrast to the more cabaret-style pianos elsewhere. If Tiersen is providing the ballast for Wright's emotional catharsis, then this is the rare case where the ballast is more valuable than the cargo it accompanies.","Collaboration between the eclectic Amélie composer and the bluesy singer-songwriter.

Vol. 5: The Official,Rod Lee,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde513d197565213b64a/1:1/w_160/106a7bf3.gif,2005-06-26 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4985-vol-5-the-official/,Club KingzMorphius Union,"In Baltimore City, Rod Lee is a hitmaker on the level of the Neptunes or Lil Jon-- his productions have helped turn artists such as rapper Bossman and R&B; singer Paula Campbell into local stars. But he's better known as the king of Baltimore club music, a cheap, hard, frantic, fiercely regional strain of black house music that exists only within Baltimore. Baltimore club's closest sonic cousin is probably baile funk-- both rely heavily on unlicensed samples and relentless, virtually amelodic beats. But baile funk is a distant descendent of the frisky, infectious party chants of Miami bass, whereas club comes from the insistent, twitchy minimalism of Detroit and Chicago house. As a result, Baltimore club has a bleak, paranoid edge that baile funk lacks, and the intensely sexual lyrics are in English, not Portuguese, so you can't pretend they aren't nasty. Club music has ruled dancefloors and radio in Baltimore for 15 years, but it remains virtually unheard outside the city-- partly because club producers proudly ignore copyright laws and partly because the music is too damn weird and hard to be considered pop. But blogs like Government Names and tastemaking out-of-town DJs like Diplo and DJ/rupture have given the music a strong internet buzz, and now Lee's label Club Kingz has a distribution deal with Morphius Records, which may well bring Lee's mix CD Vol. 5: The Official to an indie record store near you. The Official is a turgid, overlong, and repetitive mix, with precious few hooks to make the ferocious, concussive breakbeats go down more easily. And yet it also makes a pretty good case that Baltimore club is one of the rawest, most exciting forms of dance music on the planet. A track like DJ Technics' ""The PJ Chant"" starts with a skeletal stomp-clap drum machine and an anthemic horn riff chopped up to sound like a siren, brings in sampled female moans and skittery beatboxing before dropping everything out for a climactic two-note foghorn tuba riff, then builds everything back up into dense, pulsing swirl-- all within two minutes. Lee's own ""Watch My Ass"" lays a shuffling, rattling drum break under Lady Margetta's cold, unemotional X-rated vocal (""Watch my ass as I'm grindin' on ya dick, daddy""), then multitracks and layers Margetta's vocal until it becomes a part of the beat itself. KW-Griff's ""The Problem"" speeds up the eerie horror-movie pianos from Lil Scrappy's ""No Problem"" to cartoonish velocities, adding goofy whizzing sound effects and an uproarious sampled burp to the mix. It all adds up into a bruising, mind-warping monolith. But every once in a while, something painfully human jumps out of the stew. Lee's ""Luvin' You"" supports a crushingly sad vocal from the R&B; group Status with an uncharacteristically twerky, infectious Green Velvet-ish old-school house track. Nigga Say What's ""Horn Theme"" combines an obliteratingly huge horn riff with an epic, apocalyptic choir to stunning effect. And on ""Dance My Pain Away"", Lee's unpolished, atonal vocals tell a tale of financial stress (""Listen to my story/ Bill collectors on me/ Have to file bankruptcy"") before building to triumphant chorus: ""I'm gonna dance my pain away."" It's not only a great track; it's an explanation of how a furious, urgent, unforgiving mutation of house music captured a poor, dangerous city.","Latest set from the king of Baltimore club music.

Army of Me: Remixes and Covers,Various Artists,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ccc0084474cd0c0114/1:1/w_160/17ee3905.gif,2005-06-23 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/738-army-of-me-remixes-and-covers/,One Little Indian,"With its wormy techno propulsion and bruising hip-hop drums, ""Army of Me"" kicked off Post with a snarling menace in 1995. Ten years on, the popular favorite is obliterated, rethought, and generally mangled on this 20-track charity record. Compiled by Björk and ""Army"" co-writer Graham Massey, the schizophrenic disc features a slew of little-known acts from around the globe handpicked from hundreds of fan submissions. Though it must have been a beast of a task to whittle down the contenders to just 20, a more suitable 10 would have infinitely improved this often tedious exercise in song deconstruction. Even at its most misguided, the album's diversity is astounding-- a fitting tribute to Björk's universality. I'll never forget the last time I saw her perform at a minor league baseball stadium in Brooklyn two years ago: To my left a 60-something grandma with her daughter, straight ahead a Latino family so touched by their hero they could barely look at her in between joyous sobs (it was a little creepy-- but poignant), and behind me a beyond-pale German inexplicably looking like a bespectacled, well-tailored Dickens character in the dead of summer. The same unlikely juxtapositions are inherent on Army of Me but each cover or remix's execution often saps the defiant energy out of its source material. Playing into the common cover-album blueprint, we get a token country translation from the Brixton-based Messengers of God, a slinky lounge version courtesy of France's Grisbi, three (too many) hard rock takes, and an accordion-only prank that basically defines the term ""novelty cover."" Even relative superstar Patrick Wolf (often hyped as ""Björk as a boy"") misfires with an utterly self-serious remix mired in arch industrialism. Obviously, Björk is not the easiest singer to emulate, so the medal-bearers in this Army wisely embody her keen sense of abstract exhibitionism instead of her physical gifts. London-based harpist Tom Moth spearheads the group Lunamoth, who turn in a beyond creepy spine-tingler perfect for a David Lynch film or slow, poetic death under the eyes of a particularly bleak twilight. The group's choice to back their female, spoken-word reading with a heavily-effected, voices-in-the-head intercom echo eerily captures the internal struggle for self-sufficiency Björk yearns for. Danish group Atoi give the bombastic track a subtle and genuine Vespertine-style redux, with girlish vocals playing off blippy microsounds that pit and patter inside some igloo paradise. Two danceclub-ready tracks blissfully capture the original's beat-based funkiness in very different ways. Germany's Beats Beyond remix the track by backing Björk's vocals with a distorted four-four crunch that recalls the whipping precision of fellow countrymen Alter Ego and their smash ""Rocker"". Seventeen-year-old Swede Tor Bruce strays from Ms. B's punishing sentiments entirely and bubbles-up with a ping-ponging happy-time anthem that could easily double as winner's circle music for any Mario Kart game. It's a throwaway for sure, but in the most delightful way possible, which, unfortunately, can't be said for the majority of this mostly middling, sometimes excruciating collection.","With its wormy techno propulsion and bruising hip-hop drums, ""Army of Me"" kicked off Post with a snarling menace in ...*

The Heartlight Set,Joy Zipper,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2e5e6ef95969322b34/1:1/w_160/b10d8192.jpg,2005-06-23 06:00:08,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4304-the-heartlight-set/,Mercury,"""Heartlight,"" whatever that may be, has lent its name to a personal favorite young adult science-fantasy novel by T.A. Barron, a Marion Zimmer Bradley witch-story paperback I came across three minutes ago on Amazon, and of course, the rousing Diamond/Bacharach pop song. It makes sense that Joy Zipper would adopt the phrase, given their obvious debt to My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, the phosphorescent pink glow of which come closest to sonically approximating its compelling image. On The Heartlight Set, Long Island duo Vinny Cafiso and Tabitha Tindale continue to let that oneironautic influence shine in a greasy rainbow alongside Stereolab and the omnipresent Pet Sounds. At the outset, Joy Zipper's latest looks to augur a slight shift. First track ""Go Tell the World"" all but sends up the band's frequent White Stripes comparisons (y'know, 'cause they're a couple) with Tindale's talky, blues-based vocals calling out over a swinging drum beat. Shortly, though, the typical swirly Shields-isms snuff the budding retro-rock in familiar shoegaze-era production values. The Belle & Sebastian pop of ""Anything You Sent"" is another exception, veering dangerously close at the chorus to the ""come on, come on and dance all night"" section of Lovin' Spoonful's ""Summer in the City"". By the record's end, songs like horn-lightened ""World Doesn't Care"", catchy yet endlessly repetitive ""Rockdove"", and diaphanous, immersive finale ""Holy Driver"" return to the band's status quo. In their sonic appropriations, Joy Zipper most resemble Snow Patrol's polished Final Straw. Indeed, first single ""You're So Good"" has Tindale and Cafiso both sounding notably Lightbody-esque over simple, crunching guitars, and the lyrics share Lightbody's intra-relationship emotional space without his string-yanking specificity. Forthcoming single ""1"" is a catchy gray spot, laying Cafiso's unspectacular love poetry (""you're the one"") atop one of the recycled chord progressions that allowed 90s alt-rock radio to exist. A fizzy guitar lead during instrumental bits jumps straight out of the solo in Weezer's ""Across the Sea"", but the words are more Green Album. My childhood Heartlight involved vast galactic struggles worthy of L'Engle, if not Lucas or, humph, Dubya. Joy Zipper's meticulous dream-pop is, similarly, in the realm of the tesseract-enabling science fantasy, but its emotional palette ranges mostly between kinda-melancholy (""Thoughts a Waste of Time"") and sorta-happy (""What You Want""-esque ""Window""). OK, there's also the incongruously tawdry ""For Lenny's Own Pleasure"" (that's Bruce, natch). No Diamond, though.","Long Island duo Vinny Cafiso and Tabitha Tindale return with another LP of dream pop.

Constantly Terrified,Hair Police,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c15c13d197565213bbb9/1:1/w_160/3f49ddeb.jpg,2005-06-23 06:00:07,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3984-constantly-terrified/,Troubleman Unlimited,"It's Horror Show Suspense Building 101: the less an audience actually sees of the monster, the scarier it becomes. The more your creature can remain concealed in the murky shadows just slightly off-camera, the longer you're able to distract from the fact that it's really just some bozo stagehand in a rubber mask. This would appear to be a lesson well absorbed by the three noise-rock magi of Hair Police on Constantly Terrified, the latest ghoulish onslaught in the group's rapidly expanding discography. On this album's four lengthy tracks, the trio of guitarist/vocalist Mike Connelly, percussionist Trevor Tremaine, and electrician Robert Beatty make more judicious use of unadulterated squalling cacophony than on past releases like 2002's Blow Out Your Blood or 2004's Obedience Cuts. Here instead they place further discomfiting emphasis on clammy gooseflesh atmospherics while reserving their purest jolts of battery-acid intensity for those crucial moments that will inflict maximum listener trauma. Hair Police make most skillful use of this dramatic modulation on the opening ""Rattlers Echo"", a craftily brutal track that originally appeared on a 3"" CD-R from the Chondritic Sound label. Belly-crawling beneath the acrid smoke of pulsing guitar, cutlery-rattling percussion and ominous, animal-- like electronic cries, the three achieve visceral, almost unbearable heights of tension before (spoiler alert!) finally letting loose just around the four-minute mark with a blindsiding ambush of wild, inhuman ferocity. During the subsequent flesh-eating bacchanalia, the group's oft-noted debts to such noisy predecessors as Harry Pussy, Hanatarash, or Whitehouse become readily apparent. Impressive though this unmerciful maelstrom is, Hair Police extend the scene an unnecessary minute or two, and the track's furious, concentrated assault begins to crumble upon prolonged exposure to the sunlight. Following this comes ""The Haunting"", a sweaty, throbbing wall of Hammer Films signifiers that joins faraway, disembodied shrieks to lurching, haunted castle groans and swirls of dry ice fog. Dense with feedback and untraceable electronic spirits, this piece amplifies the album's unsettling, claustrophobic mood, a gloom that is never lifted or resolved as the listener is instead forced to simmer in the trio's sickly vapors. This grim, faceless unease also permeates the set-closing title track, a 13-minute epic that stands as Hair Police's most finely-grained recording to date. Featuring unruly saxophone contributions from Wolf Eyes' John Olson, this piece seamlessly weaves between free-form BYG-Actuel jazz, dental drill electronics, and exaggerated, ungainly art-rock gestures. A fitting close to this morbidly addictive and compelling album, on this track Hair Police-- as with the sinister swinging pendulum on the album's cover-- wreak the most damage not through violent assault, but in the dreadful anticipation of the possible blows to come.","Over four lengthy tracks, the trio make more judicious use of unadulterated squalling cacophony than on past releases.

Variations on a Theme,Om,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45e5e6ef95969323a40/1:1/w_160/cb01a7b5.jpg,2005-06-23 06:00:06,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6115-variations-on-a-theme/,Holy Mountain,"A moment ago there was a thunderclap outside my window. Now I'm spying sludgy, black clouds. The sun/storm transition and the promised precipitation presents a great setting for Om's Variations on a Theme, a heavy, diligently pure collection of stoned riffs focused on a Blakean skyward freedom quest. Over the past few months, fans of stoic repetition have been feasting on new (or reissued) works by Earth, Sunn0))), and Orthrelm, among others. During this period of drone-made-flesh, Om's Variations on a Theme was released and has since served as one of my steadiest musical companions. It admittedly took a while for me to turn my appreciation into words, and by now it's already common enough knowledge that craggy toothed ex-Sleep guitarist Matt Pike joined forces with drummer Des Kensel and the inimitable low-ender Joe Preston in the unabashedly rockist High On Fire. Around the time Blessed Black Wings came out, Sleep's other two-thirds, the locked-groove rhythm section of bassist/vocalist Al Cisneros and drummer Chris Hakius, resurfaced as Om. Om retains more of the Sleep vibe than High On Fire, essentially continuing along the lines of the Sabbathian one-track, 52-minute opus pocus Jerusalem (and its subsequent rebirth as the lenghtier, re-masted original Jerusalem demo recording, Dopesmoker), but with a tighter, jauntier step. Cisneros and Hakius don't bother replacing Pike with a new set of six strings: The two go it sans guitar and get even closer to the essence of Sleep's raison d'\xEAtre. Gone also are the hempy lyrics à la Jerusalem's ""Drop out of life with bong in hand/ Follow the smoke toward the riff filled land."" I did a fairly close reading of the accompanying words (sung like Sabbath mantra) and the closest linkage I could find was ""seed."" The aforementioned theme of flight is instead evoked via stately salvos like ""to sun glides the albatross,"" ""the flight to freedom gradient raise the called ascendant,"" ""I climb toward the sun to breath the universal,"" etc. God bless, Homer and all of this friends... But whatever the pot percentage, the three gargantuan tracks clock in at 21:18 (""On The Mountain at Dawn""), 11:56 (""Kapila's Theme""), and 11:54 (""Annapurna"") respectively, and the repetitious riffs flow plentiful. Variations on a Theme is the ideal title: ""On The Mountain At Dawn"" sets the pace, ""Kapila's Theme"" slows it down and allows more space for tonal resonance (and a ""blue stoned moon"") as the protagonist walks toward a mountain and the horizon, and the climactic ""Annapurna"" shifts into more upbeat drumming (fills dart beside the cymbal) and crescendo. It's a buoyant resolution with lyrics that repeat time again until the final intonation of our High Priest: ""Lazarus advance the flight to freedom."" Amen. This is niche listening: If you dig the aforementioned bands, this is up your sleeve. If you're concerned with resolution, while Variations on a Theme is hypnotic (and even catchy), it might not satisfy certain cravings: Icarus caught in sustained holding pattern, resulting in slow-release revelation rather than precipitous meltdown. Watch that fucker soar.","A collection of heavy stoned riffs and stoic repetition.

Fallow Field,The Old Haunts,by: Stephen M.

The album draws on tracks from their two eponymous EPs and supplements them with newer material, and the seams show: There are three different lineups playing on the album-- mainstays Craig Extine and Scott Seckington and three different drummersÑand Fallow Field is a hodgepodge, albeit a self-conscious one: As one drummer replaces another, the sound changes noticeably, becoming less confident and distinct as the band struggles to find a comfortable balance of jerky rhythms, garage riffs, sludgy low end, and dark, often defiant lyrics. Recorded last year, the first six songs are the most recent, with Danny Sasaki of Mocket on drums. His tight, metronomic beats propel the riffs, keeping the songs reined in but allowing the band to make full use of the short running times. At just under two minutes, ""Poison Control"" is a quick burst of agitated guitars, but tracks like ""Clubs as Boots"" draw out longer, with Extine howling his fears like Tom Verlaine and Seckington switching between muddy guitar and percolating bass. As ""Deflect It"" nears its end, Extine shreds the melody to tatters as the rhythm section stoically chugs along. ""It's So Scandalous"" jitters like the DTs, airing its paranoia in tempo changes and Sasaki's revving-motor beats. After six songs, Natalie Cox, late of Popular Music, replaces Sasaki behind the drums for a run of four tracks that were recorded in 2002, and the switch is immediately obvious. Letting Extine's guitar and Seckington's complicated bass line lead the way, she rides her high hat throughout the songs, but the real change is in range and instrumentation. Leaving behind the tight, spare punk of the first songs, ""The Old World"" adds piano and organ to the mix, creating a fuller, more dramatic sound to match the song's gravity. Perhaps the album's outstanding track, it's a quiet hymn to regret and resistance that ends with stark self-loathing: ""If I had known what I know now I would have never left this life so slow,"" Extine seethes. ""I was getting old, a child that's grown cold/I shut my mouth and did as I was told."" Even when those ancillary instruments fall away, ""Gold Light"" still seems larger in scope and sound than the first section, albeit not as elemental. But the tempos slow to a trudge on ""Cult Baby"", and Cox's section of the album loses steam on her final song, ""You Could Never Know"", although this may be due as much to Extine's declining songwriting as to her drumming. For the final two songs, which were recorded in 2003, Chris Sutton of Dub Narcotic Sound System replaces Cox behind the kit. His drumming is harder and punchier, making ""Out of Sight"" and ""Vandal Hymn"" sound rawer and more aggressive than anything that precedes them. The section has the feel of an encore, as if recorded live in some smoky club, but it lacks the immediacy of the album's portion of the album and the drama of the second. If you can unspool the tangled chronology of Fallow Field, you'll discover a band in the process of finding itself, arriving at the point near where the album starts-- since these tracks were recorded, Curtis Phillips has taken over the kit from Sasaki, so who knows which of these three incarnations is most representative. ","This debut LP draws on tracks from the band's two eponymous EPs.

Wilderness,Wilderness,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2075e6ef9596932030c/1:1/w_160/28cf61ea.jpg,2005-06-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8791-wilderness/,Jagjaguwar,"Every few years, there's a trend among bandnames, a recurring word or theme that hits the underground's collective consciousness like a slap on the forehead, only to saturate record shelves and concert bills to the point of parody. For British alternapop groups in the early 90s, Jesus saved, while those bearing giddy power-pop later in the decade were invariably dubbed ""super."" Lately, there's been an influx of repetition (Xiu Xiu, Man Man, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and ""black"" bands (Black Dice, Black Keys, Black Eyes, Black Mountain), but increasingly, groups find themselves indebted to creatures of nature (Gorillaz, Deerhoof, Doves, Caribou, Pelican), and particularly wolves. So in a period during which the animal kingdom permeates the independent aesthetic, it's hard not to admire the band that takes a big-picture approach: Welcome to the Wilderness. Formed three years ago in Baltimore, a city increasingly known for its thriving club music community, the art-rock four-piece builds off the history of pre-adolescent post-rock-- not the academic jazz-inflected instrumentals or orchestral crescendos associated with the genre today, but rather post-rock as defined in the early 90s by music journalist Simon Reynolds, a scene in which bands like Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis, and Disco Inferno applied guitars more for their aqueous, saturated textures and tones than for rigid pop structures. Like those bands, Wilderness deploy spacial, dream-like atmospheres and ominous ethereality over cymbals that shimmer and splash against tom-heavy drum patterns. Brooding, artstruck guitars ring out from the depths, echoing the swirling neo-psych of Echo and the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes. But when frontman James Johnson breaks like headlights through the mist, the picture shifts from bliss-out watercolor to black-streaked oil canvas: Channeling the primal weirdness of a young David Byrne, or the unhinged proclamations of Public Image Ltd's John Lydon, his words are more announced than sung, and like a number of Eno-era Talking Heads tracks, he often relies on distinctive sing/speak cadences in lieu of tightly structured vocal melodies. Rising, falling, and lifting again, Johnson's silvery howl rides the band's iridescent, rainswept instrumentation like a cresting tide, obscuring lyrics that alternate between abstract expressionism and fatalistic, anti-political rhetoric. It's a fantastic technique, but also a risky one: On cursory listens, many listeners could find the album beautifully lush-- even pioneering-- yet still be somewhat put off by the seeming atonality of Johnson's unusual style. But that's where the pleasant surprise lies: As these songs begin to settle in deeper, his vocal topography unexpectedly yields tons of melody where there initially may have seemed to be very little. Kicking in with an authoritative snare, a pause, and an explosive combination of smashed cymbal, walking bass, and stratospheric guitarwork, ""Marginal Over"" brightly broadcasts Wilderness' arrival, but it doesn't take long for things to turn darker: The doom-stricken ""Arkless"" lies at the heels of the opener, and just around the corner from that is one of the album's greatest-- and gravest-- standouts, the urgent, desolate ""End of Freedom"", which finds Johnson at his most animated and desperate, insistently commanding ""the hand over the fist."" Later, in ""Fly Further to See"", the band ascends from the murk, emerging with triumph and radiant guitar lines, before closing out the record with the experimental solo piano piece ""Mirrored Palm"". Of course, while Wilderness are certainly unique, and prove themselves dynamic within their own strict parameters, a bit more variety wouldn't hurt, nor would more of the kind of melodic infusion found at the apex of ""End of Freedom"". But considering the original sound they've created-- and at such an early stage of their career-- it's difficult to find too much fault: Even given this level of sonic consistency, the album only drags once, briefly, during the eight-minute centerpiece ""Post Plethoric Rhetoric""-- and that's at the beginning, before the track manages to get fully off the ground. What Wilderness really seem to signify-- and what makes them important-- is a shift back towards the more cerebral end of the rock spectrum. Every extreme has its antidote, and just as it's been rewarding to see artists loosen up, enjoy themselves, and have some fun for once, it's also refreshing to hear them aspiring, just as passionately, to music of a more serious persuasion. In an environment that's reveled so long in the comfortability of tradition and flavor-of-the-month transitiveness, this kind of substantive art-rock is ripe for exploration. If Wilderness aren't quite kings of the mountain yet, it might just be that few others have yet traversed their fertile domain. ","On their debut for the celebrated Jagjaguwar label, this Baltimore four-piece deploys spacial, dream-like atmospheres and ominous ethereality over ride cymbals, tom-heavy drum patterns, and brooding, artstruck guitars that echo the swirling neo-psych of early-80s heroes Echo and the Bunnymen, the Teardrop Explodes, or vintage 4AD artists.

One minute someone's whispering ""meow, kitty"" over abrasive squalls of guitar; the next, they sound like Queens of the Stone Age.

Along with its diversity, it's the album's brevity that makes it so palatable-- it's attack one idea, get out, and go on to the next. ""Mud Puppies"" swings its stoner-rock riff like a mace behind ghostly chorus singers before dropping into industrial drones halfway through. If you're not watching, you'll probably miss the noise bleeding into ""Inner Child Abuse"", led by Hill's tight improvised pummeling on drums, which then railroad the transition into the ghoulish organ and corrosive guitar squeals of ""The Smoking Man Returns"". ""Rock Weird (Weird Rock)"", runs through scales over a stilted zombie march while a robotic voice chants ""weird rock, weird rock, weird rock, weird rock, rock weird, rock weird..."" (and I know, because they were thorough enough to transcribe those lyrics in the booklet. Thanks a shitload, guys.) The manipulated vocals continue through the perky folk strumming of ""Mashed"", then a announcer with a southern accent introduces the gothic surf rock of the title track. ""No Umbrellas"", one of only two songs with normal, unmolested vocals, moves through supercharged proto-punk guitar riffs with one-finger piano and handclaps, recalling the playful best of QOTSA. After all that, the traditional lift-yr-lighter closing ballad ""Apartment 31"" is somehow the strangest of the bunch. The musicians of Goon Moon have made listenable record, while clearly unconcerned who listens to it. For fans of both indie and psychedelic rock, there's some reward, but the straddling of that line seems purely incidental. It's a short, strange trip, but it sounds like it was fun as hell to make and doesn't aim for anything more. Consider it the lighter side of indulgence from three talented and bizarre musicians.","Collaboration between Twiggy Ramirez, Hella's Zach Hill, and Chris Goss (Masters of Reality).

Such Triumph,The Narrator,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96cc0084474cd0c25e4/1:1/w_160/fc90364a.jpg,2005-06-22 06:00:10,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5896-such-triumph/,Flameshovel,"It was just a little over a year ago that Nick Sylvester, on this very bandwidth, mused upon the contrast between the Narrator's life-threatening live show and the unfulfilled potential of their Youth City Fire EP. They were a fairly new band, and seemed to be caught between the opposing poles of simpering emo and earsplitting turbo-punk. Such wavering is a severe liability for the EP's shortened format, which requires front-to-back head shots-- all kill no fill. But whatever indecision plagued the Youth City Fire EP has mostly filtered out of the Narrator's audio onslaught in the course of the intervening year: After the feedback-laden madrigal that comprises the first minute-and-a-half of their debut full-length, the album proper begins with the bang of diesel-fueled chordage, careening drums and brazen shout-along vocals. The Narrator proceeds to subject their riffs and rhythms to a series of spectacular secret grips that hardly relents until the humming dronefest that closes the record, ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS"". A combination of serrated texture and breakneck intensity is what makes this fairly conventional album stand out: Instead of the shock of the new, it imparts the shock of the awesome, as it's tough to reinvent a wheel that's jamming down a rutted road with redlining RPMs. The violence is pyrotechnically garish, and one pictures bending guitar necks, snapping strings, toppling cymbals, sparking and smoking amps, a sky full of fireworks. For those who miss Up-era Modest Mouse, with their concussive riffs, prickly harmonics, and canting string-bends, Such Triumph will give you a lot to think about on your next long drive. ""Erase the sound!"" the singer sneers at the start of ""Pregnant Boys"", leaping headlong into a total ""Shit Luck"" lead (note-note-bend, note-note-bend) before the song levels out into a more muscled riff, flexing through unkempt intensity shifts. ""Ergot Blues"" is a Hot Snakes-style, no-bullshit rave-up that showcases the singer's newfound confidence by putting the vocals high in the mix. The skittering riff on ""Roughhousing"" hits the sweet spot, and ""Now is the Time for All Good Men"" lays a staccato telegraph atop tightly coiled melodic lead for a potent hitch-and-glide contrast. ""Wait No Actually"" and ""Wolves in the Walls"" are slower numbers that break the momentum in a way that's undesirable, but these feel like vestiges of a former identity crises. Instead of working out the kinks, the Narrator is working them in, and if their next record happens to feature even knottier guitars and more dangerous rhythms, that'd suit me fine.","A combination of serrated textures and breakneck intensity make this a step up from their recent EP.

"Não Wave: Brazil Post Punk 1982-1988 / The Sexual Life of the Savages: Underground Post-Punk in São Paulo, Brasil",Various Artists,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a849ea9e61561daa57a7/1:1/w_160/df70dc86.jpg,2005-06-22 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11713-nao-wave-brazil-post-punk-1982-1988-the-sexual-life-of-the-savages-underground-post-punk-in-sao-paulo-brasil/,Man,"Two collections of this Brazilian post-punk appear during the same month, and it seems almost like someone just made it up, like the punchline to a joke about music elitists-- ""These days I'm mostly into Brazilian post-punk."" Then again, the reissue cottage industry has thrived on tracing the way familiar Western genres were circulated and re-imagined across the rest of the planet. Garage and punk could offer a DIY template for Japanese or Indian kids to get moving; psychedelic rock could swim out to Turkey and Thailand and collide with the ""exotic"" sounds it was already imitating; even the instant-globalism of dance music is constantly spitting out regional variants, from Israeli trance to baile funk. And, as baile funk demonstrates, Brazil is a natural for mixing a variety of sounds, with a seriously musical culture that's already built on a constantly-shifting amalgam of influences -- African, Iberian, indigenous, ""Western."" The decades leading up to this music saw the country swing from idealistic technocracy to military dictatorship and back, from national feuds about the electric guitar's corruption of domestic pop to centralized national-culture projects to apparent freedom-- what better moment for this stuff to land? The thrill, with this sort of thing, is always in the freshness of the results, and there's plenty of that on display in these two compilations-- from ultra-energetic funk on Sexual Life to the synth experiments of São Paulo goths on Não Wave. It'd be sheer cultural projection to imagine that the bands behind these tracks, outside of our Western limelight, just magically felt free to cut loose and let the creative urges flow; the politicization of Brazilian music goes at least as far back and the splits between Tom Jobim and Nara Leão, and I'd be willing to bet than in São Paulo, 1983, as anywhere else, there were kids in the back of the club bitching about how Agentss were totally five minutes ago. No, the freedom here is something else, and anyone expecting to hear the post-punk template meshing with Carnivalesque samba and the old violão will be mildly disappointed. The main difference is this: While the Western acts we'll compare these tracks to put a lot of energy into keeping fierce and conjuring up gloom, their Brazilian counterparts don't necessarily share that agenda. With the best of these artists, it seems like a lot of the template crossed the ocean as nothing more than a stylish, compelling sound-- something that could just as easily be attacked with a lot more joy and warmth. Each compilation has similar estimations of who that ""best of these artists"" might refer to-- only three tracks actually overlap between them, but there's not much contention over the core acts. As Mercenarias were a spiky girl-group whose analogs (Slits, Liliput, Au Pairs) leave them sounding particularly accessible today; Sexual Life kicks off with two of their tracks, while Não Wave makes room for a one-minute rant. Then there's Akira S et as Garotas que Erraram, whose sound is accessible in a more surprising way, so effortlessly of-the-moment that piling on the references doesn't really help. (""Sobre as Pernas,"" on both discs, sounds to these ears like the dour early funk of A Certain Ratio meeting the hustling bass and synth wash of A Flock of Seagulls.) Fellini, smaller in scale but bigger in oddity, manage to score two cuts on each set, with a sparser pop/rock sound- -""Rock Europeu"" jangles confidently, but elsewhere it's minimal, drum-machined pop with a curious bedroom-built sound. And the two comps also share their rock-out moment, with a jaw-dropping entry from Muzak: ""Ilha Urbana"" is dark and quite casually fierce, with patterns of guitar noise shaping up and accelerating like This Heat or Bauhaus. The differences between the discs are partly curatorial, and partly in the vibe built up around the bits they share. Sexual Life doubles up tracks on key artists-- Chance, Akira S, Smack, others-- and feels mixed for continuity: It kicks off with its most accessible pop and then swings, as befits a Soul Jazz product, into a midsection that piles on the funk. This is where the expected Brazilian touches come through, and where the genre splits off into something all its own. The complex polyrhythms and spazzed-out dance moves build their way to incredible levels of energy. One track's overhyped bounce and showy guitar solos sound almost like L.A. funk-metal, another offers post-disco party chants, others hustle and grind like Public Image Limited. With Patife and Gueto and Nau, percussion goes nuts, song structures hit metal-like levels of instrumental interplay, and the vocals shout to follow. Whereas Não Wave coasts along in a vaguely more European pop mold. A band like Black Future might let out a little of that dark, bouncing funk, but for the most part these acts keep their hair stylish and their armpits dry; by the end, Voluntários de Pátria are borrowing XTC's ""Making Plans for Nigel"" riff for a loopy two-minute strut. This disc's center, in fact, exposes a vibe that just might be the polar opposite of Sexual Life's-- edgy, stylish new-wave and moody, synth-assisted excursions for the São Paulo goths. Azul 29 sound more like Fad Gadget or Soft Cell than any guitar band, and Chance's sleepy ""Samba do Morro"". while on both discs, sounds more at home here. Bands like AKT and Ira! build up plenty of motion, but their particular sounds have more in common with the airy edges of Wire or Swell Maps or Siouxsie and the Banshees than the gut-level flash of Sexual Life's selection. Still, anyone overly struck by the difference in tone might just be reacting to the psychological spillover of the packaging-- vivid, jaunty yellow for Soul Jazz, classic black for Man Recordings, the German label issuing Não Wave. The bridges between the two are obvious enough, and it's a happy coincidence that they'd both appear at the same time. Both, really, get to offer something fairly splendid: Newly exhumed reissues that don't feel as if too much of their value is wrapped up in archival curiosity or music-elite tourism. Half of the fun with the standard post-punk canon is tracing out all the directions the anything-goes aesthetic had bands moving. These days, with ""post-punk"" narrowing down to describe a pretty rigid sphere, it's a treat to hear how that anything-goes worked somewhere else-- with a selection of tracks as exciting as any English reissue you might dig up.","This pair of compilations-- one each from Soul Jazz and Man Recordings-- explores 1980s Brazilian post-punk.

1,Eyeball Skeleton,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15eea9e61561daa47a8/1:1/w_160/138d3dd5.jpg,2005-06-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2930-1/,My Pal God,"#1 is the My Pal God debut for Eyeball Skeleton, which features gradeschoolers JJ and Charlie Brown rocking the bass, guitar, and vocals with a drum machine and guitar assist from their dad. Gimmick? Ah, maybe. But if you put rags in your ears it sounds a little like the Coachwhips. Eyeball Skeleton's songs nick little pieces of rock history's past 30 or so years, hashing out enough of a guitar line or melody to support JJ and Charlie's antsy gang vocals. Run the water while listening to the instrumental ""Redfish"" and it's Electr-O-Pura-era Yo La Tengo covering Dinosaur Jr.'s ""Start Choppin'"". ""The Bouncing Apes"" picks out what's essentially an indie pop progression. Still, the song's really just a reason to make a truckload of goofy monkey noises, and there's nothing wrong with that. Throughout #1 JJ and Charlie sing as if they absolutely cannot wait to get to the next lyric. But give our junior achievers a break-- you'd be excited too if your next line rhymed ""really spooky"" with ""kind of pooky."" That line's from ""Spooky Mummy Case"", a trash-rock ditty with a name you can just see oozing down your projection screen TV in bulbous Hanna-Barbera orange. A madcap pace, ancient runes, disembodied mummy sound effects-- ""Mummy Case"" is a better remake of the Scooby-Doo cartoons than anything starring Matthew Lillard and a CG pooch. Some assembly has certainly been required for Eyeball Skeleton. The nine songs on this debut are simplistic, even rudimentary. But they're also crafty with a hook, and use every single trick of the lo-fi recording trade-- scraggly electric guitars matched by a generic drum machine beats, using the space underneath a faltering vocal to add character and depth, releasing #1 on an pedigreed indie. So it's likely Bill Brown, JJ and Charlie's dad, deserves a hand. Hearing that, some will again point to the half-deflated Mylar gimmickry balloon. Yes, as if Eyeball Skeleton's trajectory from living room performances to local college radio sensations to gigs on ""Pancake Mountain"" to sharing roster space with Drums & Tuba and French Kicks just has to be some sort of indie rock cashflow conspiracy. Right. Because that's how evil geniuses with big glasses and tight T-shirts spend their time. Of course Brown helped his sons out with arrangements-- they aren't even old enough to buy Rated T video games. Clamors for validity aside, #1 is a pleasant summertime lark. And if that's all it is, then that's all it is. The title track's muddy riff (it's slowed-down from vintage DC hardcore) is the perfect frame for JJ and Charlie's layered harmonies, and their lyrics about skeletons on bicycles and boogey men are more charming than an entire platoon of lovelorn twee-pop charm police. At the very least their ""Flat Top Vampire"" will be the jam at your local iPod shuffle night.","On their My Pal God debut, this gradeschool band rocks out with their dad.

Where's Black Ben?,Need New Body,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3bc69fc7814a47cd6fd/1:1/w_160/97248628.jpg,2005-06-21 06:00:18,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5734-wheres-black-ben/,5RC,"Last month I saw Need New Body open for the Hold Steady on an exceedingly strange bill for New York, a city of typically cohesion-minded clubs. NNB played a long, noodly set that had me going, ""c'mon, man,"" but also, ""wow, that drummer's good,"" and, ""I hope my girlfriend, who clambered here on a sprained ankle, doesn't kill me."" The crowd tolerated opener Brother Ali-- the First Cracker of Minneapolis hip-hop-- but by the time NNB reached closer and UFO-standout ""Show Me Your Heart"", I was surrounded by khaki-clad thirty-somethings yelling, ""GO HOME FAGS!"" in between beer sips. Maybe getting jeered out of the Bowery was a humbling experience for the assertively strange Philly sextet, but chances are it wasn't a unique one, and if Where's Black Ben? is any indication, the hecklers only egg them on, pushing their music into starker, more obnoxiously goofy territory. And here they play provocateurs, aiming less to please those who dig than offend those who diss. In the barbate world of spazzcore, Need New Body aren't the best songwriters, or even the best musicians. Those titles go to Polysics or Man Man or Hella or Bablicon, depending on whom you ask. Need New Body's greatest assets are their most glaring deficiencies: a remote live presence; their albums' lawless lack of direction; and general, galling immaturity. (Check their website for a truly brain-curdling experience.) But when these aspects go untempered by, say, a general interest in writing music, the resultant drool is a bad trip. Last we heard from these crazies, they were drowning nuggets of oddball synth-pop in oceans of noise filler on 2003's UFO. One assumed (hoped) subsequent efforts would see them grow more discerning, not less. Ha ha, no. On Where's Black Ben? NNB shrug off their quondam melodic sleight like a bad hangover. While not lacking in catchiness, the album's hooks leave a funny aftertaste. Take opener ""Brite Tha Day"", whose retarded, geek emcee verses (""All the girlies get horny when I pick up the mic"") are almost forgiven by an adorable kids' hour chorus. Almost, but Jeff Bradbury's over-the-top vocals beg you to laugh first, sing along second-- a condescending listener cooperation exercise with little incentive to comply. Banjo strutters ""Poppa B"" and ""Peruvidia"" show touching sincerity (blame the wistful stringed instrument), but the feeling is more relief than enjoyment. Only on ""So St Rx"" does it all fall into place: Deigning to add melody to a lighthearted narrative about dead-end Philly kids (""'Oh, I'm hungry.' 'Really? Cool!' 'I dunno, you want souvlaki?'""), the band achieve synthesis. But whenever they appear to be hitting their stride-- such as on the brilliant, Sun Ra-homaging ""Outerspace""-- it's right back into whackhead mode. Petrified of normalcy-- something they couldn't achieve if they tried-- Need New Body undermine their own talents, and Where's Black Ben? offers little else but fodder for our epithet-slinging Hold Steady listener to dine out on.","Latest LP from the Philly-based spazzcore sextet.

22-20s,22-20s,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a3ea9e61561daa5883/1:1/w_160/c3fe9863.jpg,2005-06-21 06:00:17,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8296-22-20s/,Astralwerks,"Every genre's got its purists. For example, there's the three-chord wheeling, leather-studded punk mavens still preaching musical recklessness and revolution; the mascara-caked new wave gatekeepers now grown-up and working in accounting, still convinced Robert Smith and Morrissey are speaking directly to them; and your techno buffs, who just want things to stay the way they were-- in the year 2412. All are somewhat misguided in their attempts at genre preservation, but none foul it up like the hardcore blues camp. Isn't real blues supposed to be about dungarees, crafting guitar slides from beer bottles, and literally selling your soul to the devil, not the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin? I bring this up because Lincolnshire's 22-20s (named after a classic Skip James blues song) have accrued more blues cred than BRMC, the White Stripes, and the Kills with their self-titled debut, an offering that seemingly reaches back only to Britain's 1960s usurpation of American blues. However, to actually gauge the blues ""purity"" of any blues-rock artist today would be pointless. Time would be better spent trying to prove ""1"" is closer to infinity than ""0"" than comparing modern bands' faithfulness to Robert Johnson or Muddy Waters. And that's just fine, because blues would still be a derelict in contemporary music if not for some harmless blaspheming. Not surprisingly, the 22-20s' potency is inversely proportional to their incorporation of traditional blues. Sure, Rolling Stones and CCR are jumping-off points, but the auxiliary genre hopping really makes these songs sizzle. ""Shoot Your Gun"" and ""Such a Fool"" sneak in (gasp!) Beatlesque melodies and catchy Cheap Trick cock-pop. Despite its sapless lyrics (""I'm getting bored/ Of putting on a smile""), ""Baby Brings Bad News"" channels smarmy Britpop, hitting up mid-90s Blur for a wispy, piano-driven chorus. Exempting these three tracks, however, the band shrinks back into its shell, relying on automated blues-rock. Both ""Why Don't You Do It for Me"" and ""I'm the One"" are centered around a knee-slappin' blues lick, but botch opportunities to deliver an equally vibrant chorus and bridge, one of blues rock's most sacred cows. Then there's the rest, which is mostly rehashed Dylan and Fogerty, some innocuous Stevie Ray Vaughn knockoffs, and ""The Things That Lovers Do,"" a laughable regurgitation of Pearl Jam's ""Black."" Yes, NME's simultaneously shitting and pissing themselves, but the 22-20s evade most of the typical British rock potholes (i.e. histrionics, pretentiousness, unapologetic 60s-aping, among others), and can actually be taken at face value. Now if we could just touch-up the blemishes on that face...","On their debut LP, the Lincolnshire band recalls England's 1960s usurpation of American blues.

Pajo,Pajo,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19ac0084474cd0bfe45/1:1/w_160/67559af0.jpg,2005-06-21 06:00:16,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6575-pajo/,Drag City,"Like another singular musical intelligence named David, Dave Pajo is intimately familiar with changes. First he was in this band called Slint; apparently they were some kind of big deal. Ditto Tortoise. And as a solo artist under the guises of M, Papa M, and Aerial M, Pajo has quietly staked out territory at the nexus of pastoral folk and minimal electronica. He is a dim yet essential star in a musical constellation that includes Leonard Cohen, Iron and Wine, and Windsor for the Derby. Given his retiring demeanor and the subtlety of his solo work, everyone was thrown for a loop when he hooked up with the Great Pumpkin to glam out with Zwan. We all know how that turned out. After washing off his stage makeup and shaking the glitter out of his hair, Pajo is back in the murky, spare musical environment where he seems more at home: His new solo LP, recorded under his own name this time (reaffirmation of identity after hanging with the ego-devouring Corgan?), picks up more or less where Whatever, Mortal left off. Pajo's solo output has stayed within fairly narrow stylistic borders, but he's made minute adjustments in style and personnel. We talk about evolution when an artist makes a drastic change from one album to the next, but Pajo's growth seems more faithful to the spirit of the word: A slow, incremental process of refining and tweaking-- natural selection rather than rampant mutation. This time, he used a bare-bones recording process that enhances the aura of mystery surrounding his enigmatic meditations, producing the album with cheap software that came with his laptop and singing directly into the computer's microphone. Sounds sketchy on paper, but it works: If you're familiar with Pajo's music, you know he needs fancy production like Corgan needs a hairnet, and the hissy, unfettered recording makes the songs sound like decaying artifacts. Still, Pajo requires a few passes before the songs begin to differentiate and expand: Pajo's voice is a gray, remote apparition that tends to shade into a hoarse whisper. It's remarkably placid and still, and has a strange negating effect that can only be described as audible silence, if you'll forgive the abstraction. Forgoing instrumentals this time in favor of shimmering, spectral folk with electronic dressings, the eerie quietude does not relent, from the initial skittering dirge ""Oh No No"" to the final spoken-word echo chamber ""Francie"", even on the borderline rocker ""Baby Please Come Home"". This record doesn't intend to blow your hair back; it wants to get under your skin, and with its twinkling arpeggios, morbidly graceful lyrics, and barely there electronics, slowly, it does.","Former Slint, Tortoise, and Zwan member releases first LP under his own name.

OV,Orthrelm,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45c5e6ef95969323a3a/1:1/w_160/c09dead9.jpg,2005-06-21 06:00:15,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6113-ov/,Ipecac,"Orthrelm's OV consists of patterns laid across a giant, horizontal canvas, one after another. Each pattern (or algorithm or gestalt, to use academic terms often applied to minimalist artwork) is small-- perhaps the size of your average metal riff-- and is self-contained. That is, each one relates to nothing outside of itself, and works through a ""predictably terminating"" process before moving on to the next. Which is still to say, OV is both a blueprint and the final result of a pretty amazing idea: hardcore minimalism in a rock context. Hardcore? Minimalism? This record, which could almost as easily be communicated via a series of 8x10-inch grids containing tiny, elaborate arrangements of points and lines, crosses a whole range of ""high art"" concepts. In fact, its ""rock context"" is more dubious than its artsy conceits, raising the question of whether electric guitars have to signify rock, or are capable of something else. Indeed, OV is something else. In any case, isn't minimalism is supposed to be dead? That's what any art critic worth his pretension will tell you-- and has, on and off, for about 35 years-- despite the fact its remnants can be seen in almost every strand of art henceforth. Minimalist visual art happened as a result of simultaneous decisions made in the late 1950s by several young (and almost exclusively white male American) artists reacting against the wildly subjective Abstract Expressionist movement. Abstract expressionist artists like Jackson Pollack were about capturing personal experience or emotion in the purest, visceral sense. That's all well and good-- and sort of punk when you think about it-- but when Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman came along and did the same with broad planes of color and precisely defined geometrical shapes, it started to seem less a quasi-anarchic roar of purpose, and more a quasi-formalist one. So, rather than put forth subjective statements, the successive generation of artists aimed to produce art as object in and of itself, more apt to use mathematical formulas than emotional drive to create their works. This could manifest itself in anything from Sol Le Witt's math-generated sculptures, to Jo Baer's monochrome canvas-work to Dan Flavin's arrangement of neon lights on museum walls. There was a concurrent ""movement"" in classical music towards minimalism, though unlike in the visual art critical establishment, nobody really made an effort to brand it as such. In the early 60s, La Monte Young, described by Brian Eno as the ""grandfather of us all"", was writing really slow, really lengthy pieces of chamber music in the serialist tradition (then the dominant strain of modern classical music, serialism is the organization of notes, rhythms, and other musical elements according to numerical formulae)-- perhaps the musical equivalent of painter Robert Ryman's General series of pure white paintings. Young soon moved to working with sine waves and drone performances that could last for days, or longer. However, you can't really release an LP of a weeklong performance, and a more popular, compact strain of minimalism was port forth by Terry Riley, who used tape loops and delay to concoct sprawling, repetitive soundscapes. He completed the landmark In C in 1964, whose concepts led directly to a whole school of repetition-based music from which Steve Reich and Philip Glass (not to mention Neu! and Can) made a killing. Until now, I would never have thought to compare Orthrelm to those musicians. The Washington D.C.-based duo's previous albums-- including an almost inhumanly fragmented, 99-track EP (!) Asristir Vieldriox from 2002-- were models of monolithic non-repetition. Guitarist Mick Barr (formerly of Crom-Tech) and drummer Josh Blair (also of math-jazzers ABCs) specialized in music obviously rooted in metal, but performed as a steady string of ultra-speed riffs and brittle patterns, thrown against each other in Pollack-like collage: no clear linear progression, but when viewed from a distance, as technically impressive as it is chaotic. John Zorn's Naked City is a precedent, as Orthrelm recall the intensity of the fastest hardcore punk, and the virtuosity of the gone-est conservatory shredders-- not to mention being pretty light on their feet. However, if you wanted jams with beats and wailing choruses, you were out of luck; the band played alien etudes, but not necessarily ""rawk."" But if fans were left wanting something easier to tap along with, the band's latest delivers the goods in spades. OV, containing a single 45-minute composition, makes as good an introduction to putting oneself into a trance as it does to minimalism or instrumental prog. Although recorded over a period of months, the title piece is presented as a single performance, each segment locking into the next, on and on until everything simply stops. And just as I described Orthrelm's prior releases as monolithic, this one threatens to glaze over the eardrums of anyone not particularly fascinated by the prospect of a metal mosaic, massive in size with attention to minute detail. Yet, it is the attention to detail-- the baroque refinery of the individual riffs and drum patterns-- that makes OV more than just an impressive technical feat (or an excruciating bore). As with the additive, metric modulation of Glass (who cribbed his technique from Indian raga) or Reich's rhythmic phasing, Orthrelm somehow makes music more than the sum of its innumerable parts. At the heart of OV are adrenaline and discipline; abandon and meditation. I'm tempted to recommend the album to anyone interested in learning how to meditate; beyond the sheer length and precision of the music, I wonder if Barr and Blair had to put themselves in some kind of Zen state just to record the stuff. As the passages fly by-- beginning with the pounded tritone introduction, to a diced three-note guitar motive and tom-toms cascade, to sections featuring the thrash of cymbals and high-range dissonance alternating with sections where the drums drop out entirely and guitar lands on sustained, sine-like tones-- I look for inter-connections. Unlike traditionally minimalist music, OV's structure follows an ""A to B to C"" path, rather than the less intrusive (but arguably more subtle) ""A1 to A2 to A3"" method of Glass and Reich. On this record, each pattern takes on its own identity, seemingly unrelated to anything happened before-- yet, the speed and consistency of attack (Barr's fingers must be robotic) serve to blur the edges of what might otherwise sound disjointed. I'm not sure history's great minimal artists would approve of OV, on the structural grounds I noted above, or due to the fact that Orthrelm's music just seems so, well, big. Of course, Frank Stella's grid-like aluminum paintings were as tall as people, while some of the great single-artist installations of the 60s and 70s could take up entire galleries, so you never know. Ultimately, this record stands as a towering achievement in its own right, regardless the context you visualize. And maybe this many words are overkill for what I'm really trying to say: This is fucking great.","Hardcore minimalism from Ipecac: This unique LP consists of small, self-contained patterns of music laid across a giant, horizontal canvas.

First, there's the name Black Sunday: Whether it refers to Thomas Harris (who wrote a novel of that name about a blimp crash) or to the Great Depression (a tremendous dust storm obliterated millions of acres on Sunday, April 14, 1935), the phrase evokes immense disaster, widespread destruction, and an aftermath of funereal grief. Then there's the fact the Black Sunday is essentially Alicja Trout, who previously sang and played keyboards and guitars for the Lost Sounds and has recorded with various one-off lineups and incarnations, including the Clears, the River City Tan Lines, the Fitts, and, most recently, Mouse Rocket. Aside from a few guest musicians (including former Lost Sound Jay Lindsay, who plays drums on two songs), Trout plays all the instruments and wrote all but one of the songs, so Tronic Blanc (which she recorded in her Memphis studio, called Tronic Graveyard) sounds like her most solo album-- and, in some ways, the best realization of her unique aesthetic. As such, Tronic Blanc's technofear and paranoia-- not to mention its jaded resentment-- can be attributed solely to Trout. ""First, I cut my arms for you/ Then I cut my scars for you,"" she sings on ""Torture Torture"", with an immediacy that's chilling. Most of this personal angst surfaces in clone imagery-- not genetic regenerations, but mechanical substitutes. Songs like ""Torture Torture"", ""This Heart Is Now Aluminum"", and ""Modulated Simulated"" voice a very specific fear: That some enormous upheaval, like a bad break-up, will so overwhelm her that she might lose her emotional faculties and become a cold, metal-hearted machine. This panic is reflected in the music on Tronic Blanc, which pits live instrumentation against synthetic noises. On ""What I Think Is Wrong"", live drums compete with meowing keyboards, while on ""You're Gonna See Me"", real guitars counter canned beats. But Trout complicates that tension by making the drums sound preternaturally rigid and the guitars electronically sculpted, while her keyboard runs-- which have been a trademark at least since her days with the Clears (their one album is well worth seeking out and prefigures the current New Wave revival by almost a decade)-- often give the songs their heartbeat pulse. The line between the actual and the artificial constantly blurs, mirroring her confusion over real and false emotions. In a sense, Trout is Dr. Frankenstein and Tronic Blanc is the monster she's created in her studio lab. But complicating that literary comparison is the simple and overwhelming fact that despite the pain and fear the songs convey, Trout's music is exuberant, inventive, and full-to-bursting with ideas. As with previous projects, Trout's preferred m.o. is the restless, reckless conflation of genres: songs like ""This Heart Is Now Aluminum"", ""Modulated Simulated"", and ""Little Bird"" beat with garage-rock swagger and taut new wave grooves, while ""Destroy Everything in Your Path"" and ""Next Girl Detour"", with its shout-out chorus, swing with surf guitar momentum. Elsewhere, the DIY aesthetic lends ""Little Bird"" and ""On the Way Downtown""-- about the dangers of the Mississippi River-- their rough immediacy, as if Trout recorded them as soon as the ideas popped into her head. All these elements belie the grim undertones of Tronic Blanc, suggesting that simple expression can be not only catharsis, but a powerful defense against the dehumanizing disappointments of other people. ","Solo record from ex-Lost Sounds singer, guitarist, and keyboardist Alicja Trout.

Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73e9d034d5c69bf3744/1:1/w_160/ff1517e1.jpg,2005-06-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1811-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/,Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,"Maybe no one told Clap Your Hands Say Yeah that first impressions are important. Or maybe they've just got massive sack. Either way, their self-released, self-titled debut CD opens with the weirdest, most potentially grating bit of snake-oil salesmanship you're likely to hear until Tom Waits puts out another record. I happen to dig the song, entitled ""Clap Your Hands!"" (a theme is emerging), but a maniacal carny barking over a stuttering calliope isn't for everyone. Those who persevere, though, will quickly discover that this garish foyer gives out onto spacious, elegant chambers of clean lines and soft lights. Clap Your Hands are a five-piece from Brooklyn who're known to break out both harp and harmonica. They've recently been garnering rave press in their home city, and, over just the past two weeks, burning up the internet like a vintage Lohan nipslip. The pundits are saying Wilco (not hearing it), Talking Heads (okay), and Neutral Milk Hotel (getting warmer), but if it checks in with a number of modern and classic new wave referents, the music sings for itself: Clap Your Hands traffics in melodic, exuberant indie rock that pairs the shimmering, wafting feel of Yo La Tengo with a singular vocal presence that sounds like Paul Banks attempting to yodel through Jeff Mangum's throat. Or imagine the Arcade Fire if their music were more fun-loving and less grave. Of course, if Clap Your Hands had a press kit, it would undoubtedly include something about ""synthesizing these influences into a sound that's uniquely their own."" And for once, it would be true. On the album's first true song, ""Let the Cool Goddess Rust Away"", a wailing vocal evokes Walkmen frontman Hamilton Leithauser, as hitching, muted guitars and singing melodic ones twist and furl over throbbing bass. On ""Over and Over Again (Lost and Found)"", the band veers into more Interpol-ish territory, with small, stripped guitars and bass, a thin synth wash, and lilting vocals with woozily yawning vowels. Same goes for the iridescent guitars, purring synths, and weary vocals of ""Details of the War"". The record is consistently, remarkably strong, but ""The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth"" in particular stands out, with its richly buzzing synth phrases, textbook Modest Mouse guitar lead (a trebly, gliding string bend skimming over the rhythm like a flat stone over a pond), contrapuntal bass, and shuffling drums. The song also features one of vocalist Alec Ounsworth's most memorable performances: He ramps up the urgency as the heavier chords kick in, his voice cracking and shifting in cascading waves as if someone were pressing his vocal cords to a fret board and bending them. ""Is This Love?"", with its clean, galloping guitars and fruit loop synth trills is the song most blatantly redolent of Neutral Milk Hotel (especially of the unhinged pop and careening vocals Mangum favored on On Avery Island), and its dizzily wowing vocal harmonies carry over to ""Heavy Metal"", where fuzzed-out bass and wheezing harmonica punch smart shapes into the fizzy guitars. There's something really refreshing about stumbling across a great band that's trembling on the cusp without any sort of press campaign or other built-in mythology-- you actually get to hear the music with your own ears. While a lot of bands view the promotional apparatus as a necessary evil, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah prove that it's still possible for a band to get heard, given enough talent and perseverance, without a PR agency or a label. Indie rock has received a much-needed kick in the pants, and we have the rare chance to decide what a band sounds like of our own accord before any agency cooks up and disseminates an opinion for us. Damn, maybe this is how it's supposed to work! ","Every time it seems like conventional indie rock has gasped its last, someone builds a mansion of song that reminds us that, at its best, the genre still pulls off raw, celebratory spirit more convincingly than almost any other...

Ferocious Mopes,Say Hi to Your Mom,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ac13d1975652139232/1:1/w_160/80b2f1de.jpg,2005-06-20 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7814-ferocious-mopes/,RykoEuphobia,"All the glowing reviews you may (not) have read for Brooklyn-based Say Hi to Your Mom could well have been written by the one-man emo band's one man, Eric Elbogen. According to a Knight-Ridder article, Elbogen writes rock reviews under a pseudonym ""so he doesn't alienate labels he might want to partner with down the road"". Who knows, he might be writing these words right now. Or not: I took the L train to Bedford for the first time just Saturday night, but Elbogen already had a song about it and other yuppie-hipster touchstones on last year's Numbers & Mumbles. Home recordists today, unlike early-90s Sentridoh or even late-90s White Town, have enough technology at their fingertips to sound major, in that ""indie-rock""-is-the-new-""alternative"" kind of way. A certain careerism is sweeping even the once-artiest loft apartments. As a result, ""style is taking over,"" in the sardonic words of Say Hi's sonic forebear, Pedro the Lion's David Bazan, and songs are on the outs. Hence, Say Hi's arrangements happen to become less sugary (lo-carb craze?) and more darkly Arcade-Fire-anthemic on the outfit's third record, Ferocious Mopes-- especially on wistful, quiet-loud ""Dimensions and Verticals"" and ""The Twenty-Second Century"". How convenient. On a homemade PC, Elbogen assembles slow, statuesque, self-consciously ""indie"" rock with analog synthscapes, overlapping distorted guitars, lots of low-end, and Conorrifically quavering whispers. Lyrically, he makes two classic misapprehensions: quirkiness for originality, and sincerity for significance. So ""Poor Pete Is a Bit Self-Conscious"" tells the tale of a would-be vampire over a stomping arena beat, while ""Recurring Motifs in Historical Flirtings"" (yep, that's the title) rides the chilly-synths-are-rad-again trend to label ""let's just be friends"" ""the four worst words in our language"". Boo hoo hoo. Frustratingly, Elbogen would have genuine potential if he spent as much time on songwriting as on being fashionable. ""Yeah, I'm in Love With an Android"" is movingly odd, and the too-brief acoustic closer ""As Smart as Geek Is Chic Right Now"" stabs deeper than its look-at-me title to describe the misfortune of toys accidentally given brains. ""Let's Talk About Spaceships"", from Numbers & Mumbles, is an all-the-right-notes ballad of 21st-century insecurity that could please fans of either Grandaddy or, gulp, Jimmy Eat World. Which reminds me: ""Marc Hogan"" is really just Jim Adkins' pen name.","Third album from one-man emo band Eric Elbogen.

Jackinabox,Turin Brakes,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a830ea9e61561daa576f/1:1/w_160/c250dcb3.jpg,2005-06-20 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8189-jackinabox/,Astralwerks,"OK everyone calm down-- summer's officially here. Go swimming, catch fireflies...hell, even go to Lowe's and buy those plastic tiki torches that give suburbanites the illusion they're constantly in the Carribbean, because British folk duo Turin Brakes's third album Jackinabox wants you to enjoy your summer, at any cost. The duo's declared jihad on anyone who dares cast a cloud over their picturesque summer afternoon, and if you think they're joking, the lyrics to ""us vs. them"" R&R; anthem ""They Can't Buy the Sunshine"" should fortify their radical fundamentalist approach to leisure: ""They burned our churches to the ground/ But they can't buy the sunshine."" Lyrics like these have been just one part of the mystery that is Turin Brakes's success. They use safe folk-pop arrangements, exude a feel-good Simon and Garfunkel vibe, and write dewy-eyed words, yet have enjoyed a surprisingly warm reception from even the most miserly of reviewers. Not even fellow British softies Coldplay can make that claim. Unfortunately, Jackinabox pulls the rug out from this improbable run (or at least gives it a good tug), as here troubadours Ollie Knights and Gale Paridjanian sound as languorously adult alternative on the record as they appear on paper. Turin Brakes separated themselves from similarly delicate UK bands Athlete and Travis by avoiding unvarying, schmaltzy vocals-- and on the first parts of Jackinabox that distinction holds true. With its campfire cooing and rugged chord changes, ""Red Moon"" is Elliott Smith on Zoloft, climaxing with the excusably optimistic chorus ""If you try, you'll be alright."" However this formula exhausts itself on forgettable numbers like ""Forever"" and ""Above the Clouds"", where humdrum acoustic strumming and stagnant melodies form a stale film over Knights' and Parijanian's consistently colorful harmonies. In between these two extremes, Turin Brakes throw it on cruise control. ""Asleep With the Fireflies"" putzes through a Van Morrison template of a verse before launching into a funk-tinged country jamboree. ""Road to Nowhere"" and ""Buildings Wrap Around Me"" tap Nick Drake at his most bittersweet, but serve only as worthwhile fillers. In a sense Turin Brakes do little wrong on Jackinabox aside from the occasional gooey outbursts of gaiety. Though these good vibes grow monotonous, and even on downer ""Last Clown"" (""Last clown drinking in a bar that's about to be closed""), Knights can't hide the pep in his voice. But hey, maybe in this world of bleak Nick Hornby novels and cliffhanging mini-series drama, we need a definitively happy piece of work beginning to end. If not, I think I found the perfect Father's Day gift.","UK duo outlives the ""quiet is the new loud"" tags on their summery third album.

Gold,The Velvet Underground,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a079ea9e61561daa458f/1:1/w_160/3123d8cd.jpg,2005-06-20 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8436-gold/,Polygram,"As VU quips go, ""They only sold a few thousand records, but everyone who bought one started a band,"" is my least favorite; the ""everyone who bought one became a record critic"" variant seems more apt. For my money, the best thing ever written about the Velvet Underground remains this bit from Rob Sheffield's entry in the SPIN Alternative Record Guide: ""We understand this music so well because every corner of it has been absorbed. VU studio goofs have become established sub-genres."" It's true. From the time they disbanded, the Velvet Underground have been present in most skewed versions of rock, from glam to punk to new wave to noise. If you only considered that Kraftwerk, Can, and David Bowie idolized and borrowed from VU, and think about all the places their music has traveled, well, that covers an insane amount of geography right there. Indie rock, in particular, is unthinkable without them, so it feels a bit odd to be reviewing a double-disc set of their best work for Pitchfork: Chances are, you've already internalized the four albums proper and Live 1969, and could tell me quickly which 30 songs are your all-time favorites. Needless to say, this compilation wasn't designed with the average Pitchfork reader in mind. What it was designed to do-- and what it does rather well-- is replace 1989's The Best of the Velvet Underground: Words and Music of Lou Reed, an awkwardly titled, coldly assembled sampler that was in print far too long. Gold is two discs selling for a single disc price, and it includes almost all of the best-known and most often covered songs in their catalog: nine of 11 songs from The Velvet Underground & Nico, three of six from White Light/White Heat, five of 10 from Velvet Underground, and three live versions of the 10 songs from Loaded. The two unreleased collections VU and Another View are also well represented, and two songs from Nico's Chelsea Girl are included, as well. Someone with $14 to spend who hasn't heard a note of this is in for a ride. Personally, I've had a hard time getting past ""Sister Ray"", which has the most gloriously filthy combination of guitar, organ, and amps ever assembled in one room. I just want to keep hitting the ""back"" button. But it's also been nice to revisit the shrieking viola of ""Venus in Furs"", which alarmed me when I first heard it so many years ago but now just sounds darkly sensual and almost playful. Hearing the heavy stuff next to twee bits like ""Sunday Morning"" and ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", which stand up beautifully, only affirms the staggering range of this band, as exemplified in the Sheffield quote above. The more I think about their range, the clearer it becomes why the Velvet Underground are so difficult to anthologize for listeners who want to understand the full scope of what made them important. Their albums really are albums, and you need to hear the great songs next to the less accessible ones to get a full picture of the band. You gotta sit through ""European Son"" to hear how crazily noisy they could get and plod through ""The Gift"" to understand how badly they wanted their music to be taken as seriously as literature. And hey, how can a 30-song collection of Velvet Underground songs not include any Moe Tucker leads? Reed and John Cale provided the cool and Nico was around a while for the beauty, but the Velvet Underground picture is so must more interesting when you consider that this sweet-voiced woman occasionally took the mic to sing a simple ditty. Still, where summarizations of their catalog are concerned, Gold is easily the best yet, and while aspiring music fanatics will want and need all of the band's individual full-lengths, this should suit the rest of the world just fine.","Bargain-priced 2xCD set fails to capture VU's complete range, but it nevertheless includes all of the influential band's best-known tracks and is its best career anthology to date.

4,Major Stars,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08c5e6ef9596931ff96/1:1/w_160/86db91dd.jpg,2005-06-20 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5653-4/,Twisted Village,"Wayne Rogers and Kate Bigger's vast output is an essential touchstone for psych heads, but they're often snubbed in scene round-ups and other psychedelic primers. If discussed at all, mentions barely move beyond standard-issue guitar freak-out metaphors. Worse, the two are spoken of in the past tense. It's particularly surprising that their excellent current project, Major Stars, hasn't noticeably benefited from the renewed interest in Blue Cheer raucousness and distended fret shredding. They did collaborate on Live In Europa, a split LP with Comets on Fire, but otherwise seem to be shuffling along a murky path toward underground respect sans popular recognition. The trip started when Rogers formed Crystallized Movements with drummer Ed Boyden in 1980, while the two were still in high school. Biggar (aka Kate Village) joined Rogers a few years later and ever since the two have created some of the best underground American guitar music of our time while also running run the Cambridge-based Twisted Village label/record store. High points have been Magic Hour (with Galaxie 500's Damon and Naomi as rhythm section) and any number of Rogers' darkly plaintive and wailing solo albums. There are also raw spin-offs like Bongloads of Righteous Boo, Heathen Shame, Vermonster, and Wormdoom. After Damon and Naomi left Magic Hour to focus on their Exact Change literary press and eponymous folk, Rogers and Biggar formed Major Stars with bassist Tom Leonard (aka the equally underrated Luxurious Bags) and drummer Dave Lynch (Vermonster). The new rhythm section offers a heavier center than Damon & Naomi, who stitched a beautifully diaphanous undertow. Until now, the quartet's best effort was 2002's Distant Effects. But 25 years into the game, Rogers and Biggar have here turned out some of their best work yet. With Rogers/Biggar, you rarely get much fanfare: Despite their lavish guitar playing, these folks come off spartan: 4 is their fourth album and it contains four songs. On the other hand, it's also Major Star's first album put to tape in a 24-track studio-- and the increased fidelity is a revelation. When played loud enough, it almost matches the awe-inspiring feeling of their live shows. The session is from July 2003, and boasts phenomenal guitar licks, extended and acrobatic soloing, a dense and smoky (but also chilly and somehow pristine) atmosphere, and Wayne Rogers' shadowy voice, which is best described as deep, inked, and syrupy. It reminds me of constellations seen through dead New England trees. Or if J Mascis were a monk and not a stoner. I'm usually a big stickler for lyrics, but have never paid too much attention to what Rogers' is intoning. In general, what matters more than a libretto is how he breathes and tumbles between the guitars. On ""All Or Half The Time"", he lulls with beautiful melancholia while the guitars provide high-level fireworks. Then comes the alternately lulling/blistering/nimble and everything in between 13-plus minute instrumental ""Song For Turner"", and it's clear why the words don't much matter. Remarkably, unlike Comets On Fire or other band's they've helped spawn, the soloing is never harsh: Even when there's a storm of feedback, it always feels like a pillow. But a pillow proffered doesn't mean you'll sleep. This is the music of revelation and throwing off the sky's geometry; it maintains a heavy feeling of night, but more like sweaty 3 a.m. epiphany. If Kieran Hebden hadn't already grabbed Everything Ecstatic for his new Four Tet offering, the name could've served as the less modest title for this glorious mountain of sky-melting psychedelia. There, I said it.","Wayne Rogers and Kate Biggar's first album put to tape in a 24-track studio is, perhaps not coincidentally, also their best.

Because throwing actual fannies the ""FEATURING 2 RARE TRACKS"" bone is a lame move. Because the cover art collage fronting this effort is as ugly as the original album art being collaged.

Because, if you're a fair-weather fan looking for ""Nearly Lost You"", it would be stupid to pay $11 just to have it in your collection. Because you're sick of CDs being filled with crap just because a CD can hold 80 minutes of music. Because clearly Mark Lanegan's success as a solo artist and part-time Queens of the Stone Age vocalist means the time is right to re-evaluate a group that was for grunge, if this compilation is any sort of barometer, what Drowning Pool was for nu-metal, or what Spent was for indie rock (and your sarcasm detector is broken). Because you don't want to hear a young Lanegan pass a kidney stone while fronting an above-average bar band. Because the compilers frontloaded this disc with the most derivative crap of the lot, so when one finally gets to the decent songs (mostly from Sweet Oblivion or Dust), you'll be hard pressed to care. Because the best song is still ""Nearly Lost You"", and being stuck in the middle of this morass does it no favors-- it sounds just as mundane and turgid and wanky as what preceded and what follows. Because it will take more than a few listens to discern anything of interest from the stand-out tracks, like the mellotron-laden ""Traveler"" or ""E.S.K"", a track that actually sounds like the mixture of psychedelic garage pop and grunge rock that would-be street-teamers claim is the hallmark of Screaming Trees' best work. Because a sloppy, blues-as-a-bad-thing track like ""Paperback Bible"" quickly disposes of any good will the good stuff engenders.

Uhhh Sort Of,Applied Communications,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c1b1335d7bf1698332/1:1/w_160/58b8dd58.gif,2005-06-19 06:00:26,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/477-uhhh-sort-of/,Disco Mariscos,"Uhhh Sort Of is an irritating, scattershot, often-difficult mess of an album, but a little backstory might leave you wondering if that's precisely as it should be. Max Wood, the kid behind the mess, started the album when he was 16 years old. His mother had just passed away, leaving him with just one grandparent to call family. And he'd begun to suspect that the attention-deficit computer collage of the music he'd made so far was doing the wrong thing-- leaning on jokes and leaning on irony as a way of avoiding any real emotional statement. And then a few months at his computer give us this: A record where all the mess and all the irony could feasibly break your heart. The only catch is that you might not be able to bear listening to it in the first place. The ""songs"" have a slovenly basement buzz on par with Pavement's first singles and God Ween Satan-- and unlike parts of those, Wood is largely insensitive to the notion of developing things like melodies and song structures. No, he just runs together ticky-tack drum machine beats, sews a noisy mess of synth and sample around them, and then rants-- in a nasal, whiny, geekbrat voice that's guaranteed to send ninety percent of listeners racing for the off button. Better still, how about a geekbrat stuck on irony, self-doubt, and self-consciousness? ""Yeah, I lack confidence,"" he says. ""Popular music contributes little to society,"" he says. ""This is awesome,"" he says, ""this is the best song ever."" Then he closes the album out with several minutes of repeating the same thing: ""I have a point/ I have to live/ I cannot die."" Which is my roundabout way of saying that this stuff has more scary, raw emotion in it than you might imagine, all expressed in the painfully ironic, annoyingly self-conscious manner that scary, raw teenage breakdowns actually take. I asked Wood what artists he thinks this might have a kinship with, and his first response was Daniel Johnston-- a mentally ill singer-songwriter whose songs offer a sometimes uncomfortably direct line into a peculiar life. He could just as easily have pointed to Gary Wilson, another teenage-basement type whose neuroses leap right up from the vinyl. Meanwhile, Uhhh Sort Of is 30 minutes of a guy withering, lecturing himself, saying ""awesome"" a lot, and baldly hyperventilating about loving his mother-- over joyous, scattershot sample-pop that blurts like Kleenex Girl Wonder gone weird. For most people, it'll get written off as annoying, self-indulgent, and amusical, or maybe just a one-shot novelty, and there's plenty of evidence to support those points of view. For a few people, though, it might win a particular spot in the mind-- as part of a line of teenage confrontations with bad feeling and self-consciousness, brought neatly into the PC age, and damned cathartic about it.","Thirty minutes of a guy withering, lecturing himself, saying ""awesome"" a lot, and baldly hyperventilating about loving his mother.

Here Come the Tears,The Tears,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a213d19756521396cd/1:1/w_160/6a9e3ac6.jpg,2005-06-19 06:00:25,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8295-here-come-the-tears/,Independiente,"For two albums, Brett Anderson and Bernard seemed as if they could grow to become the Morrissey & Marr of the 90s-- Suede's self-titled debut and its follow-up, Dog Man Star, are among the best records of Britpop, and even the B-sides they wrote together were pretty consistently amazing songs. The fraying and ultimate disintegration of their creative relationship pushed Dog Man Star to its final gloriously turgid, expansive state, with each musician trying to muscle his best ideas to the front. That album isn't just a collection of a band's recently written songs, it's a sweeping picture of despair and interpersonal meltdown. Post-Butler, Suede distanced themselves from that sound, opting instead to become a sort of gutter party band. The catharsis seemed to sap Butler as well-- his solo records are only a song or two removed from totally mediocre, and aside from ""Yes"" I'd rather not think about his collaboration with David McAlmont. Ten years later, Suede are dead, Butler's way under the radar and here come the Tears, the official reunion of Anderson & Butler. It's a reunion that's been about as low-key as a reunion between these two could possibly be, given that Suede were once so huge that Virgin Megastores across Britain changed their name to Head Music for a day to mark the release of the band's fourth album. Listening to the results, it seems as though they genuinely enjoy working together again-- when Anderson refers to ""you and me"" on ""Two Creatures"" and talks about running away to warmer weather in Africa, it almost sounds like he's talking to Butler and not some anonymous girlfriend as the guitarist's distinctively dissonant leads snake alongside his vocal. That amity is perhaps a part of the reason Here Come the Tears doesn't quite measure up to the duo's past together-- the seething tension and bitchy moodiness of their original partnership undeniably made the music better and more intense. The other reason things aren't quite as transcendent this time is the more mundane matter of Brett Anderson-- he's selling his voice to tobacconists on an installment plan and can't do melodrama like he used to. Plus, years of frequently lazy lyric writing with Suede Mk II haven't entirely cleared up. That said, there also are no songs that simply list the ways in which various unrelated people are decadent and none that string together references to gasoline, diesel, alcohol, polythene, and trash in a random sequence. Removed from the context of their past work (ha!), Here Come the Tears is a good album, one with the respective drum and bass work of Mako Sakamoto and Nathan Fisher grounding sweeping ballads like ""Apollo 13"" and driving the speedier songs solidly so that Butler's guitar is free to roam, jousting with the vocal melodies. Butler is still an impressive guitarist-- his solo on ""Lovers"" is a particular highlight. Other hallmarks of the classic Dog Man Star-era sound that surface here include the wandering, Leslie'd pianos and smearing, slightly antagonistic string arrangements, which are held back for just the right moments. So color me pleasantly surprised-- I really expected very little from an Anderson/Butler reunion, but they've ably demonstrated that my old-guard Suede fan anxiety was unfounded with catchy, dramatic songs like ""Imperfections"" and ""Lovers"". There's nothing as great as ""New Generation"", ""She's Not Dead"", or ""The 2 of Us"" but there doesn't have to be, either, because the Tears have enough natural dynamism of their own to stand alone.","Former Suede mates Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler reunite for the first time in a decade.

The Future Embrace,Billy Corgan,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73cea9e61561daa553c/1:1/w_160/9ee77821.jpg,2005-06-19 06:00:24,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1810-the-future-embrace/,Warner Bros.,"In an alternate world, The Future Embrace could pass for an average shoegaze record with a few OK songs. Because really that's what we got here: Tracks like ""Mina Loy (M.O.H.)"" and ""DIA"" cough up all the proven pink noise progressions, hot drums pushed back in the mix, so-called lush layers of guitar distortion, an acceptable vocal melody, frothing overdrive, etc. Even the single ""Walking Shade"", however hookless and octave-bass trendy as electro-funk (think the Killers, then thank mixing boy Alan Moulder), still sounds enough like New Order at times that, hey, things are gonna be fine-- one less Out Hud song on the radio. Unfortunately, Billy Corgan's changed a few lives in his time, which makes it difficult for some people (me, at least) to have any sense of the song's musical merits before their brains pavlov. For a time, Smashing Pumpkins were tops; in my neighborhood alone, dressing up for Halloween as the Asian Guy From Smashing Pumpkins was a politically acceptable if not publicly applauded costume choice. So was making your own ZERO shirt, and locking yourself in your locker, despite all your rage. So there are, in fact, two ways The Future Embrace can, will, and possibly should be read. The first is, like I said, as just another shoegaze record with some/many lyrical missteps (a teaser: ""On the ninth day God created SHAME!!!!!!!""). The second: Although Pumpkins fans enjoy explaining to their peers how, actually, Corgan recorded most of Siamese Dream himself, etc., The Future Embrace really is his first solo record. He's dropping the ruse of band co-operation, and, however much it's often untrue, asking us to read his songs to be at least partially autobiographically. Officially, Corgan no longer represents Smashing Pumpkins (or Zwan), just himself, and the solo run implies a certain interest in showing his true face to those who want to see it. ""All Things Change"" has loveful guitars and flimsy drums and really nasally vocals. But for the Corganites this is The Artist justifying his return, explaining his motives for disbanding the Pumpkins, putting faith in pop music, and steeling himself in a way that, if we're buying into the song as a personal account, is kinda sorta affecting. The song's last line, ""We can change the world,"" is cliche, sure, but so is ""I love you"" to your girlfriend, and ""I can't believe I'm doing this"" to yourself before the virgin line-- what matters more is Corgan's saying it. So, forgive Corgan his infinite lyrical badness, but know that infinity's a lot to forgive. ""You are love/ You are soul/ You are real to me"" is bad, approaching the level of ""Can I give my old heart TO YOU!!!!!!!"", also a line from The Future Embrace. In fairness, I don't remember what I was thinking exactly when I first heard something like, ""I torch my soul to show/ The world that I am pure,"" stuff like that. Anyway, while that line from ""Rocket"" seems intentionally poetic, The Future Embrace doesn't seem to aspire to the craft's inherently mediated affair. This is Corgan talking candidly to the mirror, a recording for himself and interested fans, but a big fuck-you to anyone who never cared in the first place. I can't reward that, but I think I get it: When we talk to ourselves about stuff, most of us don't think in necessarily poetic terms-- we just think what we feel. Granted, I've never said something like, ""Every time I start reaching out to find you/ Loneliness abounds,"" but you get the point. Tonally and compositionally, The Future Embrace is either samey or consistent depending on your mentality, but Corgan throws one undeniable curve with his cover of the Bee Gees' ""To Love Somebody""-- thirds dropped and Robert Smith on backup vox to boot. Turns out it's not a straight cover; Corgan personalizes it in a spot. Perhaps underscoring the tension he's had in his own career-- a tension he seems to enjoy talking about-- Corgan doesn't sing, ""And I'm blind, so very blind,"" as scripted, but instead asks himself, ""Am I so blind, blind to believe?"" Woof. For an answer, we might turn back to Corgan's cover of ""Destination (Unknown)"": ""I know I'll leave when it's my time to go/ Till then I carry on with what I know."" The swoons fight the groans.","The Great Pumpkin unveils his first official solo album, and it's a vaguely shoegaze LP with Corgan talking candidly to the mirror-- a recording for himself and interested fans.

Oceanic Remixes / Reinterpretations,Isis,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b98f13d197565213ae9d/1:1/w_160/43eeccd5.gif,2005-06-19 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11762-oceanic-remixesreinterpretations/,Hydra Head,"To heavy metal purists, Isis are essentially already a remix. Their disgorged sounds feel roughly metal, but there's something else coursing through and fucking with the template: Check out the buried vocals, the guitars stacked like whirlpools, the elastic bridges that give and take without proper crescendos, and just the general hybridization via all those shoegaze elements. On Oceanic Remixes / Reinterpretations, the Los Angeles-by-way-of-Boston quintet fill two CDs with composers, rockers, and knob-turners twiddling with and reforming their 2002 full-length, Oceanic. Originally a series of 12"" singles this compilation gathers the entire run, including a varied cast from Atomsmasher/Khanate dude James Plotkin (who turns-in a lovely, dank ""The Other"") to the Oktopus from Dälek (who opens an Atari 2600 Pandora's Box on ""False Light""). As would be expected, if you like Isis you won't necessary like this album, and vice versa. Remixes are tricky. No matter who's providing source material, questions inevitably arise amongst some listeners: Can the remix stand by itself? Or is the value of the material in seeing how sources are rearranged into endless permutations? I'm of the thought that the originals don't much matter-- I imagine these echoes and drones as new formations and see if they float. So there have been times I've liked the rewrites more than the originals. More often, in spite of myself, I listen to the second drafts and consider why this or that interpreter went one way or the other, still considering it in tandem with the starter material. Here, most of the tracks I enjoyed plucked a single thread from the original and found a way to weave it into a new nest elsewhere. Christian Fennesz's implosion of ""Weight"" transforms the track into a weightless homunculus. (It sounds like a teeming, contoured, elegant Fennesz song.) Tim Hecker's ""Carry"" tosses various textual shifts over a fluctuating bed of drone; tiny percussive ripples glitch out at the end. Some find new corners and angles left open for invasion and then tearing the original blueprint apart: Mike Patton, whose Ipecac label released Oceanic as well as its successor, Panopticon, transforms ""Maritime"" into a gypsy's quake-basket circus romp hosted by crotchety Mr. Bungle beside a plastic kiddie pool. On the other hand, there are too many un-intriguing instances like Venetian Snares' ""The Beginning and the End"" and DJ Speedranch's ""Carry: Like I Will Love Her Forever?"" (Fuckin Die!!!),"" which come off like slightly fractured alterna-metal. Other mixes dull: Aaron Turner's vocals are usually buried, so a few decide to make them resurface super upfront. And it's here that I imagine Isis sounds most like the haters want them to: flat, fairly generic, and totally not mysterious. The one participant to up ante is JK Broadrick of Jesu and Godflesh. Yoking delay and echo to ""Hym"", he extends the track by over five minutes and appends unforeseen movements. The general opening triumph remains largely in tact, but he dampens the drums, doubles certain passages, equalizes, and transforms it into a loping choral dervish. Then, pulling out the rug, he removes space between the drum hits, warping crescendos into a frantic seasick sluice. Later-- because the track warrants notations of the passage of time-- the vocals turn especially raw bloody. (Vocals sprout where they didn't exist in the original.) The final few minutes build a raft of harmonic acoustics that float placidly alongside a vocal drift. The author John Barth wrote a piece once about how a writer should avoid using epigraphs that are better written than the book they precede. This in mind, the Isis curators wisely stick Broadrick's ""Hym"" in the final slot of Disc Two. If it came earlier, everything in it's wake would seem lame and mundane. As is, the coda adds a bit of last-minute revelation. I guess that's another reason folks remix rock records: By rescuing even a single element previously buried or turning down something upfront, you fuck with the song's hierarchy and allow the shock of the new to slip right on in. It's like remaking a memory.","Christian Fennesz, Tim Hecker, and the Oktopus from Dälek are among those who remix tracks from Isis' Oceanic.

Circling the Sun,The Orange Peels,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ee9d034d5c69bf5331/1:1/w_160/65e195d0.jpg,2005-06-16 06:00:33,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6020-circling-the-sun/,Parasol,"A peach is sort of like an orange, except it tastes good on Cheerios and if you're lazy you can eat the peel. In 1993, Blur recorded a B-side (later a U.S. bonus track) called ""Peach"", in which Damon Albarn murmurs, ""Chemical eats/ Best part of the peach."" A year later, as Allen Clapp & His Orchestra, Orange Peels bandleader Allen Clapp recorded a lo-fi pop song called ""Why Sting Is Such an Idiot"". But in 2005, on his third album with the Orange Peels, the Clapp-- as he's called by uncreative schoolchildren, drunken friends, and smarmy critics-- has long since traded his four-track for ProTools. His Peels lie, peeling, unappealingly, in the synthetic sun, studio chemicals devouring their best parts like the 90-lb. Kappa who always wins the burger-eating contest, their infinite MORdom and bafflingly childish lyrics occasionally out-idioting a guy too dumb just to pay Roxanne already and get down to tantric biznass. OK, OK, anyone familiar with music HIStory (Jacko not guilty shocka! Jacko not pertinent double-shocka!) knows that what's really punk/indie/rawk is to defy the underground's inevitable strictures. The Minutemen covered Creedence, Hüsker Dü's bassist had a handlebar mustache, and Billy Corgan still won't shut up about how much he loves Black Sabbath. So I guess that makes Circling the Sun the indiest of indie-pop records, subverting the vague genre's idiosyncrasies with adult-contemporary production values. I say REO, you say Speedwagon! Look, you haven't heard left-coast luminaries like the Beach Boys or the Byrds until you've heard their sounds recontextualized as hyper-Mellotronned Disney-ballad rejects. ""Kokomo"" was nothing. On ""So Right""-- a re-recording of a stripped-down 2002 solo version-- the Clapper takes full advantage of his studio time to over-emote a dandyish vocal vibrato worthy of Dream Theater from 1997's soft-prog mostly-dud Fallling Into Infinity. Even the panning echo effects halfway through ""I Don't Wanna Shine"" (think fellow fruit band Lemon Pipers) sound too mall-ready to blow minds. The dude on Trio's mullet special who thinks Nirvana killed music? He likes this album. Do you own the Zombies' lethally schlocked 2004 reunion album? Your granddaughter probably gave you this for Father's Day. Still, like fellow indie-pop disappointments Aberfeldy, the Orange Peels' worst sin is that they speak English. The latest in Clapp's panoply of weather songs broach the topic as banally as Water Cooler Guy did this afternoon (i.e., without Lucksmithian ingenuity). The rhymes remain a study in amateurishness: ""Everyone was there/ There was something in the"" ... air! ""Everything seems wrong/ I put on the rain"" ... song! ""And listen to it every night/ Just to try to convince myself that it was all"" ... right! Despite the bright, gorgeous melodies underlying the record, only ""What's It's Like (Mary Jo)"" comes close to making up for the lacquered production and lyrical excruciation. With a shuffling beat, the song displays the album's least-overthought arrangement and simple lyrics that actually work, plus the record's best rhyme (""Doris Day""/""naivete""). Clapp-ing ensues. Then the indie pop sun retreats behind more digital clouds. Christ, Sting released ""Fields of Gold"" in 1993! Like peaches, Orange Peels are sometimes the pits.","Allen Clapp subverts indie pop's idiosyncrasies with adult-contemporary production values.

Thrills,Ellen Allien,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17cb1335d7bf1698285/1:1/w_160/fe1f0b03.jpg,2005-06-16 06:00:32,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/414-thrills/,Bpitch Control,"Thrills rocks ""been there done that"" like a yearlong Berlin residency. Citykid Ellen Allien's through with fooling (Stadtkind), through with mindblowing, genre-defiant, vox-happy mass appeal (Berlinette). Her new one's ""I'm making real techno now"" approach comes through loud/clear: no glitch, no ruse of song, straight-up bangers off quaint analog, and the back to mine instant cred of her rare ARP 2600 purchase. So apparently Allien's serious now-- at the very least serious about seeming serious. The functional grind is brutal at first. Round one, Allien only goes down good when she sticks to trashscapes: ""Cloudy City"" cops bellhead drums and fries them 8-bit, a disorienting groove that takes a minute for the head and arse not to look the same. ""She Is With Me"", same thing, though much prettier; this time the glitch is less programmatic-- the deep bass keychain sound FX synths get lost in echo, and accumulate, and collide. When Thrills finally makes sense-- it's a genre record, unconcerned with newness and interested primarily in dropping tight loops with well-tempered size/movement gestures-- those songs we liked first stick out sore. They do, to my ear, sound less serious, next to Allien's Anthems. ""Come"", that mature leadoff track ready to explode but Victorian enough not to, never drops a snare. On the backend, ""Magma"" insists on minimal clicks and hums, the volume knob upped and downed with the guise of build-- surely to land itself on Fabriclive 30 between some Melchior throwback and a Senor Coconut track, remixed by Crazy Remixer Dude Nobody Actually Cares About. I guess there's merit there, but I'm not smiling; not dancing either. Am I bummed Allien's resigned herself to making just another serious techno record with but one memorable track? Am I bummed that said memorable track (""The Brain Is Lost"") is only memorable because it sounds like Mu's ""Tiger Bastard"" and Output electro-goth shit in general? Do I think the fabulously titled ""Ghost Train"", which I would respect on name alone, is an excellent example of Allien accidentally insisting her half-finished tracks are, in fact, stubborn loops that I should approve of on grounds of build and confidence, instead of bemoaning their monochromaticism and lack of ambition? Why is ""Naked Rain"" not as cheeky as it should be? Not that all simple things need to be more complex, nor do heavy things need better larfs, but yeah: I do miss Allien's playfulness. What I get from Thrills is not a natural outgrowth but a conscious break from her own musical trajectory-- not to mention Bpitch in general, however much either has been dictated by other musicians (Apparat, Smash TV). She's onto some good shit here, but there's too much learning on the job.","Bpitch control label head with the follow-up to her breakthrough Berlinette LP.

Try Clouds, Grey Weather, the Feathers, the Lightweights, or the Anti-Gravity League (is that one taken yet?), for instance. Those all capture something in their sound, which is a soft, floating brand of ethereal shoegazer dreampop that hits with the force of a peck on the cheek. Not that this is a bad thing, mind you. Their gentle approach is justified by the fact that their songs are quite memorable, written with a sense of grandeur and astral beauty. There are no sharp edges on the band's debut, self-titled full-length, and any that might have cropped up (the guitars in ""One in Seven"", say) are sanded down by the wet, five-fathom production into rounded objects. Anyway, most of these songs would sound pretty good even without the oceans of reverb, something that's a fairly rare feat in texture-based rock. Complex vocal counterpoint hovers over organ and electric piano on ""New Horizons"" before the restrained drums kick in and gauzy guitars slide in to fill out the sound, and the effect is something akin to the quiet interlude of Yes' ""Close to the Edge"". The programmed beats come out on ""Let's Just See"", and the band syncopates the whole song across the strange rhythm they've cooked up, backward guitars and ribbons of phaser swirling in the wings. Faraway strings add their glow to the super-soft-rock ballad ""Forgiveness"", a pillow of a song that overdoes the lulling roundness, leading to serotonin release and even sleep. The big harmonies that feel too gentle there feel great on ""Come in and out of the Rain"", though, a song with bolder dynamics and stratospheric chorus. The highlight is the opener: ""Home"" begins with a little organ and acoustic guitar supporting a group vocal but moves quickly into a big, dripping cavern where every surface glistens and guitars are keyboards are strings are guitars, all mixing into one shimmery texture. On second thought, the term ""shoegazer,"" which I used earlier, doesn't seem quite right, even though comparisons to bands like Slowdive and 7% Solution certainly hold up. These guys are definitely looking up and finding all the inspiration they need in the vastness above. The lack of gravity is an occasional knock against them, but by and large they make good use of their weightlessness, and Engineers is a solid debut.","Shimmering shoegaze (not shoegaze) colors this UK band's debut LP.

Humming By the Flowered Vine,Laura Cantrell,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50f5e6ef959693209f5/1:1/w_160/8b5e9687.jpg,2005-06-16 06:00:30,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1287-humming-by-the-flowered-vine/,Matador,"Tradition has it that artists come to Nashville to make it in country music, but Laura Cantrell had to leave her hometown to establish her career. Attending college in New York and fast-tracking toward a bank career, she started DJ'ing a radio show spotlighting local and traditional artists and eventually released two well-received albums for Diesel Only Records (run by her husband Jeremy Tepper). Humming By the Flowered Vine, her third full-length and Matador debut, doesn't stray from that familiar territory: Like its predecessors, it's full of sweetly sung melodies and deceptively simple arrangements of originals and lovingly chosen covers. Superficially, Cantrell's songs would sound perfectly at home between Allison Krauss and Norah Jones on any playlist, despite the genre differences between them. That's not a damning observation, though: As with Krauss (but less with Jones), below the placid surface of Cantrell's music runs a current of heartbreak that's all the more potent for being so well hidden. It's a hurt inherited from nearly a century of country music tradition, but Cantrell tints it with the patina of personal experience. In other words, she doesn't need to be innovative when she is so expressive. Produced by JD Foster, Humming By the Flowered Vine is slightly more ambitious and decorous than her first two albums. Cantrell corrals an impressive stable of collaborators, including former Blood Orange Mark Spencer and Tin Hat Trio's Rob Burger. Her touring guitarist Dave Schramm even contributes the relatively baroque original ""And Still"", which features Joey Burns and John Convertino of Calexico. But these personalities are well integrated into a larger sound, and the result is a much richer, more nuanced backdrop for Cantrell's voice, enlivening the swing rhythms of ""What You Said"" and ""Wishful Thinking"" and lending a spare texture to ""Bees"" and ""Khaki & Corduroy"". Still, Cantrell remains squarely the focus of the album. Recalling contemporaries such as Krauss and Iris Dement-- as well as forebears like Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline at her most restrained-- she still sounds as down-home and unpretentious as ever, with a sophisticated simplicity that's more Big Apple urbane than Music Row countrypolitan. The lead track, a cover of Emily Spray's ""14th Street"", describes the nervous hope of unrequited love through plainspoken lyrics, but the songs's power comes from the arcing chorus melody and from Cantrell's gentle delivery, which drops into a sing-speak whisper as it expresses her truest desire: ""Maybe one step or two/ Then I'd be walking next to you."" Most of the tracks on Humming By the Flowered Vine similarly nurse a kernel of ache. ""Khaki & Corduroy"" evokes a young Southerner's dislocation in the big city, and the standout ""Bees"" gracefully conveys end-of-life yearning. ""I miss the beach/ I miss the honey/ I miss them humming by the flowered vine,"" Cantrell sings delicately. ""My time is short now/ I feel it coming/ I see you darling in morning light."" Instead of grandstanding for maximum tearjerker drama, Cantrell, accompanied by Ted Reichman's elegant piano, emphasizes the track's quiet wistfulness without sounding precious or slight. This understated approach works against her only occasionally, as on the traditional ""Poor Ellen Smith"". Her voice is entirely too clam to convey the grief and confusion of a wrongly accused man, and the narrative's violence and injustice feel transparent and too close to the surface. Finally Cantrell does go back to Nashville: Humming By the Flowered Vine closes with the singer wandering the streets of her hometown on ""Old Downtown"", urged onward by Schramm's frayed guitar. She's struck by the city's complicated and conflicted history-- not Music Row but the monument to WWI hero Sergeant Alvin York. Gradually her civic musings give way to a feeling of personal loss as she realizes that her hometown is no longer her home.","More Big Apple urbane than Music Row countrypolitan, the singer's third album is her first for Matador.

Tales From Turnpike House,Saint Etienne,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33ec0084474cd0c021b/1:1/w_160/819bf8a7.jpg,2005-06-16 06:00:29,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6976-tales-from-turnpike-house/,Mantra,"More than a decade into their career, Saint Etienne look to have mellowed into adulthood, mellowed into sophistication-- the sort that can almost leave a person feeling jealous. One imagines Pete Wiggs and Bob Stanley lounging around hotel bars in tailored suits, discussing real estate and drum programming. One imagines singer Sarah Cracknell lingering over wine at lunch with married friends, snapping up her stylish little pocketbook: ""Drat, they'll be expecting me at the studio, we're meant to be arranging woodwinds today."" One imagines parties in London where they cross paths with Rushdie. The image suits them well, and it's a logical destination after the past decade's travels. Was there ever a time when they didn't seem a bit jet-set? It's just that they kicked off seeming young, unmoneyed, thrift-store glamorous, ersatz fabulous: Half of the joy in their earliest records was clocking the ratty seams where their various sonic interests-- dance music breaks and baroque pop, acid synths and sixties swing, Soul II Soul and Bacharach-- collaged into song. If, these days, they seem to have slipped from thrift-store collage into the strictly upscale, it just might be because the joins have vanished from the music. This new album, more than anything they've produced yet, boils all of those impulses into one smooth, seamless thing-- a well-cut party dress that does the same work as those hipster separates. If any single word describes the results, it's ""quaint""-- deliberately quaint, and as charmingly quaint as the album's cover. Tales from Turnpike House is a concept record verging on a musical score, offering a day-in-the-life cycle about the residents of an outer-London housing estate. This being Saint Etienne, those lives are drawn in the same shades of retro-modernity as the music: Up-to-the-minute references sit side by side with a vibe that's all 1960s kitchen-sink English, brightly-colored and respectably working-class, Corn Flakes and teakettles. Morrissey spent half a career plumbing that vibe for its camp and its seediness, but Saint Etienne have no such intentions. Sun rises on the first track, and by the second, the residents are bustling around their breakfasts, each whistling individual parts of the building's ""Milkbottle Symphony"". Any American who's ever studied introductory French will recognize the mix: Those textbooks are forever full of cute, sophisticated college students, splitting their time between le discotheque, le picnic, and la maison. That same mix extends straight out into the music here. These songs create a space where nylon-stringed guitars and fluffy Free Design vocal harmonies mingle unawkwardly with well-styled house beats and synth swells. At times it sounds like the bucolic soundtrack from some sunny late-60s television documentary; at times it sounds like a dance club for the most well-adjusted people in the universe; and at its best-- say, ""A Good Thing"", or the buoyant, breezy disco of ""Stars Above Us""-- it sounds like both at once. All of which leaves it as the most fully-realized thing-- if not the most exciting one-- the band has released since 1994's Tiger Bay. It's like they've finally managed to make the rustic folk of ""Former Lover"" and the city strut of ""I was Born on Christmas Day"" inhabit the same track. This development may well make them even more of an ""acquired taste"" for the rock kids; it's a cozy little dream-world of soft, slick signifiers, and their new dives into arranging vocal harmonies give it yet another coat of storybook gloss. Same goes for anyone craving more of the chilly electro vibe that bubbled up on their last full length; this, more than ever, is the postcard baroque. When the composition here falters its way toward dullness, both groups might be justified. But when it's working, it's the hard kids' loss: This set lets the group cater more than ever to the shimmering chart-pop act they've never been afraid to be. Pop from a quainter and more self-consciously picturesque place than they-- or we-- will ever live, but slick, dreamy pop nonetheless. Where we live is important, too, as you may well guess from the concept. The one thing American listeners may never fully get out of Saint Etienne is the sheer wealth of cultural detail packed into their work; asking me to get into it may well be like asking Mongolians to explain Kevin Federline. This album, interestingly, gives you a better chance than ever to tap into it. These songs have characters voicing a ""Green Acres"" duet about whether it's worth moving to the country (""Relocate""), a bossa nova whisper about the fear of street crime (""Side Streets""), and a spoken wrap-up where people text-message around the changing neighborhood: The baker's has turned into a tanning salon, and the pub jukebox has given way to the staff's Red Hot Chili Peppers albums. A bonus EP gets even more provincial/universal, with a selection of ""child-friendly"" pastorals that break free into ultra-quaint storybook geography. The package, then: It's less about flash, less about excitement, and more about being good company-- in the same slowly-charming way that a favorite novel can be. A decent portion of the composition works out to be a long-term treat; even when it falters, it's got enough leafy-green musical vibes to last through the summer months. Calling it their ""best since Tiger Bay"" has the same meaningless vibe as putting the same line on folks like Tom Waits-- but depending on your temperament, there's some chance that it's true.","Another deliberately and charmingly quaint record from the London trio. Here they've slipped completely from thrift-store collage into the strictly upscale, the joins have vanished from the music, and they've boiled all of their impulses into one smooth, seamless thing.

The Dead 60s,The Dead 60s,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb513d197565213b15c/1:1/w_160/e4684e3d.jpg,2005-06-15 06:00:38,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2614-the-dead-60s/,BMG,"No, they're not a PC reincarnation of the Dead Kennedys-- try instead the Clash chewed up and spit out by an Orwellian FCC. While the members of Liverpool upstarts the Dead 60s clearly sleep with a copy of London Calling under their pillows, their music propagates the libertine Franz Ferdinandian mantra ""we just wanna make girls dance."" Not to say that a dearth of politics in music is necessarily damning, but without that sneer directed towards the powers-that-be, the Dead 60s take on reactionary bands like the Clash and Gang of Four mires in half-baked ska and paradoxically insouciant punk rock. In short, the Dead 60s may be as ill-equipped for the punk revival pantheon as they are for a spot on CNN's ""Crossfire"". Case in point, these guys are already rubbing elbows on tour with new wave charlatans the Killers and the Bravery. I won't arraign by association though, especially since first Dead 60s single, ""Riot Radio"", does itself in, reeking of stale minor chord progressions and the same hi-hat happy drumming that's sanctified dancing for klutzy white dudes since ""Somebody Told Me"". Yes, this song and others on the album have ""movement"" and ""energy"" and any other shibboleth your local DJ will spout out, but there's a troubling fear to deviate too far from the standardized ""punk"" sound. Perhaps as a reaction to their self-imposed musical limitations, the Dead 60s rebel by championing drinking, womanizing and nearly any other possible form of debauchery. Single ""Loaded Gun"" lusts for a femme fatal who's ""got a loaded gun pointed at me,"" but, while its art-funk virility shines as the album's standout, frontman Matt McManamon's uninspired lounge vocals fail to effectively play off the song's martini-cool 007 guitar riffs. Alcohol anthem ""Horizontal"" laments modern day vicissitudes with radio-friendly nihilism, climaxing with the drab line ""I wanna be horizontal."" McManamon's sour countenance gets downright comical on closer ""You're Not The Law"", where McManamon's petulant reggae wail flawlessly mimics Sublime's Brad Nowell. Despite the pea-brained lyrics and predictable songwriting, the Dead 60s at least sincerely appreciate their influences, as opposed to most revivalist poseurs who often appear to hate the bands they imitate. After all, the first thirty seconds of the album clearly establish the band's purpose-- to have a good time playacting as their rock idols. Even their name suggests an immutable focus on the past, and this self-titled debut certainly isn't bequeathing anything new to posterity. Hey, at least they're honest.","Liverpool upstarts apparently sleep with copies of London Calling under their pillows.

The Road Leads Where It's Led EP,The Secret Machines,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3975e6ef959693206a0/1:1/w_160/94d572aa.gif,2005-06-15 06:00:37,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7058-the-road-leads-where-its-led-ep/,Warner Bros.,"The new single from the Secret Machines' pounding 2004 debut and the title track for the dull follow-up EP, ""The Road Leads Where It's Led"", contains all the elements that make Texas trio's sound distinctive, albeit not unique. Josh Garza's military timing contrasts dramatically with Brandon Curtis's rumbling guitar and Ben Curtis's stoner keyboard atmospherics and coded-message lyrics create a strange and insistent urgency that's still fresh more than a year later. ""The Road Leads Where It's Led"" is easily the best song on its namesake EP, which collects one other original and four covers. The selling point for many listeners will most likely be the covers of Van Morrison, Barrett Strong (well, Bradford and Gordy), and Bob Dylan. Morrison's ""Astral Weeks"" starts promisingly enough, with a pendulum rhythm arcing between guitar and keyboards and Brandon Curtis delivering Morrison's mystical lyrics. Garza's drums add heft to the sound, and towards the end the instruments start reverberating trippily, as if they've actually gone astral. But the problem with ""Astral Weeks"" is the same problem that's more pronounced on ""Money (That's What I Want)"" and ""Girl From North Country"": The Secret Machines seem so restricted by the lyrical structures of these songs that the only deviations they can make from the originals are slowing the tempo and adding more tedious dynamics. ""Money"" and ""Girl from the North Country"" are both very slow and very long...but that's about it. They nearly triple the running times of their respective originals, but there's not much to them besides some foggy psychedelica to justify such lengths. And considering ""Money"" has historically had little compunction about its greediness, the Secret Machines could have turned the song into a biting and topical commentary on institutional avarice that would have fit perfectly on the conspiratorial Now Here Is Nowhere. But instead, there seems to be little meaning to the song beyond its stunt value. The Machines' version of Dylan's ""Girl from the North Country"" begins with as much promise as ""Astral Weeks"": a laser-light-show synth pierces the ambience before giving way to quiet pulses of sound that give the song its sense of gloomy foreboding. Later, an acoustic guitar plays so faintly it sounds like a 40-year-old echo of Dylan's. The song gently breaks as if building toward something big and majestic, but its structure is so closely and reverently tied to Dylan's lyrical progressions that the Machines cannot deviate from his song structure. It's entirely constructed around Ben Curtis's vocals, and the other instruments-- guitar and drums-- are relegated to supporting roles, whereas on Now Here Is Nowhere the trio traded off melodic lines among instruments for optimum drama. The band maintains a palpable tension for nine minutes, but it all comes to nothing-- the fog never lifts, the song remains shapeless. For a band that gets so many dogged comparisons to Pink Floyd, these are perhaps admirable, even necessary attempts to expose the breadth of their influences. But ultimately, these somewhat obvious choices don't really reflect much on the Machines' sonic palette. In fact, the original track ""Better Bring Your Friends"" and, to a lesser extent, their cover of Harmonia's ""De Luxe (Immer Weider)"" are the only two tracks on the EP that reveal new facets of the band. The EP's most obscure cover is also its most concise (shorter than the original) and in some ways its most faithful: Without playing note for note, ""De Luxe"" re-creates the original's rigid tempo, regimented rhythms, Doppler momentum, and studied repetition and suggests that the Machines have deeply absorbed Krautrock elements into their own sound, even if they don't refashion those elements into anything new on this cover. More fun and less academic, the Machines original ""Better Bring Your Friends"" is the true surprise here. It draws on their Texas influences to create an upbeat vibe that would go over well at Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnic. Even more crucially, there is no hint of awkwardness or hesitation: all of the sonic elements-- Garza's hoedown drumbeat, Ben Curtis's loose vocals and propulsive piano-- blend together fluidly and dramatically. If some of these songs are wrong turns, ""Better Bring You Friends"" gets them back on the road Now Here Is Nowhere started them along.","The title track is joined here by one other original and four covers.

At the Soundless Dawn,Red Sparowes,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31e5e6ef9596932058f/1:1/w_160/9cfa5388.jpg,2005-06-15 06:00:36,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6945-at-the-soundless-dawn/,Neurot,"Not surprisingly in a genre premised on stylistic choices that bear almost universally negative connotations, instrumental post-rockers lead a pretty thankless existence. Their music is slow, humorless, and uneventful. Looking for gimmicks? Try elsewhere. Though their live performances can be Voice-of-God loud, recorded sound has a disappointing, mellowing effect on bands like Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai, City of Caterpillar, and ambient-metal label Neurot interlopers Red Sparowes. Success stories are few. When Explosions in the Sky scored a big-budget Hollywood film, Friday Night Lights, it was a sort of backhanded compliment: The band, who'd theretofore propagated unwieldily large instrumentals, were sought after to make cool background noise. So how is a band to survive making such underappreciated, often derided, music? One way is to do what Red Sparowes do, which is infuse their lumbering instrumentals with idiosyncratic guitar licks that poach from forbidden genres. You know, those emphasizing concision, catchiness, and ease of digestion. At the Soundless Dawn isn't exactly pop. In fact, the album is all instrumental post-rock in its viscera, from the swollen, hour-plus runtime (avg. song = nine minutes) to the ponderous doses of reverb. But de-bone these meaty cuts and you'll find some unexpected stylizing. Froghopping discreetly from soggy new wave to ecclesiastic country twang, Red Sparowes find a way to the beat tedium inherent to their genus-- then ride it for so long that...are you paying attention? ""Mechanical Sounds Cascaded Through the City Walls and Everyone Reveled in Their Ignorance"" tops 11 minutes but rocks the silo for a too-brief spell, bending and sliding like a syrup-sipping Ry Cooder. But there's still those other 10 minutes to account for, and the build-up/comedown are the means that don't justify the ends. Somewhat-title track ""The Soundless Dawn Came Alive as Cities Began to Mark the Horizon"" sobs just fine without vocals, thanks, awaiting its emo (not emo) troubadour. (He never shows.) ""A Brief Moment of Clarity Before the Deafening Hum, But it Was Too Late"" flirts with awesome Unwound sewer grooves, but it's too good-natured to do any damage, dressing its sludgy privates in a Big Distorted Chorus. Red Sparowes treat their genre like a menial internship: It's entre to bigger, better things, right? Or maybe they really are passionate about instrumental post-rock. Beats filing, I guess. But at these lugubrious tempos-- and this album's interminable length-- listening is a lot like busy work: redundant and largely unrewarding.","Post-rockers infuse their lumbering instrumentals with idiosyncratic guitar licks poached from other genres.

Push Comes to Shove,M.E.D.,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35bc0084474cd0c3457/1:1/w_160/d5e77481.jpg,2005-06-15 06:00:35,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5652-push-comes-to-shove/,Stones Throw,"With a monotonous flow and wearisome lack of vocal presence, MED can't help but take a restless backseat to his debut album's impeccable production, which comes courtesy of Madlib, Oh No, J Dilla, and mega-watt stunner Just Blaze, moonlighting from his world-renowned heat-rocketeer dayjob to throw a slick stone of his own. Handling 10 of the album's 15 beats, the prolific Madlib takes the reigns and tosses off a steady stream of (relatively) clear-headed soul-bubble beats that offer welcome respite from his other more esoteric, hit-or-miss avant-personas. Meanwhile, the California MC unwittingly sabotages himself while attempting a hard-to-handle blend of Kweli-esque wordy consciousness and mainstream boast-a-licious chest-huffing but doesn't have the wisdom or swagger to pull off either convincingly. ""What U In It For?"" serves as a microcosm for the disc's failings. Madlib brother Oh No's pop-lock beat provides a head nod by way of its slithering synth bass playing off a high-end guitar flick and panning digital alarm, but MED tries to stuff too many syllables into the verses, dragging down the syncopated rhythm. It's no coincidence the hottest part of the track is the minute-long instrumental outro. Clearly lost when it comes to hooks (the record's best choruses are decidedly MED-less), the rapper answers the track's titular question with a lame refrain featuring sleepwalking lines like, ""The beats and the rhymes, streets and the grind, I hustle for mines."" MED nearly matches his high-caliber music from time to time. Singer Noelle recreates ""Special""'s original Erykah Badu-sampling hook and her flighty voice adds a lightness that justly contrasts her partner's dense lyricism. ""We have to do it big or like a short fuse we soon to detonate and blow up for raising the stakes,"" he theorizes, deftly juggling the ideas of under and over ground rap as perky piano chords drive the melody while a slew of chimes and undulating hums go lengths to uphold Madlib's instant-vintage reputation. Sounds of bongs being hit and tokers coughing can't ruin ""Never Give U Up"", an effervescent horn-laden ode to marijuana. (Yes, Madlib's behind this one too.) The hook's ba-do-be scat sample yields Push's most natural high, a feel-good anthem for hash-hounds worldwide. The more commercial-ready fare is intriguing considering Stones Throw's unique place in the hip-hop universe, but it ultimately disappoints. Just Blaze joint ""Get Back"" is an uncharacteristically svelte exercise in minimalism, with swooning strings and funky bongos subtly boosting the bump. But the producer so overshadows his MC, he's even awkwardly referenced in the track's chorus (""Just Blaze where you at?""). For an album that could desperately use more lightweight guest shots for simple variety's sake, Push is largely devoid of such fresh air. But it's A Tribe Called Quest and Fugees producer and part-time MC Diamond D's playful verse on the hyped-up ""Pressure"" that crystallizes Push's failed potential. The hip-hop vet growls semi-corny lines like, ""And I'm grindin' so you won't see me often/ I'm tryin' to make 6 million like Stevie Austin,"" but, unlike MED, his goofy, nonchalant style sells the lines and, for a few seconds, you get an impression of what this album full of casually spectacular beats would sound like fronted by an MC who could do them justice.","The emcee has production from Madlib, Oh No, J Dilla, and Just Blaze on this Stones Throw release.

In Your Honor,Foo Fighters,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf65e6ef95969323193/1:1/w_160/f80dc46f.jpg,2005-06-15 06:00:34,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3149-in-your-honor/,Sony,"Having publicly declared In Your Honor, the Foo Fighters' fifth full-length since their start in 1995, the Physical Graffiti of the band's oeuvre-- hence, the Foos' definitive artistic statement-- frontman Dave Grohl understands the sudden need for gravity. Now he sings with his eyes closed-- earnest and calm, face pressed to the microphone, hair plastered to his forehead: the two-disc In Your Honor is Grohl at his most pensive, purposefully distanced from his all-American prankster persona, attempting to build a legacy that extends beyond the shadows of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain, past well-publicized star-turns in other people's bands. In Your Honor is Dave Grohl claiming ground. Sadly, the record suffers from that largeness-- reportedly recorded in a warehouse, its double disc conceit (one half is hard rock, the other acoustic) is heavy handed, the segregation too deliberate. Grohl's ""metal"" voice periodically strains, like he's concentrating too hard on forefronting his emotional intensity; likewise, the softer tracks can sound stifled, like their proprietor is holding something back, curbing his urges for the sake of classification. Disc One features loads of thundering guitars and manic drum breakdowns, classic Foo structures (brash verse, anthemic chorus) and aggressively contemplative lyrics. Single ""Best of You"" muses furiously about the frailty of the human heart, asking clunky questions (""Were you born to resist, or be abused?/ Is someone getting the best of you?""), Grohl's chest-screams barely seeping through his bandmates' soupy guitars. The song fades out where it should climax, bleeding into ""DOA"", a twisty, death-obsessed cut (""It's a shame we have to disappear/ No one's getting out of here/ Alive"") with docile vocals (that almost sound as if they were snatched from another song.) Meanwhile, the 70s rock-infused ""Resolve"", a dynamic call for tenacity, is memorable-- but still weirdly reminiscent of nearly every Foo Fighters single ever shot to radio. The big problem is that the Foo Fighters are telling the exact same story, over and over: heavy guitars, Grohl's bitter, self-directed hollers, loud drums, catchy choruses. At their best, the Foo Fighters are muscular and unrelenting, pushing in all the right spots-- but Disc One still confirms an undeniable stasis. Ten years have passed, and the band isn't evolving: This is where In Your Honor's big curveball-- the acoustic second disc-- attempts to make up for all the retreads. It succeeds, to an extent. The bossanova-tinged ""Virginia Moon"" (which features guest vocals from Starbucks' own Norah Jones) proffers brushed cymbals, flamenco guitar, and tinkling piano bits-- it sounds more like a classic Norah Jones track than anything the Foos have ever recorded, but the band's sudden break in character is also intriguing: With its jazzy, coffee-table lyrics (""Sweetest invitation/ Breaking the day in two/ Feeling like I do/ Virginia moon, I wait for you tonight""), ""Virginia Moon"" allows Grohl to croon gently into the night sky, singing lullabies to an army of dudes driving home from their girlfriend's houses in their Honda Accords. Barely breaking a whisper, Jones and Grohl's respective vocals blend effortlessly; surprisingly, it's Jones who adds a bit of grit to the track, her grainy murmurs sneaking texture into Grohl's squeaky-clean pipes. The docile ""Miracle"" features a cameo by Led Zeppelin's own John Paul Jones, although its gentle piano and sweet acoustic strums aren't terribly suggestive of sharp Zep bluster. ""Cold Day in the Sun"" sees drummer Taylor Hawkins assuming lead vocals, steering the Foo Fighters dangerously close to adult contemporary mush; ""Friend of a Friend"", a Nirvana-era Grohl original (supposedly written about his former bandmates) is eerily quiet, just strums and voice, Grohl's vocals controlled and determined, pushing his way through. That unwavering restraint provides one of the most emotionally honest moments on In Your Honor-- listen close, and you can almost hear Grohl's face going white. In Your Honor, like most Foo Fighters records, is sterile and controlled; there is never any threat of dissolution. While Grohl's musicianship and charisma are certainly a credit to any project he participates in, he still lacks the volatility typically inherent to life-shaking art. Nirvana felt wobbly, fragile, and fleeting, Queens of the Stone Age pound deranged, Probot are full-on bananas: The Foo Fighters are strong, neat, and clean. So we wonder: Can a steady, hard-working everydude from northern Virginia make transcendent art? Sure. Does Dave Grohl? Sometimes.","This 2xCD cordons off the rockers from the acoustic tracks; Dave Grohl calls it his band's Physical Graffiti, and here he's at his most pensive, purposefully distanced from his all-American prankster persona.

"Day Late, Dollar Short",Thrones,by: Cory D. Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a0b1335d7bf16990c2/1:1/w_160/f362f2ae.jpg,2005-06-14 06:00:42,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8045-day-late-dollar-short/,Southern Lord,"Joe Preston's résumé reads like the tracklisting for the ultimate sludge metal compilation. In the early 90s, he was a member of drone metal pioneers Earth, a band he left to join the Melvins. In more recent times he's recorded with Sunn 0))), collaborated with ex-members of Karp in the Whip, and toured with High on Fire. Thrones is his solo project in the truest sense of the term: For most recordings, Preston is the only performer. Day Late, Dollar Short collects 19 rare tracks stretching from 1994 through 2001; many of these songs originally appeared on 7""'s and comps, while several have never been released. With few exceptions, the tracks on Day Late, Dollar Short fall into two categories. Behind door number one is the bulk of the material, and it's like the sonic equivalent of watching a building collapse in slow motion. The bass is down-tuned and distorted almost beyond comprehension, the slow, disjointed beat is provided by a drum machine, and Preston's vocals are mumbled, warped, and warbled. Door number two hides the even more bizarre: vaudeville-esque organ drones with show-tune like vocal melodies, warped piano tinkerings, and Theremin-inspired, sci-fi guitar lines. The album's opener, 1994's ""The Suckling"", is a solid introduction. The bass stretches from note to note, shifting constantly but rarely locating a melody. Conversely, ""Senex"", also from 1994, is built almost entirely around two rapidly repeating bass notes. There is no chorus, and the mumbled vocals are indecipherable. But to focus only on elements such as melody, chorus, verse, tune, and beat is to miss the point entirely; like many of Preston's projects, Thrones pursue sonic texture rather than a catchy hook. The challenging nature of the music is that the texture is almost entirely bass guitar. Even when the tempo increases, the emphasis remains on pummeling bass lines and acid-trip vocals. Unfortunately, therein lies the problem. Relying so heavily on one instrument means these songs often lack individuality. The tempo might change, but by the end of the disc it's hard to avoid feeling like you've listened to the same song five or six times. The non-bass-centric tracks come across as mostly throwaways. It's difficult to imagine anyone getting excited and cranking the volume up on ""Silvery Colorado"", a traditional tune once recorded by the Carter Family. Needless to say, the version here isn't exactly traditional. And although the gloomy ""Epicus Doomicus Bumpitus"" works as some sort of funeral march from the church of the damned, its follow up, ""Piano Handjob"", sounds, well, about like its title. But these tracks and others break up the monotony of bass-on-bass love, giving the listener a brief respite from having his ears violated. The few tracks that break the mold are the collection's shining moments. Three covers stand out-- Ultravox's ""Young Savage"", Blue Öyster Cult's ""Black Blade"", and the Who's ""A Quick One, While He's Away"". ""Young Savage"" is a driving post-punk anthem, complete with live percussion provided by Spinanes and Built to Spill drummer Scott Plouf. ""Black Blade"" is a faithful rendition of the original, with the closest thing to singing this album can claim. Most interesting, however, is ""A Quick One"", which the liner notes explain was recorded for what was meant to be a split 7"" with Fast Forward, Sinking Body, and the Catholic Church, where each band recorded a section of the song. Beginning with vocal harmonies courtesy of a little pitch shifting, then continuing with a synth lead and robotic vocals, the section covered by Thrones is a fun departure from the doom and gloom found elsewhere on the disc.","Nineteen rare tracks recorded between 1994 and 2001 by Joe Preston (Earth, Melvins).

Terrorhawk,Bear Vs. Shark,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48a5e6ef959693208c8/1:1/w_160/d9e69fb1.jpg,2005-06-14 06:00:41,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1163-terrorhawk/,Equal Vision,"Post-hardcore is a slippery genre. If emo is commonly defined as ""we know it when we hear it,"" maybe post-hardcore is ""we know it when we can't hear anything after hearing it."" But that's too easy; lots of music is loud. Maybe post-hardcore is what happens when people who are into hooks and melodies get into heavier styles like punk, metal, and hardcore. Post-hardcore kids listen to classic Metallica and hear the melody beneath the mayhem, the pop in the apoplexy. They listen to emo and imagine what those wobbly arpeggios would sound like with some real balls in the dynamic shifts, some buffness in the chordage. You can hear some latter-day Wire in Bear Vs. Shark's linear, deeply textured riffs; there's some early Mission of Burma in their pronounced loud/soft dynamics and fist-pumping rhythmic maneuvers. But beneath Terrorhawk's ripped chords, frantic tempos and dudefaced vocals, there's a dewy-eyed indie rock record whimpering to be let out. Not that letting it out would've been advisable-- as it stands, the raw fury and insane energy level of the album stampedes right over the brain and booms down the spine. Deeper than it initially sounds, Terrorhawk will send you scrambling for a few points of reference before you zero in on the right one. Trail of Dead? Not quite. Constantines? Closer...Soon it starts making sense how the ballads sit comfortably with the screamers, the uninflected melodic vocals with the shredded-larynx ones, the brainy leads with the knuckle-dragging chords: This is the spiritual heir to Cursive's Domestica, an indie-hardcore record that's interested in locating the violence inherent in the lullaby and the euphony in the scorched-earth anthem. Terrorhawk starts off totally beefcake with ""Catamaran"". Galloping, muted chords with a little hitch for texture leap out first, but there are some delicate harmonics chiming behind them. The vocals and drums fall into step for a moment, but it's like they just can't friggin' wait to let loose, and soon the song's careening like it was launched from a catapult. ""5, 6 Kids"" changes the tone right away-- with a tortured lead and ragged vocals, it's like an iron maul dragging on an iron floor, heavy and sparking. And ""Baraga Embankment"" is an honest-to-God piano ballad that, even after the distorted chords kick in, has already tipped Bear Vs. Shark's indie-rocking hand. I'll be straight with you, I'm not usually into anything deemed post-hardcore. But Terrorhawk grabbed me by the short hairs from the first track, and hasn't let go since.","Deeply textured riffs, pronounced loud/soft dynamics, and fist-pumping rhythmic maneuvers from the post-hardcore band.

Nomo,NOMO,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9819d034d5c69bf5238/1:1/w_160/ea645824.jpeg,2005-06-14 06:00:40,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5915-nomo/,Ypsilanti,"Michigan is not necessarily the first place that comes to mind when one thinks of scorching-hot Afropop, and yet here I am, listening to Nomo, the self-titled debut from a troupe of 16 Ypsilantians (17 if you count producer Warn Defever of His Name is Alive, who chips in some wah guitar). Led by multi-instrumentalist Elliot Bergman, Nomo play a heavy, largely faithful descendant of Fela Kuti & Tony Allen's classic Afrobeat sound that leans more toward the jazz side of the style than the funk side, with the occasional blast of distorted guitar or flourish from a flute. Defever's horn sound is deliciously crunchy and deep, with special emphasis on Dan Bennett's blazing baritone sax, but the production leaves a lot of air between those arrangements and the rhythm section, which consists of multiple guitars, bass, two drummers, and assorted percussionists. All those people make for quite a solid wall of sound, but the music is surprisingly nuanced, with the band able to pull back and just let the Rhodes piano blanket the groove with pillowy chords or allow a solo to breathe. Most of the band members get their shot in the spotlight at some point on the record, and they all shine, though some more brightly than others. Bennett in particular cuts loose on ""Busy"", wrenching a twisting, growling solo from his horn. Bergman's horn themes provide ample jumping-off points for his band mates' improvisations, and they carry the mostly instrumental album nicely, offering a lot of ear-grabbing moments to balance the solos and the occasional jammy tangent. The only vocal original on the album, ""Moving in Circles"", features one of Nomo's heaviest, nastiest horn charts and then asks poor bassist Jamie Register to compete with it, a task I don't envy. She does well by it, though, opting for a smoothly soulful delivery that acts as a sort of counterpoint to the thundering horns. She also does a great job on the band's sped-up cover of Segun Bucknor's awesome, funky Afro-soul song ""La La La"". It's only one album, but this record places Nomo rather firmly near the head of an emerging pack of Afrobeat revival bands, led by New York City's Antibalas along with a few other established acts like Akoya and Kokolo. It's a good bet that anyone who digs Ted Sirota's Soul Rebels will love this, given the emphasis on jazz, and naturally, there's the affinity with Fela, so Afrobeat and Afro-jazz afficionados are encouraged to give a listen. Anyone else who just wants to dance can come along, too.","Warn Defever and a cast of thousands go...Afropop?

""Fire Fire"", for instance, is transcendent, epic, gorgeous dance music, a dizzy, sticky helium chorus over a bleepy soca synth line and disco-call whistles, so fast that it seems ready to spin out of control at any second. So it goes on Unknown Language, the group's second LP. From the urgent clarion-call staccato keyboards of ""Hey Ladies"" to the ethereal choir-synths and impossibly heavy drum hits of ""No Way Jose"" to the handclappy playground Coolie Dance chanting of the title track, nearly every track on the LP is a glittering and giddy. The production has an omnivorous reach, squeezing in frisky, heavy Latin piano and reggaeton drums on ""She Hotter"" and howling, wordless Middle-Eastern chanting on ""Neck Breakers"". And the members' voices, ranging from the throaty, gravelly Bounty Killer-esque growl of Flexx to the creamy, squeaky high croon of Bay-C, weave into a fluid, seamless harmonic tapestry on breathtaking chorus after breathtaking chorus. These songs, almost without exception, are about girls and partying, but party music is rarely this urgently, transcendently joyous. When cognitive dissonance does raise its head, it's on ""Wah Gwan"", a track that with a greasy, squelchy Booker T organ and a clickety-clack drum pattern, seems to be a homeland-pride anthem at first but turns out to be a lament about Jamaica's epidemic violence: ""Me no like wah gwan/ Too much innocents are dead; wah gwan?"" And the floating, angelic ""Footprints"", which rests on acoustic guitars and one of the old-school drop beats currently popular in Jamaica, is something like T.O.K.'s version of TLC's ""Waterfalls"", a sad, simple elegy for kids killed by random violence and rendered homeless by abject poverty in a poor, dangerous country. If the party needs to slow down for a minute, it needs to slow down for a track like this.","The best pop band in Jamaica hope to follow Sean Paul, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man into the U.S. charts.

Full-on body music's great, sure, but so is porno, and with that shit I'd much rather wax new flesh than drag my stylus off the same old 10-second loop. Same time, Intelligent Body Music's as much a nightmare as Intelligent Anal, both a prefab excuse for pleasure-lack. So we're stuck in this immediacy=better rut, when really the best stuff cross-genre-- cross-platform, cross-media-- has instant funk, but with enough tricks for prolonged appeal. Liking We Are Monster is easy. Isolée aren't bangers but they groove hard enough; melodies are pretty but most times we have to look for them (no lead vox or riff jihad per se). Tracks aren't afraid to be songs (""Face B""), and songs aren't afraid to be tracks (""Jelly Baby / Fish""). Everything's pleasant in other words, non-threatening like the cutesy-est Morr Music lullaby, but physical enough that you could get away with some great normal-person dancing. There are guitar sounds on a few tracks too, if that's important (""Today"" sounds like ""Do You Realize?""), and traceable horizontal A-->B trajectory in songs with actual movements and quantifiable progress. No need for all the ""it's about size! it's about expansion!"" apologies people make for their favorite loops. As for loving this record-- letting it problematize itself with spins and learning to let it offend-- well, We Are Monster has the depth if you have the time. Yep, here's a fun record that's a work-for-it, in-the-details record, too. Behind the choked-vocals groove of, say, ""Enrico"" are countless micro-surprises (check how the kicks break down differently each turnaround, or how the downbeat finally drops deceptively mid-bar instead of on the loop's head), structured flips with chess-like anticipation (the guitar-like scratches function percussively at first, their color stuck in overtones until the song needs them in full), and avalanching momentum not from Isolée stuffing ideas half-baked, but from letting the seeds of lines grow, branch out, and tangle. Not sure we can talk of ""Golden Age IDM"" or even ""Golden Age Techno"" yet, but something like the Copeland-does-Glam gem ""Schrapnell"" seems so effortless, breathes so carefree, years from now crits might accuse it of sounding timeless-- maybe even of being so. The rest of the tracks have their own self-revealing logic, obeying the beat but never in dependency to it. Honestly, you could drop the drum sounds off ""Madchen mit Hase"" and the song would still kill a floor, the rhythms of its composite parts boasting good spine, serving the melody before decorating the dancefloor. No gesture's incidental; the simplest blip plays for both a greater purpose and its own passing punchline. Even the second-trackiest number, ""Do Re Mi"", fronts a perplexing guitar jingle so it can alley-oop with drones of the same progression and a goofy italo-disco melody of 180-degree mood change, then the polar-opposite timbre. These songs are well-poised and well-developed and terrifyingly autonomous-- so much so I'm afraid they're no longer Isolée's anymore. On that note: Yeah, while I wish We Are Monster was an Album w/Overarching Concerns and Worldview, not just a Bunch Of Sweet Similar-Sounding Stand-Alone Tracks, I'm also convinced that in fact, a worldview is there, and probably an exciting one at that. I just haven't cracked one yet-- or just won't be able to. ","The classics kid in me craves noble grandeur-- craft-happy shit with more than meets the rods and cones, less is ...

"I Thought I Was Over That: Rare, Remixed, and B-Sides",Lali Puna,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc80abf31b7dc7155d27/1:1/w_160/b423a389.gif,2005-06-13 06:00:47,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4649-i-thought-i-was-over-that-rare-remixed-and-b-sides/,Morr,"Something was wrong with Lali Puna's last album. The band shares associations with the Notwist-- a hometown, members, brothers-- but up until that last record, their roles were still distinct. The Notwist were the ""rock"" ones, a hardcore outfit that turned to grand, electronically-sculpted, occasionally-boring indie; Lali Puna, on the other hand, dove a lot more fully into the electronics. Yes, they played like a band, and plenty of their material brought on the bass for some proper Germanic pulse. But their most distinctive moments-- as of 2001's Scary World Theory-- were the ones where the attenuated tick of a spaced-out beat popped through the mix, or singer Valerie Trebeljahr was left humming over a minimalist bed of synths. This is what we came to expect: Simple hums and airy whispers and sleepy like you wouldn't believe. And then last year's Faking the Books, an album that had them trending nearly as rock-like as the Notwist. Not a bad move, market-wise, considering the success of the latter's Neon Golden. If you're anything like me, though, you made a bunch of unpleasant noises and took a pass. And if you're anything like me, you might be somewhat happier with I Thought I was Over That, which collects enough remixes, remixing, and rarities to fit with the mechanized camp where-- according to those of us who are still reading this review-- they probably belong. Just try not to remember that they're all collected snapshots from the band's past. Not to say that it's all super-wonderful; some tracks are worth it, others aren't. The surprise is that it's as cohesive as it is, with remixers and remixes alike plumbing the same lines of soft-edged, computer-processed home-listening lullabies. Something about Lali Puna's full-band sound has always kept them distinct from their closest compu-pop cousins-- say, Styrofoam, Ulrich Schnauss, Dntel-- but fans of that cadre will find plenty here to like, assuming they haven't already snatched up the Morr Music releases a lot of these tracks hail from. Nineteen tracks, and they all at least sound gorgeous. Dntel gets a softened, vocal-free treatment of ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan""; it works even better now than in 2001, with its warm tones sounding something like the memory of a years-old favorite. Tamborello returns the favor with a Dntel remix of ""Faking the Books"", and an even better trade happens with Andy Weatherall's Two Lone Swordsmen project. They dub out ""Nin-com-pop"", pulling the Ultimate Remix Trick of changing the chords and leaving the vocal with a whole new character. Lali Puna lend the Swordsmen's ""It's Not the Worst I've Looked"" their usual combination of humming synths and clean guitar. Anyone who missed Morr Music's compilation of Slowdive covers can use this to catch up on Lali Puna's version of ""40 Days"", a head-nodding whisper of a shoegazer classic. Culling from Morr also offers the album's highlight, an atypically sinister collaboration with Bomb the Bass called ""Clear Cut""-- plus two EP tracks, and another whispering cover of Giorgio Moroder and Philip Oakey's ""Together in Electric Dreams"". The second half of the collection-- Lali Puna remixed-- skews even further into the machines, with Boom Bip revving ""Micronomic"" into a race of acoustic guitars, To Rococo Rot getting all blippy-baroque on ""Grin and Bear,"" and Alias and Sixtoo both letting some foreign sound buzz in contrast through the backgrounds of their contributions. Which is what we're looking for, right? That old warm-and-sleepy Lali Puna vibe suffuses everything here. Anyone miffed by the turn on Faking the Books should be pleased with the handy look back this collection represents. And anyone miffed by nothing at all-- anyone up for some of that Morr Music product that doesn't just sound like Ida with some IDM beats-- will find this a pretty decent return on the ear-candy investment; not a lot of motion, but more than enough soft sound to sink into.","Remixes, rarities, and B-sides comp from the Morr staples.

The People of and Their Verses,Despistado,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb7feb335119a49eca51/1:1/w_160/4850b6c9.gif,2005-06-13 06:00:46,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2563-the-people-of-and-their-verses/,Jade Tree,"Ultra-hyper Saskatchewan spaz-rockers Despistado (that's ""confused"" in Spanish) may have prematurely disbanded, but they leave little to be disappointed about. The foursome's hype was glowing white-hot after 2004's splendid The Emergency Response EP, but just a year later their career fizzled out like a bum Fourth of July sparkler, too intense and searing to sustain itself. A year of rigorous touring rendered their internal relationships as jagged and volatile as their staple post-punk sound, and by January 2005 the band was champing at the bit just for Jade Tree to digitally release their full length in late spring. Fortunately, this strife hardly taints the consistent, clockwork precision of The People of and Their Verses. For a band with their hands around each other's throats, Despistado manage to maintain breakneck tempos and tortuous song structures with the exactitude of prog but the immediacy and intimacy of punk. Whether or not the band knew this would be their last recording is debatable, but the album displays an undeniable prescience. There's a concerted effort to run the gamut between loud and soft, melodic and raucous, proto-punk and screamo, as if to leave no stone unturned. As a result, the LP fails to reproduce the incredibly dense and immaculately threaded string of ideas that decorated Despistado's EP, but the blemishes are far from glaring. Headbanging opener ""Burning House"" sets a jolting tone early as frontman Dagan Harding and guitarist Leif Thorseth crash guitar riffs into each other beneath Harding's stratospheric howl, which uncannily resembles Cedric Bixler pre-Geddy Lee posturing. ""If Relationships a Construct, Then I'm a Construction Worker"" redeems its pretentiously indie title with a pinpoint central riff intricate enough to challenge even virtuosos the Advantage or Pretty Girls Make Graves. Okay, not to blow my riff load here, but just gimme one more-- the jaw-dropping ""Victim"". Bend-happy Thorseth struggles to keep his strings on the guitar until he and Harding fire intersecting raga riffs over a frenetic chorus. Despistado stretch their talents thin, however, on mid-tempo numbers that fumble for the epic hook needed in justifying their length and lack of urgency. Melody isn't Harding's bread and butter, and some choruses fall flat without sufficient guitar and bass complementing. Regardless, the band exudes enough vigor to gloss over said weaknesses, most of which likely stem from their self-destructive work schedule in 2004. Although longevity is a commodity in the screamo/post-punk scene (see Cap'n Jazz, At the Drive-In, Sunny Day Real Estate, et al), this album, and to a greater extent Despistado's career, is sadly truncated before the brink of greatness.","Final document from the ultra-hyper Saskatchewan spaz-rockers.

Lady Fantasy EP,Jason Forrest,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be8a5e6ef9596932327b/1:1/w_160/b12c88e5.jpg,2005-06-13 06:00:45,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3291-lady-fantasy-ep/,Sonig,"A certain tackiness defines Jason Forrest. There is the obvious (his label is called CockRockDisco), the explicit (his Web site is infested with photos of Carter Administration-era soirees at the Playboy Mansion and various pics of rollerdiscos and bitchin' decaled vans), to the baffling (his retired moniker of Donna Summer). Forrest typically perverts breakcore techno as the new prog. Many of his fired shots are peppered with samples of Frank Frazetta-painted Guitar God solos, breakbeat arraignments bloated with impatient ideas, and an overwhelming sense that everything was bought on discount at the Goodwill record bins. However, Forrest is still an entertaining bastid who can provoke chuckles, furrowed eyebrows, and an unironic appreciation of trash. Case in point is how he mined the funkiest breakbeats from Alex Van Halen's trapkit in Tigerbeat6's sadly overlooked Revenge of the Fight Club 12"". Plus, a balding, Caucasian Jersey boy who named himself after disco's greatest Diva\xAA is almost criticism-proof. Forrest's four tunes on Lady Fantasy include departures and pushes of his spattergore breaks taken to their self-immolating logic. Most notable is how Forrest gives the listener breathing space with his opening ambient-drone piece, ""The Work Ahead of Us"". David Grubbs marinates the song with guitar feedback, which enriches a rather mediocre synth ballad ailed by lackluster melodies. Despite the singes of distortion by its end, the song does not give a promising direction for Forrest, Which is why the ultra-violence of the following title track is welcome. He first begins by looping a classic Camelot-prog break that then gets cut off by a drum machine sputtering on its last fumes of gas and failing to launch into a groove. The absurdity is divine. ""The Lure of You"" is one of Forrest's best moments; he brings in Margareth Kamerer to sing some Cotton Belt roadhouse-blues while he hypnotizes with a mind-locking disco beat and a giddy new wave riff that seems stolen from Prince and the Revolution. Quite startling. Closer ""Sperry and Foil"" is nearly as intriguing. Throughout its eight minutes, a snake charming, Egyptian Lover-style electro-funk jaunts morphs into a Maypole-dancing techno. A sublime moment quietly arises midway as melancholic jazz causes the song to sit in a corner and gaze around the room as if appreciating its last moments of life on earth. And then it's back to the Maypole. Overall, the juvenile delirium that trademarks Forrest is slightly defied. Let's hope that he surprises us when his new LP drops this fall.","Breakcore maven and former Donna Summer slightly matures with the help of David Grubbs and some Cotton Belt-disco.

The World and Everything in It,The Oranges Band,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45bea9e61561daa8121/1:1/w_160/f4831b1e.jpg,2005-06-13 06:00:44,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6112-the-world-and-everything-in-it/,Lookout!,"The Oranges Band cover all their bases with the title of their fourth record, The World and Everything in It. While their music stays within tight constraints, the lyrics touch upon waves, mountains, open air, outer space, drug cities, talking sharks, and being punk enough to get kicked out of your house downtown-- all in about 39 minutes. Vocalist/guitarist Roman Kuebler's lyrics won't be the first thing you'll notice, however. The band's most distinguishing trait is Kuebler's formal, mannered singing, sounding like an pre-rock crooner or (oh boy) an angst-free Rob Dickinson. Along with the vintage tones from their sparse acoustic strumming and fuzzy guitar lines, his voice gives their power pop a touch of '50s garage-rock and doo-wop, enhancing the album's lazy summer feel and keeping one foot charmingly out of time. ""Believe"" is an curious opener, merging a steady rock rhythm with twists in melody and a few bursts of Hammond organ, but the two ""wave"" songs are early highlights. ""Ride the Wild Wave"" moves on galloping eighth notes and falsetto backing vocals as Kuebeler sings of catching the elusive wave from Endless Summer and riding it around the world. ""Ride the Nuclear Wave"", on the other hand, might be the album's most spirited performance. While it may take two or three listens to seep in, there's an irresistible head-bobbing melody to be found in its ringing single-note guitar line and fantastical lyrics. While the band constrains themselves to classic sounds, there's enough small surprises to give The World and Everything in It the variety it needs. ""Believe"" and the light picking of ""Drug City"" divert from the 4/4 guitar-and-drums arrangements, and the title track adds irregular stabs of organ and echo-chamber vocals to a southern blues shuffle, changing the atmosphere nicely. The nod to ""Rumble Blues"" before the speeding chords of ""Mountain"" or the staccato strumming seconds before ""Atmosphere"" kicks in are simple, effective tricks. The Oranges Band's playing is impressive but never flashy, and the melodies are inviting without being cloying. The World And Everything In It is a perfect summer afternoon record, quietly and capably flowing from Track 1 through 12 without a misstep.","Lookout!'s answer to the Shins.

Another Day on Earth,Brian Eno,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc87c0084474cd0c2aec/1:1/w_160/69c9301a.gif,2005-06-13 06:00:43,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2808-another-day-on-earth/,Hannibal,"In my mind Brian Eno's ambient music is completely separate from his vocal work-- so much so that I can in hazier moments forget that one man was responsible for both ""Lantern Marsh"" and ""Third Uncle"". It's not difficult to hear how Eno's ideas find their way into whatever he's working on, but when you're debating what to play it's always either ""I'm in the mood for vocal Eno"" or ""I'm in the mood for ambient Eno."" The twin box sets he released in the early 90s were split along the same line, so obviously the man himself draws a similar distinction. Though he's steadily produced instrumental music over the past 20 years, Eno's only pop release during this time has been the 1990 collaboration with John Cale, Wrong Way Up. Good album, and it was particularly fun to hear him apply to his own music all the production tricks (bass guitar high in the mix, doubled, tripled, and quadrupled vocals, etc.) he'd been using with other bands over the previous decade. Now, 15 years and a clutch of instrumental albums later, Eno returns to songs with Another Day on Earth. The record starts beautifully with ""This"", a mantra-like melody with a vaguely West African rhythm that sounds very much along the lines of Wrong Way Up's ""Spinning Away"". It's an ideal first song-- catchy, relaxed, and expansive-- with Eno in fine voice and multi-tracked to the point where it seems almost rude not to sing along. It's not a stage-setting opener, however, and as the album wears on it becomes clear that ""This"" is by far the best track. One problem is that the sound on Another Day on Earth is lush to the point of distraction. It's almost as though Eno is hampered by his undeniable studio mastery -- he knows how to make so many beautiful sounds it would be a shame not to include them. Though he has in the past relied on chance operations to give his music an unpredictable and organic quality (""Honor thy mistake as a hidden intention,"" reads one of his Oblique Strategy cards) Another Day on Earth is produced to within an inch of its life, with layers of intricate detail and the most ethereal synth washes imaginable. Still, overproduced or not, there is pleasure in sitting back and letting Eno's sound wash over you. One highlight is ""How Many Worlds"", which begins and with a simple acoustic guitar strum that Eno sings over and then adds is a plaintive string arrangement that weaves around wafts of electronic drone and builds to a powerful climax. The chord stabs on ""Going Unconscious"" (which is essentially instrumental, with bits of female vocals vaguely reminiscent of Laurie Anderson) remind me a lot of the palette from Thursday Afternoon, and the bells that tinkle throughout add an effective tension. The melodies throughout Another Day on Earth are simple, which only occasionally works to the record's advantage. ""And Then So Clear"" is basic but true, though it will alienate some because Eno pitches his voice up an octave with what may be the same robotic AutoTune Cher used on ""Believe"". Leaving aside for a moment my affection for Cher's biggest hit, Eno's choice of processing suits both his voice and the song, turning what could have been nothing more than new age drift into a moving and fragile robotic lullaby. As if to illustrate the point about the vocal processing, the later song ""Under"" has the exact same melody as ""And Then So Clear"", this time sung by a small multracked chorus of Enos, and it's not nearly as powerful. ""This"" is the album's only track that isn't either a ballad or an amorphous moodscape that happens to have vocals. In terms of overall feel Another Day on Earth sounds like Eno's 90s ambient work bent slightly to fit into a song-oriented format. The dualistic vocal/ambient Eno filing scheme doesn't work with this one, which is refreshing in its way. But unfortunately Another Day on Earth is a decent album at best.",,6.1,
Discover a Lovelier You,Pernice Brothers,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03dea9e61561daa450d/1:1/w_160/7667c51d.jpg,2005-06-12 06:00:52,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6241-discover-a-lovelier-you/,Ashmont,"No one ever walked out of the Sistine Chapel praising Michelangelo for his ""craftsmanship."" Indeed, the surest sign of craft is its inconspicuousness. All art is artifice, yeah, but great art, even at its most self-referential, transcends mathematic precision to touch the soul. Over the first three Pernice Brothers albums, singer/songwriter Joe Pernice gathered quiet acclaim for his lush, orchestral guitar-pop-- and his supposedly immaculate, Brian Wilson-informed songcraft. On fourth studio outing, Discover a Lovelier You, the former Scud Mountain Boys bandleader listens too well to his supporters, manufacturing plenty of textbook ""pretty melodies"" that turn out to be pretty forgettable. June release date notwithstanding, the Pernices' latest is not a summer record. Sure, Discover a Lovelier You offers more of the 1970s light-rock sheen of 2003's Fourth-of-July-fronted Yours, Mine & Ours. Here, though, Pernice borrows the cold distance of '80s Anglo-pop hinted at on earlier songs like ""Sometimes I Remember"", and follows the lead of fellow Smiths-enamored former alt-country troubadours Ryan Adams (circa 2003's EP-twofer-turned-LP Love Is Hell) and Josh Rouse (particularly on this year's Nashville). Then there's Pernice's usual cryptic melancholy. And, uh, all those lyrics about ice and snow. Those lyrics: I could always see the ""craft"" in Pernice's genteel, Left Banke-inspired melodies, but when it comes to words he's typically received more praise than deserved, maybe because he's got an MFA (whoopedy-doo!). Pernice too often traffics in turgid phrases rather than complete thoughts, epitomized in the omg wtf chorus of ""My So-Called Celibate Life"": ""It's a short slide down/ No caution navigating the faulted ground."" That's not pop, dude. That's poor. The O. Henry affectations and Magnetic Fields synths of ""Sell Your Hair"" are clever and all, but every time you awkwardly rephrase clichés, I die a little. Hey kids, get this: ""There's nothing quite as pretty as the one you can never hold""! And, uh, Joe, dig the mournful harmonica on ""Saddest Quo"", but what's ""a head of tetra cyclic cattle""? Good thing the title track is instrumental, huh? It's nice that Pernice and brethren like pretty melodies and glossy production. It's to their credit that they release their music on their own tiny label-- just like Black Flag! Jeez, Discover a Lovelier you isn't really even a bad album, only unremarkably OK. Form follows function, and art too reliant on form will inevitably be ephemeral.","Words of encouragement from Joe Pernice and co.

"Mugimama, Is This Monkey Music?",Mugison,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c529eb335119a49ed93e/1:1/w_160/84dedeff.jpg,2005-06-12 06:00:51,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5614-mugimama-is-this-monkey-music/,Accidental,"""Songs like this can drive a man insane,"" sings Ornelius Mugison on ""Sad As a Truck"", a deliriously shredded piece of dada-pop that sits dead-center on Mugimama, Is This Monkey Music? And though this line is delivered with typically exaggerated carny theatricality, there's little on the Icelandic one-man band's third album that enables listeners to dismiss the lyric's sentiment entirely. On his exceptional 2003 debut Lonely Mountain, Mugison brought various streams of bedroom folk, junkyard experimentation, and haphazard electronic pop into some form of unruly convergence. Unfortunately, on Mugimama this prospective unification seems frustratingly distant , as Mugison appears determined to keep the toys from his assorted sandboxes carefully separated, resulting in an occasionally brilliant yet disjointed stylistic grab-bag. A bona-fide pop star in Iceland, Mugi (as he is evidently known back home) recently beat out Björk for Best Pop Album and Best Song at the Icelandic national music awards. And on Mugimama's strongest tracks, these accolades are easily understood. ""Murr Murr"", the song that took home top honors, is a propulsive blur of folkish pop driven by nimble acoustic guitar and Mugi's impassioned vocals, while opener ""I Want You"" sounds like Beck at his most starkly emotive, its strangely pleading lyrics (""Let's go dancing like we talked about/ I'll be the weird boy and you can shout"") delivered with semi-crazed intensity over a lurching glitchy backdrop of plinked guitars and nosediving bass. Another two of the album's highlights-- ""2 Birds"" and ""I'd Ask""-- will sound instantly familiar to any attentive Mugison fans, since variants of each also appeared on his 2004 release Niceland. On these tracks, with his girlfriend Rúna pitching in on additional vocals, Mugi performs with an almost alt-country earthiness, his voice carrying a rather uncanny likeness to Will Oldham circa Arise, Therefore. This rusticity is further amplified on the piano-based ""What I Would Say In Your Funeral"", on which he and Rúna wittily exchange elegies like ""I would tell 'em how I never liked you at allÉthe way you made me sleep on the wet spot."" Mugimama runs itself into trouble, however, in its abrupt segues from these placidly homespun tracks to the jarringly sharp edges of hyperactive pieces like the aforementioned ""Sad as a Truck"" or the woozy electronic burble of ""The Chicken Song"", whose lyrics again feature Mugi and Rúna trading oddball non-sequiters in wild near-whispers (""I want to be intellectual...I'm not a vegetarian/ But I like sitting in the grass/ I don't like them thongs/ But I love tits and ass"") before Mugi makes with a couple Princely howls. Though not without their entertainment value, these songs (as well others like the silly mouth-farting exercise ""Swing Ding"") sound like stowaways from different albums, bearing as much resemblance to their counterparts here as giraffes do to pack mules. And as the album comes to a close with the goofy harmonica breakdown ""Afi Minn"", one has to wonder, as sporadically delightful as Mugimama can be, what new ground Mugison has actually here gained.","On the Icelandic one-man band's third album, Mugi frustratingly doesn't match the peaks of his debut.

Eight years later, in The Wu-Tang Manual, RZA marks '97 as a turning point, when he began ""converting Wu from the dictatorship it had been to a democracy."" Maybe Ezra Pound was onto something when he famously argued that fascism was beneficial art: The democratic incarnation of Wu-Tang has birthed stellar efforts from Ghostface and RZA, but has also turned out some forgettable solo joints and spotty group albums. Method Man seems to be spending more time on screen than on wax. Cappadonna's driving a taxi in Baltimore. Dirty passed on. ""After the laughter..."" Mathematics has been a quiet Clan associate since day one-- he designed their famous logo (an early draft had a hand clutching a hilariously gory severed head sticking out of the now-iconic W), and contributed RZA-sanctioned beats for albums like Ghost's Supreme Clientele and Meth's Tical 2000: Judgment Day. On his second LP, Mathematics succeeds where other recent Wu efforts have faltered by keeping it hot and simple. Instead of trying to push things forward, Math sticks to the basics, and The Problem plays like a subtly modernized précis of vintage '90s Wu-Tang styles. Should've been called The Solution: Take mid-to-up-tempo, cinematic beats and use them for blazing posse cuts that mingle the entirety of the Clan (including Dirt) with competent Nü-Tangers like Eyeslow, Hot Flames, and Bald Head; repeat as necessary. The Problem opens with a reminisce, natch: ""C What I C"", where Mathematics's skittering drums and snake-charming melody pave the way for Eyeslow and T-Slugz to reprise the street-reportage/pining for simpler times themes of ""Can It Be All So Simple""-- see also the beautifully expressive horns of the elegiac ""Tommy"". ""Strawberries and Cream"" is a honeyed, profane slow-jam with a watery soul melody (remember ""Love Jones""?) and swaggering romantic raps from RZA and Ghost (one hopes his line about ""high school pussy"" is a reminisce as well). Where was U-God on that one? You've got your party jams: ""John 3:16"", where Meth monkeys around on a springy cartoon beat, sing-songing hooks and punchlines (""got Milton Bradley hating the game"") like Nelly with a personality; ""Rush"", which pits Meth's rubber chickens against GZA's precisely clipped fingernail rhymes; the bounce-funk club banger ""Two Shots of Henny"". Then there are the thrillingly grim tracks: ""Winta Sno"" gets stupid frosty with silvery minor chords and nihilistic crime rhymes; Ghost and Rae slang-bang ""Real Nillaz"" over frantic drums and skeletal metallic accents; on ""U.S.A."" the bombastic spook-house synths are well-contrasted by Masta Killa's stark straight-talk. There's something sly about imbuing all new songs with a ""best-of"" aura, and it makes for a strong Wu release.","Solid outing from the guy who designed the iconic Wu logo.

Palaa Aurinkoon,Islaja,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a69d034d5c69bf528a/1:1/w_160/f14e77fa.gif,2005-06-12 06:00:49,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4162-palaa-aurinkoon/,Fonal,"Finland's Islaja plays music for staring, so long as you don't expect your visions to coalesce into anything recognizable or ""pretty"" in the traditional sense. Her acoustic-based music soundtracks a hangover, or the scary part of a mushroom binge-- which is different than saying it sounds good when you're hung over or strung out. Rather, her kind of folk music is closer to real life than I want to be in the darkest moments, only intermittently letting the light peek through. Through blurry layers of harmonium, multi-tracked (though not always harmonized) vocals, piano, acoustic guitar, wooden blocks of percussion and bells, she's got more in common with an abstract expressionist painter than a folk musician, using her palette to fill in the details of subconscious experience. Somehow, this doesn't end up sounding overwrought or pretentious. It's a ""naive"" sound, even when I wonder how hard it is to be naive when you're tracking six instruments and polyphonic vocals on every song. Nevertheless, she's kindred to Charalambides, Syd Barrett, and many of her Fonal label mates in this regard: strangely accomplished, but alien and evocative of nothing in particular. Her debut (last year's Meritie) showed promise, but I found it lacking in melody-- which is to say, in exchange for abstraction I usually crave a firm base in reality, obscured or otherwise. Islaja's music is tough to analyze because it's admirably insular. Where, say, Animal Collective draw upon Brazilian music or psychedelic folk, Islaja is only really ""folk"" by association. Her instrumentation and preferred acoustic ambience remind me of someone's traditional music, even if I don't know whose it would be. She continues along these lines on Palaa Aurinkoon (roughly translated to ""burn sun"" and recorded in Glasgow, Scotland of all places), though does sometimes add a bit more rhythmic pulse to her pieces. ""Rukki"" is an interesting song using Islaja's voice-- a distant, repeated two-note figure, and ""ai-oh, ah"" whispers-- as the base over which buzzing synth (?) noise and minor-chord strummed guitar flesh out atmospheres like a visual artist might use flickering, subtly morphing figures around the edge of a central, fuzzy image. Some listeners might want to know what the song is about, but given its elements, I think artist Frank Stella's creed of ""what you see is what you see"" applies. I could peer into these songs for days, but might very well come to the conclusion that it's my own psyche under the microscope rather than Islaja's music. Songs like ""Laivat Saapuu"" and the title track offer what seem like more accessible inroads to the heart of her music, but mislead. The former begins with the toll of toy bells and the singer's high-pitched melody, reminiscent of none other than Devendra Banhart's first record of four-track songs. However, when the saxophones (!) enter with a plaintive drone, the song loses its forward momentum, settling like scum on a swampy lagoon. Her vocals form ""la-la"" patterns that fall under the mini-clang, and before I realize what's happened, the whole song seems to have turned itself upside down. Things really don't settle until the closer ""Rukous"", which uses harmonium and recorders that sound like small train whistles to set up a simple, male-female vocal duet. Regardless of the references I made earlier, Islaja doesn't really sound like anyone else. That works to her advantage for the most part, but if you want a more conventionally attractive ride, Palaa Aurinkoon may leave you feeling malnourished. Still, emotionally interesting musicians who don't immediately make me think of someone else are rare enough that I'm willing to follow along just on principle. In the best cases, abstraction illuminates something vital.","Admirably insular sophomore LP from the Finnish folkie.

"The Complete Peel Sessions, 1978-2004",The Fall,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3f13d197565213b4d6/1:1/w_160/a43b7f3f.jpg,2005-06-12 06:00:48,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2978-the-complete-peel-sessions-1978-2004/,Sanctuary,"The most poignant aspect of this six-disc set is that it is now a document of the past, a finite thing that can no longer be built upon. When the Fall and their labels began work on the compilation, this was not the case-- at that time, it was a document of a living, ongoing relationship between one of Britain's greatest bands and its most legendary DJ, John Peel. But Peel passed away last year, ending a seemingly effortless decades-long run as one of the coolest people on earth, and this six-disc document of his favorite band's appearances on his show instead serves as a sort of encomium. It's at once a tribute to the brilliance of Mark E. Smith and his ""always different, always the same"" band, and to the dedication of a man who never stopped being a fan and never stopped loving new and challenging music. The Fall recorded 24 four-song sessions for Peel over the course of 26 years, capturing nearly every one of the band's many configurations in all their sloppy precision, and this sprawling, amazing release makes the case that every one of them had at least something interesting to offer, including the less-appreciated Fall line-ups of the mid-to-late-90s. The case could even be made that this is the definitive look at the Fall's career to date-- even more than last year's very well-considered 50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong compilation. Of course, at six discs and more than seven hours, it's not the place to start, but anyone with more than four or five Fall albums would be doing themselves a huge service picking this up. To touch on all of the highlights, I'd have to devote a full paragraph to each individual session included on the set, so let's just say that this thing is absolutely loaded, with performances that frequently eclipse the studio versions. The 1980 version of ""New Face In Hell"" is thunderous and Smith's cracking, hysterical vocal is hilariously psychotic-- the band's oft-hidden sense of humor easy to spot. Smith actually laughs on ""Beatle Bones 'n' Smokin' Stones"", and the band's December 1994 piss-take on ""Jingle Bell Rock"" is a case study in sarcastic destruction. Elsewhere, you get two 1983 sessions from the band's mighty double-drummer lineup and a generous offering from the unstoppable mid-80s lineup that produced This Nation's Saving Grace and the Wonderful & Frightening World of the Fall. The TNSG songs hit like a hammer to the head, with a borderline out-of-control take on ""Spilt Victorian Child"" (my favorite Fall song) and a crunching, hypnotic reinvention of ""L.A."" leading the way. As one might expect, the first three discs, which reach up through 1987, are the strongest and most consistent, with the last three discs veering through ever more rapid line-up shifts and wider stylistic ground. What's shocking is the way those last three discs paint a picture of the band's late career as nearly as vital as what preceded it. Fiddler Kenny Brady brings a stronger melodic underpinning to the 1989 and 1991 recordings, without compromising the band's signature rough groove, while some of the band's more electronic 90s material comes off much rawer and crunchier in the live setting. ""Immortality"" in particular becomes fire-breathing, heavy death funk of a caliber the Fall only sporadically achieved in the studio during that phase of their career. The Complete Peel Sessions, 1978-2004 is one of the most straightforward titles a Fall compilation has ever had, and the execution of the package is similarly no-nonsense: The recordings are sequenced in strict chronological order and the remastering is uniformly crisp and sharp, something that's not always the case with retrospectives of this band. It's an embarrassment of riches for the Fall's devoted cult of fans, none of whom should pass this up, and it works surprisingly well for more casual fans who've only just begun to delve into the band's bewildering back catalog.","Expansive (and sadly complete) six-disc set collects 24 four-song Peel Sessions, featuring nearly every incarnation of Mark E. Smith's legendary band.

Disenchanted Hearts Unite,Tullycraft,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a1c0084474cd0c0e83/1:1/w_160/c17e5fa1.jpg,2005-06-09 06:00:57,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8294-disenchanted-hearts-unite/,Magic Marker,"As a frequent proponent of wimpy guitar-pop, I've suspected that ""twee"" (by definition ""overly precious"") was, like ""emo,"" a term critics used, not self-respecting performers-- a too-pat label denoting any band more interested in sunny days, clever hooks, Sarah Records and/or Belle & Sebastian than power chords and faux-rebellious posturing. Tullycraft torpedoed my theory three years ago with ""Twee"", a splickety indie-pop artifact that zoomed in on a whole twee lifestyle with the high-detail focus of a fashion reporter, singer/bassist Sean Tollefson sqeaking, ""Fuck me, I'm twee!"" An even earlier song is titled ""Pop Songs Your New Boyfriend Is Too Stupid to Know About"". Fuck me, meta-twee! Tullycraft bring the meta-twee once more on fourth album Disenchanted Hearts Unite, their second for Portland, Ore. label Magic Marker. Sounding like a cuddlier Weakerthans, Tollefson and co-vocalist Jenny Mears sing about completist punk-rock record collections (catchy opener ""Stowaway""), getting ""indie-famous"" (""Fall 4 U""), tearing the White Stripes off the wall (""Leaders of the New School""), the Murder City Devils (""Polaroids from Mars""), and ""the b-band queen of the music scene"" who ""sold 100 records to all her friends"" (""Girl About Town""). ""Despite my best attempts, I couldn't make you love me with a song,"" Tollefson sings on keyboard-dorked ""Every Little Thing"" after name-checking messageboards and comparing his heartbeat to phone-transmitted techno. Such insular scene-gazing may put off some, but will ring true with a tiny, happy subculture. However, Disenchanted sees Tullycraft expanding its tweer-than-tweeness to encompass more adult topics. One of the stronger songs, ""Our Days in Kansas"", jumps with slow-dance arpeggios and punky rave-ups from a ""disco bloodbath for the ages"" (""oh-oh, oh-oh!"") to ""sometimes I wish we'd kept the baby."" Earlier: ""I never learned the K.U. fight song,"" a perfect detail to express the short duration of a failed romance. On anthemic ""Polaroid From Mars"", Tollefson laments, ""We woke up next to different people/ And the difference found us here."" But the best songs are still tracks like closer ""Secretly Minnesota"", which plays with the amusing notion of a formerly Midwestern recordstore employee who passes for a native Santa Monican-- ""no one wised to the 4-H clover key chain/ Or just how much she loved the rain""-- while casually quipping, ""Ricky says that my band's just a Sebadoh rip-off."" The hook is the album's most infectious, and stands up with any of the band's peers'. While the choruses to ""Leaders of the New School"" and ""Polaroids of Mars"" (and, while I'm being crusty, sort of ""Rumble With the Gang Debs"") are a little too similar, Disenchanted is a solid, self-conscious indie-pop record for solid (i.e. presumably not liquid) self-conscious indie-pop fans. Another of the best songs, ""Molly's Got a Crush on Us"" (""we almost always play for crowds of 12""), was recorded live at a party. ""We're the best band you never heard,"" Tollefson proclaims, a goofy chorus of friends echoing that Rolling Stone et al. hypeline for bands with two or fewer Pitchfork reviews. Maybe. But crowds of 12 across the country are likely to think so, and that's probably meta-OK.","More meta-twee from co-vocalists Sean Tollefson and Jenny Mears.

Team Sleep,Team Sleep,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a0c0084474cd0c0e80/1:1/w_160/d2e2eefb.jpg,2005-06-09 06:00:56,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8293-team-sleep/,Maverick,"Team Sleep features Deftones vocalist Chino Moreno and his longtime friend, guitarist Tom Wilkinson. Along with DJ Crook, the product brings the moodiness of Deftones' later work (their song ""Teenager"" has been a widely-used but apt comparison point) with little of its hardness, and builds it all from drum loops. However, that was back in 2001, until someone leaked the album to the Internet, causing the band to quickly shelve it. Since then, the songs have changed considerably and the stable of guest musicians has grown to include Mike Patton, Melissa Auf Der Mar, Zach Hill (Hella), Mary Timony (Helium), and Rob Crow (of Pinback, Heavy Vegetable, Thingy, and probably three other projects started during the nap I took before finishing this review. The man loves to work). First song ""Ataraxia"" builds from electronic drums and growling bass, with some bright guitar picking and a bit of piano, before hitting the wall-of-guitar melodrama that Deftones have used in songs like ""Be Quiet and Drive"" or ""Minerva"". ""Your Skull Is Red"" features pulverizing drumming from Zach Hill, but i'ts indiscriminate guitar sludge with a lot of atmosphere but no hook. That and ""Live From the Stage"" are no more than jam sessions, and the finely-tuned gloss of tracks like ""Ataraxia"" shows those songs up. Even ""Blvd. Knights"", with its ill-fit tempo-changing climax and verse parts audible under the heavy guitars in the chorus, point towards hasty execution. ""Ever (Foreign Flag)"", however, steps further into ambience while keeping the melodrama and electronic beats. It builds upon the gentler influences beneath Deftones' material (early Cure and Depeche Mode, who they've both covered) but it's far enough removed from Deftones to really justify this project. ""Ever Since WWI"" is another success, a slow strum that's cathartic without ever dialing up the distortion, likely because of Zach Hill's peerless bass drum action. Calling Rob Crow a ""guest"" is misleading; he takes lead vocal duties for four songs, and most of those sound markedly like Pinback. He croons over ""Princeton Review"", a gentle guitar strum with a skittering loop that shifts tone with an ominous percussive breakdown. Mary Timony is featured on the dour ""Tomb of Liegia"", an atonal dirge that's the low point of the record. Unfortunately, while none of the guests are phoning it in (the visible ones, anyway), they never learn much from each other. Even though he's sharing time with Moreno on ""Our Ride to the Rectory"", Crow's parts could just as easily be cut'n'pasted from one of his own songs. ""Elizabeth"" is similarly stuck in Pinback mode, though it's spiced up by an unbelievably brief moment of blistering electronic drums. I never thought I'd be calling Team Sleep ""conservative,"" but holding back the harsher elements in this track to seven whole seconds almost proves my point: The artists here could have taken more chances, because this album hints at a fascinating and rewarding listen. I say ""hints"" because those moments are few on a record that just drifts by the listener's ears. It's short on hooks, but it isn't necessarily aimless just restrained. It's no surprise that one of the bands' songs was used on the Matrix Revolution; these songs are appropriate soundtracks to hyper-real, stylized encounters. Even the lyrics to the beat-driven misstep ""King Diamond"" view a male/female encounter in video game terms, with it's ""start...restart"" shouting and subtle variations. It's the kind of music for which Windows Media Player visualizations were made. If this had been released in 2001, it could have followed the market of electronic-dabbling modern rock compiled on the original Matrix soundtrack, and ran towards success. Today, it's background noise, make-out music for teenagers with lip piercings and caked eyeliner. I respect their effort to blend genre, and while Team Sleep is executed with taste, it's without the risks that should accompany any project calling itself ""experimental.""","Long-fermenting LP from Deftones vocalist Chino Moreno features guests Mike Patton, Melissa Auf Der Mar, Zach Hill (Hella), Mary Timony (Helium), and Rob Crow (Pinback).

Godfather of Hip-Hop,Spoonie Gee,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a9b1335d7bf1698ea0/1:1/w_160/e90c9efa.gif,2005-06-09 06:00:55,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7811-godfather-of-hip-hop/,Tuff City,"Robert Christgau said it best-- Spoonie Gee's groove is so old it's new, and Spoonie Gee's groove is plenty old-- the self-appointed Godfather cut his first track in 1979, and got his big break as a result of being the godson of the founders of both Enjoy Records and Sugarhill Records. Take a listen to that first track, ""Spoonin' Rap"", cut back when Gabriel Jackson was all of 16. His bravado and charm instantly place him in a continuum where you can believe Spoonie was an original member of the Treacherous Three. On the other hand, Spoonie's conversational savoir faire looks forward to a time where rappers skimmed over the beat and didn't make like an end-rhyming red bouncing ball. And he was doing it for a good five or six minutes at a time, as all MCs did back in the day, when rap still dangled from disco's umbilical cord. ""Love Rap"" bears some of that baby fat. Spoonie himself rightfully claims this track is one of the first attemps to pitch woo yes-yes-y'all style. Unlike future luva-luvas like Cool James, Spoonie respectfully bumrushes ladies with his rapid-fire flow-- ""I got a cure for all women, and hope you understand/ Why they call me Spoonie Gee, the medicine man/ Because I do it with greed and not too much speed/ So just take off your clothes, lemme give you what you need"". Spoonie proves he can run at different speeds, though-- ""The Big Beat"" is more prescient of the cool and confident 60-minute-man approach LL and his type of guys perfected. This retrospective veers from enjoyable in its own right to stodgy historical document with a couple of duff tracks in the middle (the smudged white lining of ""Street Girl"", and the stiff chirpy ""Get Off My Tip""), but then rights the ship quickly. ""Yum Yum"" finds a swaggering Spoonie slapping ""toast"" in front of his ""master of ceremonies"" appelation, and is followed by ""Take It Off"" doin' da butt DC go-go style. Tracks like ""The Godfather"" (produced by hip-hop pioneer Marley Marl) and ""Hit Man"" (produced by future New Jack Swing king Teddy Riley) are decent enough tracks from an older and wiser version of Spoonie Spoon, but, as this disc presents it, Spoonie was at his best spitting non-stop rhymes over skeletal beats, filling the gaps in the tracks with his unending charisma. The final track of this compilation, ""You's an Old Fool"", hearkens back to those days, looping the now-well-worn sample of the Honeydrippers' ""Impeach the President"" so Spoonie can hold court on the sorts of fellas that date (and get played by) the girls who still might be a twinkle in their daddies' eyes. It's a sign of those times (back in 1987) that Spoonie doesn't overwhelm the track-- here, the music is the hook, not the MC. As such, it comes off as a track featuring Spoonie Gee rather than a Spoonie Gee track. But just like a saavy athlete saving his best for crunch time, Spoonie knows when to pick his spots-- ""Cause you're much too old, he's much younger/ To her you're like drizzling rain, but he's thunder."" If the only thing you know about Spoonie Gee is Mike D.'s shout-out in ""So Whatcha Want?"", here's the perfect opportunity to get familiar.","Spoonie's conversational savoir faire colors ""Spoonin' Rap"", ""Love Rap"", and other classics.

If You Don't Already Have a Look,The Dirtbombs,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5dabf31b7dc7155a8f/1:1/w_160/45b977cf.jpg,2005-06-09 06:00:54,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2532-if-you-dont-already-have-a-look/,In the Red,"Like all great garage-rock bands, the Dirtbombs have always maintained a reverence for the glories of the 7"" single. Throughout their decade-plus career the Dirtbombs have used the format precisely as nature intended: Stocking their wide and sundry A-sides with all their choicest cuts while using their B-sides to stash away half-baked experiments, weird cover versions and a dazzling assortment of non-album strays. Since the Dirtbombs have released their impressive multitudes of 7"" EPs, split-singles, and compilation tracks on an unruly array of tiny labels across the globe, hunting all of them down would previously have required ample cash, shrewd timing, and fancy footwork. Thankfully, however, that changes with the release of If You Don't Already Have a Look-- a mammoth two-disc, 52-song collection that assembles all of the band's hardest-to-find rarities along with a generous selection of previously unreleased material, and eight brand new tracks. Featuring one disc of originals and one of covers, as well as a lavish booklet of photos and liner notes, the set provides the group's established fans with an outrageous embarrassment of riches, while giving latecomers a stupefying crash course in the Dirtbombs' lo-tech, casually explosive soul-punk. Anchored by the multi-talented Mick Collins-- formerly of primitive rock demi-legends the Gories and Blacktop-- this set's most immediately striking characteristic is its sheer consistency of quality, as there are scarcely any absolute throwaway performances lurking among these 52 tracks. (Which is astounding when you consider some of them were originally destined to become flipsides in New Zealand.) Granted, things get awfully raw on abrasive bash-ups like ""I'm Saving Myself For Nichelle Nichols"" or the self-explanatory ""They Hate Us In Scandinavia"", but these brief (often 1 minute or less) dissonant interludes here merely serve as palate-cleansers between such irresistible originals as ""The Sharpest Claws"" or the mirror-ball swagger of ""Here Comes That Sound Again."" On these tracks Collins repeatedly proves his astonishing versatility as a vocalist-- his nonchalantly soulful pipes draw easy comparison to early Arthur Lee-- and his underrated prowess as a guitarist, particularly since he operates in a genre that puts little premium on technical ability. As satisfying as the Dirtbombs' originals are, however, the real fun on If You Don't Already Have a Look begins when you move to the all-covers disc two. Though this set features a couple predictable choices (the Stones, Stevie Wonder, In the Red labelmates Cheater Slicks) there's also a fantastic abundance of oddball selections from such acts as Yoko Ono, Lou Rawls, ESG, and Soft Cell. On each of these covers-- whether it's on their dubbed-out remake of ""Mystified"" by the Romantics (!) or their genuinely heartfelt delivery of the Bee Gees' ""I Started a Joke"", the Dirtbombs display their uncanny talent for distilling a song down to its most primal, molten essence-- exposing unsuspected depths of bare emotion that are now fully amplified as the listener finally gets a chance to hear all of these marvels back-to-back.","Two-disc, 52-track LP collects the garage rock band's singles, rarities, and unreleased material, plus adds eight new tracks.

Endtroducing... [Deluxe Edition],DJ Shadow,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9cb9d034d5c69bf52df/1:1/w_160/781b7abb.jpg,2005-06-09 06:00:53,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2377-endtroducing-deluxe-edition/,Mo'WaxMo'Wax,"Ask the NoCal turntable nerds, the trip-hoppers, the frat boys, the hippies or the ravers stoned on the beach at sunrise: Endtroducing... is deeply spiritual. Not in the conventional sense, but in the spirituality of the soul that lives in your chest and got there from the ether and returns to the collective unconscious-- the one you feel when you feel things. That's the spirit that saves us from being fleeting and disposable: If I necked with that one girl that one sunset, with Endtroducing on the car stereo, then no matter who else did the same thing, I'm me and that moment's still mine. Dig? Endtroducing taps that inner-whatever better than most of the albums of its day, and it swims so easily that it established an entire genre of instrumental hip-hop-- count how many records come out every month and are dubbed ""Shadowesque."" Building the album from samples of lost funk classics and bad horror soundtracks, Shadow crossed the real with the ethereal, laying heavy, sure-handed beats under drifting, staticky textures, friendly ghost voices, and chords whose sustain evokes the vast hereafter. Even the ""look at me"" cuts like ""The Number Song"" didn't break the mood; the album was so perfect and the technique, so awesome that it's still definitive today, and Shadow has yet to top it. (Never mind that if Four Tet could swing a record as proficient as The Private Press, we would throw him a parade.) For this Deluxe Edition, Endtroducing hasn't been enhanced or remastered, but it now comes with a bonus disc of remixes and singles, including Cut Chemist's fantastic ""party mix"" of ""The Number Song"" and Gift of Gab's rhymes on ""Midnight in a Perfect World"", as well as alternate versions that give a useful perspective on the album. For example, ""Building Steam With a Grain of Salt"" and ""Mutual Slump"" omit the overdubbed speech, and without it, the samples seem naked and duller-- which highlights one of the album's subtler strengths. But Shadow can't avoid the irony that this is a revival of an album that revives other albums. We could be hearing this music, not for the second time around, but for the third and maybe the fourth. The buzz of these dug-up sounds infuses the texture of the album; focusing on it reminds me of the few times that I've heard an album by a deceased performer and actually realized he had passed-- like the time I listened to Kind of Blue the night that Miles Davis joined three of its personnel in the grave, and felt their absence, even while their solos hadn't lost a shred of vitality. Shadow clearly gets that. In the documentary Scratch, Shadow takes us to the record store where he found most of the vinyl used on Endtroducing. Upstairs we see the regular shelves and bins, but downstairs, in the basement, are tens of thousands of old albums stacked or dumped all over the room, barely lit by a few light bulbs and littered with dust and dead bats. Shadow patronized the store for five years before they let him in this crypt, and as he says in the documentary, ""Just being in here is a humbling experience for me, because you're looking through all these records and it's sort of like a big pile of broken dreams...Whether you want to admit it or not, 10 years down the line you'll be in here. So keep that in mind when you start thinking like, 'I'm invincible and I'm the world's best,' or whatever. Because that's what all these cats thought."" We usually dismiss reissues of CDs as the ultimate cash-in-- the most cynical way for artists like Elvis Costello to charge us again and again for the same album. We think this because we assume that once you commit music to a disc and put it in a store, it's immortal. But without new attention and rereleases, albums can drift off the radar. Today, Entroducing may be a legend of the 1990s, but the world of beat-driven music regularly throws away old milestones to make room for new ones. How do we know this album will impress-- let alone connect with-- anyone 10 or 20 years down the road? So you could call this rerelease Shadow's first bid for a legacy, and his admission that no matter how many fans called Endtroducing a masterpiece, someone else needs to slap that word on the cover for the next batch of kids. Yet even more than the first time, this is also a meditation on mortality. Shadow knows what it's like to wander through that basement, find some buried treasure-- some sax riff like those immortal notes on ""What Does Your Soul Look Like, (Pt. 1 - Blue Sky Revisit)""-- and resurrect it for millions of listeners, like an irrational God on beats 'n breaks Judgment Day. And he also knows how it feels to be in that bin, like all of us on the way to our own graves, where we'll be trapped with all the other goners-- hoping someone will see something a little different and special in us, that might pull us out of the pile.","Reissue of the pioneering instrumental hip-hop album adds a bonus disc of remixes and singles.

Know Doubt EP,Cex,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57eea9e61561daa5154/1:1/w_160/ff30022e.gif,2005-06-08 06:01:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1393-know-doubt-ep/,Jade Tree,"I don't think Rjyan Kidwell (aka Cex) is weird per se, just caught at an awkward moment, on every record. Think of that video circulating around the Internet with the painfully awkward prepubescent kid reenacting Star Wars lightsaber duels. Kidwell's first albums, and concerts, were chock-full of teenage panache, braggadocio, and shock value-- a combination that culminated on 2001's vitriolic yet playful Oops, I Did It Again! Then bam, our cocksure Stars Wars kid gets a sudden bout of self-awareness as Kidwell tears out his playful IDM bells and whistles on 2003's misanthropic Maryland Mansions, replacing them with unapologetic electro scrapes, fractured beats and bitter cowls. For such a conscientious and oftentimes self-deprecating album, it established Kidwell as a ""grown-up"" artist, and made haters feel pretty rotten for snickering at our Star War kid's previous works. No wonder Kidwell has little left to say on Know Doubt, a recording about as polemic and intricate as a fart in church. Maybe melody isn't supposed to be the focus of this record, but apparently neither is rhythm, as Know Doubt kicks off with a potpourri of bleak, uninteresting sound effects on ""Every Extreme"" and closes similarly with ""S Opposite"", an unfledged take on M83. Also surprising, in that predictably unpredictable Cex way, is Kidwell's vocal dissociation from his songs, a stark contrast to narcissistic Maryland Mansion numbers like ""Kill Me"" and ""My Head"". Whether through distortion effects or equivocal lyrics, ambiguity surrounds Kidwell's voice. Even on ""Contains It""-- the EP's catchiest and most direct track-- overdubbed vocals and busy instrumentation dissemble Kidwell's desperate ""help me"" plea. ""State Secretly"" and ""Every Song Ever"" utilize the vocals as instruments, with the former centered around looping, paranoid phrases (""They're gonna find out!/ You're gonna have to leave!"") while the latter dices the lyrics into spasmodic segments unintelligibly bled into one another. This relatively boring offering is salvaged, however, by Kidwell's proficiency behind the boards. While Cex the producer may hardly be as enticing as Cex the performer, Know Doubt would implode on self-importance and paucity if not for the occasional redemptive beat or synth swell. For a record consisting of so many discordant components, it's slapped together rather nicely. Maybe our freewheelin' Cex has worn out his outlandish, dicks-out shtick, but no amount of self-immolating records can erase the fact that Kidwell twists and turns knobs with the best of 'em. Hopefully what we're seeing here is a drawn-out but worthwhile reinvention of the Cex persona, and not a feckless search for a fabled, deeper Cex that's not there.","Unusually for Cex, the sonics are the highlights here.

On a great beat, the duo of Chris and Neef will sound great. On a terrible beat, they'll sound terrible. Both members have essentially the same flow: A prim, conversational mumble that usually turns sing-songy on the hooks. (Chris sounds slightly more gruff; Neef is slightly more nimble.) Their voices don't carry a hint of emotion or personality. They sound exactly the same rapping about guns as they do about girls, and neither one ever says anything remotely quotable. And so Brothers From Another doesn't really belong to either Chris or Neef. The album belongs instead to producer Chad ""Wes"" Hamilton, who turns in seven of the album's 12 tracks. Hamilton knows his way around a drum machine, and his tracks for Brothers From Another have a slick, chilly electro pulse, like the skeletal booming drum machines of mid-80s Marley Marl with the rough edges polished off and replaced them with a glossy futuristic sheen. ""Don't Stop (YG Party)"" supports a rippling marimba loop with eerie, rolling bass tones. ""It's the Life"" has a spare, empty shuffle and a ghostly, sustained synth wash. On the thug love ballad ""Don't Keep Me Waiting"" guests 112 coo like a prepubescent New Edition while Duran Duran cheese guitars and a popping slap bass swoop trough the track. The tracks that Hamilton didn't produce have the same lustrous throb. On his two tracks, for instance, Swizz Beats forgoes hype-man yelling and Jay-Z vocal samples for amazing swirling pianos on ""Beef"" and canned electro synths on lead single ""Set It Off"". The one glaring exception is the unbelievably obnoxious Kanye West pianos-and-string ballad ""Grown Man Pt. 2"", featuring one of Kanye's unbearable loverman verses and a hook with John Legend doing his best to impersonate the world's most generic lounge singer. On Young Gunz' 2004 debut Tough Luv, the duo was constantly overshadowed by infinitely more talented guests like Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel. The few guest rappers on Brothers From Another (Daz, Memphis Bleek, Pooda Brown) fit the Gunners' personality vacuum. But with Hamiton's glittering, clanking tracks, personality is beside the point.

Twice Around the Earth,Chris Cutler,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73bc0084474cd0c0b40/1:1/w_160/e14914da.jpg,2005-06-08 06:00:59,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1809-twice-around-the-earth/,ReR,"Record what you're doing right now. Don't worry about the fidelity, just hit ""record"" on your walkman or minicassette player, attach it to your pocket and we'll take care of the rest. Yes, I'm interested in what you get on tape. I really do want to hear how your refrigerator door sounds, and what's playing on television through the wall. The traffic outside is of particular interest, as is the conversation of whoever might be sitting nearby, or across the hall, or downstairs. When you have about thirty minutes, stop the tape, and send it to me. Don't worry, I'll take the best snippet, and immortalize your mundane vignette. In fact, ask a couple of your friends to do the same thing, and I'll make all of you stars. Avant-stars! If this sounds like a waste of time, maybe you need some convincing. British experimental musician Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears, Pere Ubu, head of ReR Records) has assembled some of the most interesting aural moments in the lives of other like-minded musicians. He did this for Out of the Blue Radio, a broadcast project funded by the London Musicians Coop from July 2002 to July 2003, using snippets of sound taken from all over the world. The only catch was, his contributors had to record their sound during the time the broadcast would air-- 11:30 pm to midnight, in whatever time zone the person lived. Cutler took the 30-minute records and aired them for the program, unaltered. Think of it as reality entertainment of a sort. For Twice Around the Earth, Cutler went a step further, editing 43 of the recordings he received into short snippets, and arranged them chronologically into the lengthy title track. Additionally, the piece follows the contributors geographically, acting as a sound guide, literally twice around the world. On this CD, Cutler also includes his recording ""Lux"", taken from in the inside of a cafeteria, and ""Blue Winter"": Thirty-four more contributor recordings selected and arranged by Cutler and kindred spirit/engineer Bob Drake. Since both ""Twice Around the Earth"" and ""Blue Winter"" feature dozens of short, physically disconnected segments of sound, you might expect a dizzying, disorienting experience. Far from it: the segments tend to dissolve into one another, and the overall effect is one of constantly shifting, but ever blending still life. The opening of the title track, the Blue Radio theme, replete with clock tower chimes, segues seamlessly into English composer John Scott's jogging along the Thames, which in turn transforms into David Lee Myers' Frog Lake, New York soundscape of, yes, frogs and crickets, moving right along to experimental sound design artist Thomas Dimuzio in San Francisco recording the noise outside his window, only to erupt in Hardy Fox's recording of piano at the Musee Mechanique, also in San Francisco. This is the pace of ""Twice Around the World"": technically breathless, but in practice, more like an ambient night train. The quieter moments (like Otomo Yoshihide's short Tokyo apartment recording, or the Hafler Trio's Andrew Mackenzie recording the Reykjavik air across the street from Björk's place) never seem far removed from the more boisterous ones (Jon Rose's overheard nightlife conversation in Australia, or the bizarre electronic noise of Haco and Christopher in Kobe, Japan), even when I know they're different in almost every way. Cutler's ""Lux"" unfolds more naturally, with uninterrupted activity from a Luxembourg cafeteria. Yes, you get the quiet roar of people talking, the clang of dishes, the squeak of rubber souls on marble, a lone, repeated piano motif in the distance, unintelligible loudspeaker announcements-- practically a greatest hits of urban interior ambience. Background noise it may be, but as with any number of sparse, free improv records, its effectiveness is rooted in an unpredictability even when I ""know"" exactly what is happening. Of course, there will be people who deny this is music at all, but I'm not sure that's the point. Cutler's document suggests that when the sounds around us are so intrinsically interesting, there's no need to frame them with structure or artifice.","Engaging experimental music from the former Art Bears and Henry Cow member.

A River Ain't Too Much to Love,Smog,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4835e6ef959693208ba/1:1/w_160/360ab682.jpg,2005-06-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7286-a-river-aint-too-much-to-love/,Drag City,"Bill Callahan, the man behind Smog's dark, conflicted narratives, is often critically thought to be ""enigmatic""-- mainly because he addresses frequently passionate subjects with dispassion. In that sense, the tag becomes more like shorthand to describe a singer-songwriter who doesn't spill his every weepy desire. But I've never really bought into the idea that Callahan is an exotic, unknowable creature, and I've never bought into the idea that his work has to be inscrutable (or let's be more rock critic-y and say ""inaccessible"") to be effective. Even at his least explicit, Callahan's music comes across as an honest assessment of its creator. For that, he's sometimes also labeled a jerk and a misogynist, among other things, but that may be the price of doing business for an artist who refuses to paint himself in the rosy hues of everlasting love or the antique sepia of ""heartfelt"" loss-- in short, refusing to paint over his own complexity. The existential nature of Callahan's music has been touched on before, as he presents himself allegorically in his albums-- a hash of emotions, desires, and needs, frequently uncertain of the world beyond the nose on his face, aware only of himself and his mortality, and, most crucially, drawing his own detached security directly from that awareness. He gets called an enigma because he resembles a human being in a medium where people are used to seeing caricatures. And all that is just a way of excusing the kinder, gentler Smog that has settled in on 2003's Supper and now A River Ain't Too Much to Love, Callahan's 12th proper album. The more confrontational sound of early Smog-- the distinct instrumentation and the sometimes sardonic and sometimes nasty edge-- has been blunted, whether by age or simply a desire to not repeat himself. Instead, Callahan relies almost exclusively on acoustic strumming and easy melodies, forsaking much of the biting cynicism of his more highly regarded work. Although not as compelling as his more subversive material, this softening of his sound doesn't carry the negative connotation of an artist losing steam later in his career; Callahan's distinctive baritone and cutting inflection are unchanging and iconic, and show that this sensitive appearance is just one more spin of the kaleidoscope. As Callahan deadpans on ""I'm New Here"", ""I did not become someone different.../ No matter how far wrong you've gone/ You can always turn around."" For the gentleness of its tone, a listen to ""Say Valley Maker"" makes clear the message here: ""Bury me in wood, and I will splinter/ Bury me in stone, and I will quake/ Bury me in water, and I will geyser/ Bury me in fire, and I'm gonna phoenix"". It's about transcendence after death, or-- for a man so clearly wrapped up in his own mortality in the past-- one of peace after the tumult of confronting that mortality. On previous records, after tossing a broken bottle into the woods-- frustrated because he couldn't work to open ""The Well""-- Callahan-as-Camus might've mused on the inconsequence or futility of the act. Here, he still throws the bottle, but suffers pangs of conscience, feeling sorry ""for the doe-paw, and the rabbit-paw,"" and goes looking for the shards. Callahan's a bit new to this sort of territory, occasionally tripping over some surprisingly hokey imagery, and it may not suit those who crave the immediate emotional impact of his more tormented work. But, like any other Smog album, it would be incomplete if it pandered to a one-dimensional view of its creator. In that sense, A River Ain't Too Much to Love makes perfect sense. An album that might be superficially seen as inappropriately becalmed, in its own subdued way, feels instead like life welling up where it had once been suppressed, as human as anything Callahan has ever done.","On his 12th album, Bill Callahan relies almost exclusively on acoustic strumming and easy melodies, forsaking much of the biting cynicism of his more highly regarded work.

Live From Austin TX,Richard Thompson,by: Stephen M.

On the 15 tracks collected on the souvenir album, Live From Austin TX (as if you need to qualify Austin with a state name), he plays guitar with an efficiency that's almost corporate, deploying melodic filigrees that downsize all but the most crucial notes and draw on a highly personal style enriched by Celtic and folk traditions, American rock and jazz, and even a little reggae. To redirect the business metaphor slightly: On this CD, Thompson could be a guitar salesman demonstrating his product. See how simple it is to sound like three guitars at once. Now you too you can mimic a banjo or a slide guitar in your home or office. In other words, Thompson makes it all-- the gamboling solos; the booming vocals; the often humorous, biting lyrics-- seem so easy. That's both the attraction and the flaw of this live album: its technical proficiency is amazing, but at times a little cold. This isn't really Thompson's fault, but an unavoidable logistical circumstance, as his recorded appearance episode ran well beyond CD capacity. Almost all of his stage banter (which was minimal to begin with) has been excised to squeeze in as many songs as possible. Even then, the nearly eight-minute, show-closing ""Put It There Pal"" had to go too. (The full concert is available on DVD.) Thompson played ""Austin City Limits"" in July 2001, just four months after his Capitol Records best-of, Action Packed, marked the end of his 11-year tenure at the label. So the bulk of the tracklist comes from that era, with particular attention to 1999's underrated Mock Tudor (too bad ""Cibella"", a personal favorite, wasn't included). Backed by an equally professional rhythm section-- Michael Jerome on drums and Danny Thompson on stand-up bass-- Thompson opens with a jubilantly defiant version of ""Cooksferry Queen"", about a suburban businessman in love with an inner-city hippie, then follows it up with a starkly intense ""Uninhabited Man"" and a bouncy ""Walking the Long Miles Home"". But the highlights of the first half of the set predate Mock Tudor: ""All Bowlly's in Heaven"" is a dark jazz lament, and ""Mingus Eyes"" sounds desperate and fittingly duplicitous. Thompson plays an acoustic guitar during that first half of the show, then switches to an electric for the second half, which adds grit to ""Bathsheba Smiles"" and noir moodiness to ""Ghost in the Wind"". He spits venom on the caustic ""She Twists the Knife"", but the reggae rhythms of ""Crawl Back (Under My Stone)"" lead nicely into a call and response with the audience that's easily the most unguarded moment on the album. That is, until Thompson picks up his acoustic again for the closer, ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning"". It's one of his most popular late-career songs, and he's probably played it too many times to count. But he invests it with what sounds like fresh and bottomless heartache, making the story of young lovers and vintage motorcycles seem all the more tragically inevitable. Thompson's a man who obviously loves his work.","Fifteen-track LP captures an ""Austin City Limits"" performance.

Early Man EP,Early Man,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd09abf31b7dc7155e5f/1:1/w_160/d68e9fb6.jpg,2005-06-07 06:01:07,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2927-early-man-ep/,Monitor,"Not for nothing is it called metal. There's some flexibility to the idiom-- it can be light and aerodynamic or titanically heavy; quick and nimble or unapologetically slothful; deadly efficient or clumsily longwinded-- but one thing is sure: There's no opposing force it cannot withstand. If the carnival strongman can bend you over his shoulders, you've failed. For their part, Early Man fail robustly on their new self-titled EP. Rife with blunders both technical and tactical, the album dumbfounds more than it offends. The band aren't inept, but trying to nail Reign in Blood kicks without razor-sharp chops is fatuous. Taking on the metal demigods, Early Man are like a squad of college doughboys come to contend against Schwarzenegger for Mr. Universe '73. The band is manhandled by their own poorly-executed songs. Sloppiness is part and parcel of the stoner metal appellation, but Early Man don't fester in reverb-saturated mud-pits of their imprecision; they chug, stomp, wiggle and kick the way a more technically proficient outfit might, only seldom hitting their target. Word is, Early Man was hastily recorded on free studio time and intended just as a promotional tool for the undiscovered duo. In that case, it's easier to forgive the flaccid recording, which sounds pounded into a squishy pâté. Metal comes served many ways, but spread on crackers is not a preferred method. Delivered in a studied Hetfieldian croon, Mike Conte's vocals are deliberately dumb and devoid of imagination. As a beer-sodden brawler's anthem, ""Fight!"" is successful: it couldn't be more retarded. ""Alright, so you wanna fight,"" Conte sings, ""My fists are sticks of dynamite/ Fuck you if you're talking to may/ My fuse blows quick like T-N-Tay!"" At least give us the Angel of Death, or something remotely visceral. Fortunately, Conte's verses on ""The Undertaker Is Calling You"" are warped beyond recognition-- the sound is much more convincing than the meaning. Early Man are disagreeably contrived, ripping from metal legends past and present with sufficient accuracy but little reverence. (I thought I caught a whiff of parody, although now I'm pretty sure the band are entirely sincere.) ""Death Is the Answer to My Prayers"" is a Sabbath-style dirge, complete with plenty of stupid-fun quarter-note bashing and a demonically crooked vocal delivery. But as with this perfunctory teaser's other two tracks, Early Man can rock so much harder. Here's hoping their new label, Matador, finds these boys a fancy engineer who'll sharpen the blades and give their words someplace to hide. Such a fine-tuning might not flip that rating, but it would give the band's broken-bottle narratives some heft.","Broken-bottle narratives and Slayer-like sonics.

And Everything Else...,Nobody,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b980c0084474cd0c2614/1:1/w_160/d0485537.jpg,2005-06-07 06:01:06,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5914-and-everything-else/,Plug Research,"Based on their many partnerships both on tour and on record, I like to think of Prefuse 73, Four Tet, Caribou, and Nobody as a tightly-knit bunch of like-minded innovators that cherry-pick the past in order to advance the future of brain-bubbling beatmaking. I also like to think they often argue over whose oh-so-mysterious alias is the coolest (""It's, like, before 'fuse,' man. Way before.""). And since all four members of this elite class have recently graduated from indie darlings to veteran indie darlings, the time is ripe to dole out some milestone-marking superlatives. Best Dressed, of course, goes to Prefuse and the tinted Onassis sunglasses that nearly overshadowed the lackluster material from this year's Surrounded By Silence at recent shows. Caribou gets Most Spirited for his tenacious drumming and overall sense of overflowing sonic enthusiasm. By consistently violating the instrumental-dude ""no smiling"" rule on his album covers and press photos, Four Tet takes Friendliest. Which leaves us with Nobody aka Elvin Estela, the shadowy, hairy member of the de facto troupe. With his first album for L.A.-based label Plug Research (Daedelus, Dntel), the Calm, Cool & Collected recipient combines the varying textures of his jazzy debut LP Soulmates and its superior psych-infused follow-up Pacific Drift: Western Water Music Vol. 1, surfacing with a canny mix of West Coast indie-hop beats and hazy, flowing aural hallucinations. The album's seemingly defeatist title matches Estela's similarly downtrodden moniker, but And Everything Else... is anything but a rainy-day collection of odds 'n' sods. Best experienced with the sun beating down, the taught 12 tracks mark the producer's most diverse and song-based work yet. The trippy, shimmering tone is established by opener ""The Coast Is Clear (For Fireworks)"", which rides a smooth-knocking shuffle along the California shoreline as wafts of blurry, delayed guitars, cheery keys and charming firework noises pop and burst in the distance. A tame, organ-heavy cover of the Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin ballad ""What Is the Light?"" featuring members of Beachwood Sparks on vocals follows, but its lethargic pace and surprising lack of experimentation render it a boring and predictable lowlight. Most of the record's collaborations hit their mark though, like the Mia Toi Dodd assisted ""You Can Know Her"", a sparkling lullaby that uses the singer's lofty, sea-nymph delivery to stunning effect. ""Tori Oshi"" is the second collaboration between Estela and Scott Heren under their La Correccion banner and it's a nimble, finger-picking electro-folk jaunt; it serves as a welcome contrast to the plodding ""La Correccion Exchange"" featured on Prefuse's Surrounded by Silence. Even on the record's more hopped-up songs like the wind-up toy bumping ""Wake Up and Smell the Millennium"", Estela is still playing the effortless host to his own infinite California-daze slumber party. Nobody offers grooves that won't interfere with your daily routine as much as enhance it from the outside in, sneakily setting a distinct mood without really trying. Then, before you can even ask him to sign your yearbook, he's disappeared into the hot-pavement fog.","On his Plug Research debut, Nobody combines the textures of his jazzy debut and its superior psych-infused follow-up.

Cuts Across the Land,The Duke Spirit,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb4ea9e61561daa72d7/1:1/w_160/dee6b2e0.jpg,2005-06-07 06:01:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2613-cuts-across-the-land/,Loog,"If they wanted to, the Duke Spirit could probably hook up a few synthesizers, apply some hairspray, and become to Blondie what the Killers are to Duran Duran. But hey, that'd be too easy; instead, Cuts Across the Land is an album brimming with the piss and vinegar expected from a band toiling-- until recently-- fruitlessly in the British music scene since 2002. Of course, that sort of elbow grease is required when you're aiming to usurp the femme-blues throne currently occupied by PJ Harvey and newbies the Kills and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Duke Spirit singer Leila Moss possess the scowl of Karen O, with a haunting, reserved quality that, at its darkest, is reminiscent of Kim Gordon. ""Darling You're Mean"" at first lulls listeners with a pacific guitar pattern and breathy vocals before launching into a menacing, dissonant chorus. ""Oooh no, yeah it's comin' back/ And I say oooh, Jesus Christ, yeah it's drivin' me mad"" wails Moss with enough unnerving frankness to frighten even the most petulant, chauvinist male blues singer. Instrumentally, Cuts Across the Land loses some steam from the band's cataclysmic yet cogent live performance. Still, that doesn't prevent singles ""Love Is an Unfamiliar Name"" and ""Cuts Across the Land"" from staking their claim in 2005's indie honor roll. The former rides an ascending guitar riff until Moss's heartbreak boils over into a flurry of piqued ""Oh-oh-oh's"". The title track taps the Jesus and Mary Chain mentality of repeating a basic chord progression until it sounds revolutionary-- and a clamoring, Sonic Youth-inspired breakdown two-thirds through serves as a dead-on extension of Moss's scoffing persona. Unfortunately, the album's murky mix reveals a few songwriting bugs, particularly on slower-paced tracks. Despite the blemishes, Cuts Across the Land is a surprisingly galvanized and consistent offering from a band that has hardly registered a blip on most British, let alone American, radar screens-- an inverse Coldplay of sorts. Score one for the underdog.","Latest UK buzz band apes the femme-blues of the Kills and Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

Titanic Days,Kirsty MacColl,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c353c0084474cd0c3442/1:1/w_160/54a951de.jpg,2005-06-07 06:01:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5015-titanic-days/,IRSIRS,"There's something incredibly bittersweet about this reissue of Kirsty MacColl's penultimate album, 1994's Titanic Days. It's not just that MacColl was killed in a mysterious scuba diving accident six years later, although that is incredibly tragic. Nor is it that she mentions death in every song, although that too is part of the album's sad new context. The bittersweetness of Titanic Days lies in the fact that in the 11 years since its release, MacColl's legacy hasn't really come to much: I'd be hard-pressed to think of any artist she has strongly and directly influenced (although I like to think that Neko Case has most of MacColl's albums on her shelf), and she has yet to be rediscovered by a new generation or to experience a resurgence of nostalgia for either her early output on Stiff Records or for later albums like Kite and Electric Landlady. To American music fans she's perhaps most renowned for singing with the Pogues (""Fairytale of New York"" should be a holiday chestnut by now) and for her rendition of Cole Porter's ""Miss Otis Regrets"" on that quintessential 1990s benefit album, Red Hot & Blue. To most people she's probably just a name they've read somewhere or remember only fleetingly. But Titanic Days is immanently memorable for its sense of humor and serious expectations. MacColl possessed a songwriting wit as sharp and as humorous as Elvis Costello's, but she was vulnerable and generous where he was often caustic, as if she just couldn't commit to being the curmudgeon. On the jazz-noirish ""Bad"", she spits verses about finally breaking free of her ""token woman"" existence: ""I want a brief encounter in a stolen car/ A hand on my buttock in a Spanish bar."" And the raucous pub-country rumbler ""Big Boy on a Saturday Night"" gleefully deflates the boasts of ""a silly pseudo lager lout with nothing much to shout about."" The general consensus, however, is that Titanic Days is a divorce album, which isn't a stretch: both MacColl and collaborator Mark E. Nevin (who writes the reissue liner notes) were both enduring the ends of their marriages. That painful alienation informs almost every song here, but especially ""You Know It's You"", ""Don't Go Home"", and the title track, which ends in a cinematic coda of Technicolor strings that manages to be both melodramatic and utterly devastating. Remarkably there is no self-pitying animosity here, but plenty of adult resignation and the acknowledgement of indescribably messy emotions. ""And about all the pain,"" MacColl sings so defiantly on ""Tomorrow Never Comes"", ""Well, you know it was worth it/You could do it again/ But I just don't deserve it."" Despite the somewhat dated production, Titanic Days manages to sound both dreamily optimistic and realistically down-to-earth, measuring the distance between the hoped-for life and the lived existence. Songs like ""Soho Square"" and ""Angel"" are shot through with a anticipation for something enormous and life-changing, whether good or bad-- something, as the title proclaims, titanic. MacColl has the perfect voice for this expectancy: It's light but never ethereal, grounded but never guttural. She remains permanently rooted in the here and now, but sounds like she won't settle for that. This reissue adds to the album a second disk of twelve bonus tracks, all of which are either contemporaneous recordings or session outtakes. In addition to two b-sides, two live cuts, and three demos, there are four versions of the first single ""Angel"", which seems like overkill. The Into the Light and Apollo 440 remixes reinvent the song dramatically, but to little effect, while the relatively stripped down Piano Mix nearly bests Lillywhite's album version. Titanic Days, unfortunately, was not the big thing MacColl was waiting for. Upon its release, the album received modest praise and disappointing sales. It took MacColl six years to release a follow-up, Tropical Brainstorm, which produced a minor posthumous hit with ""In These Shoes?"" In the meantime, Titanic Days went out of print and became a sought-after rarity among serious fans and critics-- a situation now remedied by this reissue, even if it doesn't really constitute a happy ending.","ZTT reissues this 1993 LP from the late singer.

Minimum-Maximum,Kraftwerk,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1d13d197565213b249/1:1/w_160/06fcaaab.jpg,2005-06-07 06:01:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4557-minimum-maximum/,Astralwerks,"When Lester Bangs interviewed Kraftwerk for Creem in 1975, Ralf Hütter explained how the band's Menschmaschine concept influenced its concert approach: ""We use tapes, pre-recorded, and we play tapes also in our performance. When we recorded on TV we were not allowed to play a tape as part of the performance because the musicians' union felt that they would be put out of work. But I think just the opposite: With better machines, you'll be able to do better work, and you will be able to spend your time and energies on a higher level."" Thirty years later Kraftwerk certainly have better machines, and judging from the fantastic show they put in last week in Washington D.C., they've been spending their time and energy on everything but playing their instruments. The latter-day Kraftwerk live experience is total theater, an intense multimedia spectacle in which the nuts and bolts of who is doing exactly what is not only impossible to determine but completely irrelevant. So it is in a sense odd that Kraftwerk has chosen this time to release their first officially sanctioned live album. Minimum-Maximum is a collection of performances recorded in the last couple years, sequenced to closely reflect the set Kraftwerk are currently touring. Even if Minimum-Maximum is essentially a mixed-down document of whatever pre-recorded sounds the band loaded into the production's computers, it's still an excellent record for three reasons: 1. The Sound
I have Kraftwerk live bootlegs from 1971, 1975, 1981, and 1998, and the sound varies from horrid to passable. Minimum-Maximum, however, is rich, balanced, and full, reflecting the careful pre-show assembly while allowing enough room reverb and crowd noise to let you know it's a live recording. Far be it for Kraftwerk to let substandard sonics soil anything born in the Kling-Klang studio. 2. The Arrangements
While Kraftwerk do less physically live than they once did, their arrangements are constantly being tweaked, so Minimum-Maximum never feels like a playback of familiar records. One need only follow the evolution of ""Autobahn"" from a trance-inducing jam in the mid-70s that could last up to 40 minutes to the lean, effective version here that seems pop song-length at just under nine minutes. The vocal breakdown in ""Autobahn"" featuring layers of robots harmonizing on the song's theme (first introduced on The Mix) finds its way into this version, cementing the song's connection with the Beach Boys. Other shifts in focus are more subtle but still significant. The vocodered vocals on the opening ""The Man Machine"" are much more prominent, bursting forth from the speakers in a way that seems to command a fully robotic future, even as the songs backing music seems warmer and less harsh than the album version. The beats for ""Trans-Europe Express"" and the accompanying ""Metal on Metal"" are thicker and more syncopated, putting the focus of Kraftwerk's railroad homage squarely on the rhythm. The technofied songs from Tour de France Soundtracks have not surprisingly changed the least and, truthfully, ""Vitamin"" and ""Elektro Kardiogramm"" can't quite match the classics that surround them. Which leads us to the final reason Minimum-Maximum is worth your time: 3. The Songs
More than anything, Minimum-Maximum gets over because a well-chosen selection from the Kraftwerk catalog is basically unstoppable. The four-song Computer World run on the second disc is particularly powerful, arguing for a steady upward trajectory in Kraftwerk's output through 1981 and also showcasing their deadpan humor. ""It's more fun to compute"" is the ultimate Kraftwerk line, a t-shirt slogan that pokes fun at the 70s while articulating a pop-culture prescience. Indeed, the mood throughout the live show is upbeat and celebratory-- ""Having a Party With Ralf and Florian,"" if you will. The opening of ""Radioactivity"" is the only truly heavy moment, with a robotic voice intoning disturbing statistics about plutonium, but even here dance beats kick in roughly halfway through. Since Autobahn, Kraftwerk have created music in which melody and rhythm become one, and roughly two-thirds of the tracks here are perfect examples of this precise, economical aesthetic. As a career overview Minimum-Maximum far surpasses The Mix. This record's importance in the Kraftwerk story is up for debate, but there's no question it's a hell of a lot of fun.","If you haven't had the chance to see the German legends on their recent tours, this 2xCD live album hints at what you missed.

Nobody's Darlings,Lucero,by: Stephen M.

It's a free and rootless life, simultaneously unburdened and unblessed by notions of home and stability. Following the adage You have to live the life that you sing about in your song, Lucero have written about the touring life with complexity for years. On 2003's That Much Further West, Ben Nicholls sang about the strong lure of home (a faithful woman, a stable day-to-day) and the stronger call of the road, letting the contradictory emotions speak for themselves as Roy Berry's gremlin drums burst into intimate moments and pulled him even further west. The tension between stasis and movement, between permanence and transience, saturates the band's follow-up, Nobody's Darlings, produced by Jim Dickinson. That Lucero would work with the man who recorded Sister Lovers and Pleased to Meet Me seems inevitable, at least in retrospect: They've been playing and recording with his sons Cody and Luther (two-thirds of the North Mississippi All-Stars) almost since Lucero's inception. Dickinson streamlines their songs and plays up the gritty bar-band sound, emphasizing the interplay between Nicholls' and Brian Venable's guitars. If the album loses a little spark towards the end (specifically on ""California"" and ""Last Night in Town""), Lucero still sound more like a live, dynamic unit than ever on songs like ""Sixteen"" (with Berry's snare rolling out the coda) and ""Noon As Dark As Midnight"" (with its dueling guitars adding to the tense country-noir atmosphere). In addition to that collaboration, Nobody's Darlings marks the debut of the band's new label, Liberty and Lament, which they formed after Tiger Style went on indefinite hiatus and left That Much Further West with no promotional push. ""Nobody's Darlings"" is a sober nod to such disappointments: Lucero are neither critics' nor women's darlings, just some guys who play music on a stage, half-ignored by the crowd, pleased whenever someone dances along. Again, Nicholls wails with his bluesy, grainy voice, and when he sings that's he's ""happy just watching her dance,"" Berry taps out a short waltz rhythm as commentary. ""Anjalee"", the album's catchiest track, is a brave-face postcard from the road, with Nicholls sending his love to his best girl back home-- ""tell my Anjalee I love her best."" But the kicker comes at the end: ""Don't tell 'em about how I'm lonely."" Pushing his songwriting in new directions, Nicholls tries out a few narrative-driven songs, which are unpolished but still among the album's best. ""Bikeriders"" starts with a scenario that's been used a million times (in Robert Earl Keen's epic ""The Road Goes On Forever"", for instance)-- good girl meets bad boy, sparks fly-- but Nicholls tweaks it dramatically: instead of happily ever after, it's the start of a rocky relationship: ""Kathy's been with Benny Bauer ever since that night/ She's tried to leave him many times she can't quite get away/ She's seen more jails and courts and lawyers than she'd like to say."" ""The War"" is the story of (presumably) Nicholls's grandfather's tour of duty during World War II. Backed only by his ragged acoustic guitar, Nicholls tells the story slowly and patiently, setting up the details before getting to the point: the narrator would rather get demoted than send his friends to their deaths. Just as it's impossible not to read this song as a commentary on the current war, it's also impossible to miss Nicholls comparing himself to the narrator and finding himself lacking somehow. He's wondering if all the touring and all the travel and loneliness is worth it, but he's not coming up with any easy answers.","The tension between stasis and movement, permanence and transience, saturates this Memphis band's latest LP.

Down in a Mirror: A Second Tribute to Jandek,Various Artists,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c6c0084474cd0c26b4/1:1/w_160/409735e3.gif,2005-06-06 06:01:10,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4202-down-in-a-mirror-a-second-tribute-to-jandek/,Summersteps,"It's been a wild ride lately for Jandek and his small but devoted fanbase, as the past couple of years have seen an unprecedented level of activity from the legendarily reclusive Texan musician. Jandek has been prolific since his 1978 debut Ready for the House, but in the wake of Chad Friedrich's well-received 2003 documentary Jandek on Corwood the singer has ramped up his production, releasing four new albums in 2004 and two already in 2005. Most startling of all, however, has been Jandek's recent series of three (so far) live performances in Scotland and England, the first-known such concerts of his career. These appearances have sent almost literal shockwaves through his fervent fan community; the live dates serving to radically demystify the man and his abstruse, fascinating music. Though much about him remains cloaked in mystery, these live performances have put some of the more outlandish theories about his work (""He died in Vietnam, and his family is putting the records out as they can afford it"") to rest, while simultaneously sending the strong signal that Jandek remains now what he always has been: a passionate, dedicated artist whose primary intent is for his music to speak for itself. At first glance Jandek might not seem like a ripe candidate for one tribute album, let alone two, due to the idiosyncratic, deeply personalized (a cynic might add atonal or unmusical) nature of his sound. But as Summersteps Records proved on their first such collection, 2000's Naked in the Afternoon, there's something about the unvarnished emotion and dissolute, blank-slate structures of Jandek's songs that allows the covering artist enough space to add a new distinctive voice while somehow retaining each piece's essential Jandekness. And Down in a Mirror-- anchored by stellar performances from its bigger name contributors like Jeff Tweedy, Six Organs of Admittance, and the Mountain Goats-- again dips generously into the vast Corwood songbook, bringing rich and surprising rewards to the surface. As evidenced by Tweedy's melodic opening version of ""Crack a Smile"", most of the acts here have sensibly transposed Jandek's unorthodox chords and phrases into decidedly more conventional song structures. (Though some stalwart fans have apparently had the patience to attempt a faithful transcription of Jandek's bizarre, dissonant guitar tabs, this has always struck me as a fool's errand.) For his cover of ""The Dunes""-- the original of which is one of Jandek's harrowing a cappella pieces-- Sebadoh's Eric Gaffney adds darkly atmospheric folk instrumentation, while Six Organs' Ben Chasny beautifully captures the bottomless solitude of ""I'll Sit Alone and Think About You"" utilizing his trademark Takoma-bred virtuosity. Other standouts here include Acid Mothers Temple's Makoto Kawabata recasting ""Babe I Love You"" in dazzling, sky-high drones, Okkervil River's impassioned take on the obsessive ""Your Other Man"", and Brother JT-- a man eminently deserving of his own tribute album-- giving ""Message to the Clerk"" a delightfully dizzy psych-folk spin. Not surprisingly most of the contributors here tend to fall into the scrambled singer-songwriter archetype, with Home for the Def's goofy hip-hop/rockabilly medley of ""Cave In On You/European Jewel"" probably qualifying as the set's biggest stylistic leap. Unfortunately, the voices contained here are also universally male, giving the listener the perhaps not entirely inaccurate impression that Jandek's fanbase is predominantly a boy's club. (What, you're telling me that women aren't much into spooky loners anymore?) This uniformity of voice and style does risk monotony over the course of the album's 21 tracks, but let's face it, the same thing could be (and has been) said about Jandek's entire back catalog, and that certainly doesn't appear to be bothering his productivity any.","Jeff Tweedy, Six Organs of Admittance, and the Mountain Goats head this second tribute to Jandek.

X&Y,Coldplay,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61ec0084474cd0c08a8/1:1/w_160/5c85d723.jpg,2005-06-06 06:01:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1541-xy/,Capitol,"""Don't Panic"", the opening track of Coldplay's first album, drew its title from the famous motto of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novels. Two albums later, it seems they chose the wrong Adams catchphrase; most of their recorded output is better exemplified by the Guide's description of Earth: ""Mostly harmless."" In their seven years together, Coldplay have risen to monumental levels of popularity on a potent mixture of nice-guy charm, serviceable songwriting, and general inoffensiveness. Unfortunately, these aren't the kind of traits that often lead to interesting music. Not that the band hasn't taken the occasional stabs at creativity and innovation; it's just that those attempts have always been carefully measured, or even nervously self-conscious. Coldplay have never seemed intent on world domination, but as their early singles caught on, journalists came waving raves. Then, with nearly 5 million copies of Parachutes sold worldwide and their popularity on the upswing, the band's sophomore album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, found the band unsure of how to advance. Luckily for them, their decision to virtually recreate Parachutes on a larger budget paid off commercially: The album got them tagged as ""the next U2,"" a ridiculously off-base coronation that ignores the fact that U2 recorded ""I Will Follow"", ""New Year's Day"", ""Bad"", and The Joshua Tree, among others, before they wandered off into the MOR wilderness. Coldplay, meanwhile, started in the middle of the road and haven't strayed since. Granted, they've produced a handful of good songs-- ""Don't Panic"", ""Shiver"", and ""The Scientist"" are all fine achievements, while ""Clocks"" remains a great piano part in search of an equally great melody-- but their albums have yet to justify the critical hyperbole, and their third full-length, X&Y;, isn't going to be the one to lock that down. Though dressed to the nines in big guitars and faultless musicianship, X&Y; is unable to lay claim to even a single song equal to any of the high points from their first two albums, and the band's obvious desire to be all things to all people doesn't help: They long to be huge and expansive, in The Unforgettable Fire mode (""A Message""), tear-jerking AOR balladeers (""Fix You""), and hip, Kraftwerk-referencing aesthetes (""Talk""), but at heart, they're really built for easy listening, which makes their rockers feel cursory and their ballads simpering. X&Y; is sequenced fast-song/slow-song through almost its entire running order, which means those of you uninterested in wading through doe-eyed love songs based on lazy rhyming couplets and trite resolutions have already lost half a disc's worth of music. You'll ""go backwards and then/ You'll go forwards again."" You'll ""get lost and then get found."" You'll notice that the first verse of ""Swallowed in the Sea"" (""You cut me down a tree/ And brought it back to me/ And that's what made me see/ Where I was coming from"") is somehow meaningless, yet also cliched. Had Coldplay accompanied these lyrics with remotely interesting or memorable music, this could be somewhat overlooked; sadly, ""Swallowed in the Sea"" is one of several aggressively banal ballads that sink this album into a sort of neo-Carpenters abyss. The more uptempo tracks here tend to be light years better than their leaden counterparts, if only because the louder accompaniment manages to drown out more of Chris Martin's lyrics and bring the focus to his pleasant if unspectacular vocals. Guitarist John Buckland does his part to bring life to the proceedings: He's an encyclopedia of Will Sergeant and Johnny Marr-isms, and even if most of his window dressings are little more than a distillation of tricks learned from better bands, he does a nice job of providing the illusion of a grand gesture for songs like ""Square One"" and ""White Shadows"". Martin's vocals, meanwhile, rarely command attention, content to melt into the string synthesizer and guitar reverb as if he hopes he's not imposing on you. Listening back to an earlier track like ""Shiver"" proves he's capable of more. Lending to the uninspired nature is lead single ""Speed of Sound""'s uncanny resemblance to ""Clocks"". Certainly, it rarely hurts to stick with what works, but this is not just a near-exact replica of its successful predecessor; it's also a less memorable song riding a piano hook that has so deeply infiltrated the pop-culture landscape that I've become numb to it. In fairness, the track's vocal melody outperforms the one from ""Clocks"" by a hair, but without a strong hook, the song fails in the one category it needs to succeed in: replay value. It's symptomatic of the rest of the album, and indeed, much of the band's catalog to date: Like Coldplay's two previous albums, only more so, X&Y; is bland but never offensive, listenable but not memorable. It may be pointless to hate them, but with this album, they've almost certainly become the easiest band on the planet to be completely indifferent to.","Coldplay have risen to massive popularity on a potent mixture of nice-guy charm, serviceable songwriting, and edgelessness. With this, their third album, they dig in their heels and deliver more of the same.

Fuzzy Logic / Radiator / Out Spaced / Guerilla / Mwng,Super Furry Animals,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a220b1335d7bf169840f/1:1/w_160/a8c2126a.jpg,2005-06-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11835-fuzzy-logic-radiator-out-spaced-guerilla-mwng/,Creation,"""These days, rock tends to be retro by default,"" a recent piece in The New York Times opined. That's obvious, but it doesn't go far enough. Most rock these days also tends to be slavishly monochromatic, whatever its template-- all the easier to file under nu-wave, nu-metal, post-rock, prog-rock, roots-rock, frat-rock, pop-punk, power-pop, hardcore, emo, screamo, post-screamo, or Gwyneth Paltrow-humping Radiohead-lite. Rare is the act that actually pulls together disparate threads for a sound that visits more than one or two of contemporary rock's Intarweb-abetted ghettoes. Wales' Super Furry Animals are such a band. Like anyone, these multilingual electro-psych-glam-pop/rock pranksters have influences, amply documented on their 2005 Under the Influence comp: post-Pet Sounds Beach Boys, Electric Light Orchestra, the MC5, Underworld, Joey Beltram and...opera? Well, maybe. The difference is that SFA borrow their heroes' doggedly original aesthetic values as much as their easy sonic trademarks. Together, singer Gruff Rhys, guitarist Huw ""Bunf"" Bunford, bassist Guto Pryce, keyboardist Cian Ciárán, and drummer Dafydd Ieuan have crafted six anarchically experimental albums. Their label recently saw fit to reissue four of them, with bonus tracks, plus odds-and-sods comp Out Spaced. 1996's Fuzzy Logic introduced the world to the Super Furries' candy-factory chameleon act. Opener ""God! Show Me Magic"" wastes no time, kicking off practically mid-riff to the type of synth-laced punk-pop Supergrass or even Oasis fans could probably understand. The album's most infectious sing-along, ""Something 4 the Weekend"", appears here in a more rambunctious take than on the near-perfect single version. The album's lyrics span hamsters, ""soul transplants,"" UFOs, village idiots, and ""Hometown Unicorn"" (a more psychedelic take on Blur's ""This Is a Low""). The woozy Pipers-era Floyd of ""Gathering Moss"" swells into the poignant strings of ""If You Don't Want Me to Destroy You"". The latter half of the record is less consistent, but the slanted pop of ""Mario Man"" and the hazy ""Long Gone"" are still inimitably, idiosyncratically SFA. A year later, Radiator saw the band beginning to master the art of the album. The song structure and production continue to increase in complexity-- encompassing piano-ballad melancholia, self-destructing folktronica, Bowie art-rock, and the punk urgency of the Jam or Buzzcocks-- but the sun-kissed '60s pop hooks remain as accessible as ever. Rhys's seeming joy in his own strangeness stirs sugar into the album's chemical cocktail, rendering songs about goat-sucking vampires, Marie Curie, and military coups in Sierra Leone surprisingly easy to swallow. Many would rank this as the band's finest album. But that's Guerrilla. From the single-worthy supermarket psych of hidden pre-opening track ""Citizens Band"" to the long-delayed cymbal crash of brief final hidden track ""Chewing Chewing Gum (Reprise)"", 1999's Guerrilla takes the group's long-standing whimsicality to its logic-warping extreme. In their earliest days, SFA formed as a techno group, and Guerrilla sees those impulses merging with the band's previous sunny guitar-pop. Here the group do seemingly everything, and well: near-perfect sunny pop (""Do or Die""), soaring Brit balladry that makes slow service a kind of apotheosis (""Turning Tide""), horn-laden tropicalia (""Northern Lites""), floor-slapping LSD-infused electronica (""Wherever I Lay My Phone""), hula-dancing drum-and-bass (""The Door to This House Remains Open"") and country endearments (""Fire in My Heart""). The album's many gags and eccentricities, like opener ""Check It Out"" or the 22-second oddity of ""The Sound of Life Today"", give it the playful feel of a hip-hop record, with its requisite skits. Guerrilla is an alternate universe to get lost in. Between Radiator and Guerrilla, the Super Furries released Out Spaced, which culls together Fuzzy Logic B-sides and tracks from their earliest EPs. Like UK contemporaries Oasis, Blur, or Radiohead, SFA boast plenty of non-album tracks that stand up to their strongest material. Out Spaced is, along with later singles comp Songbook, sequenced as an album rather than chronologically, and leads with riotously profane Steely Dan-sampling single ""The Man Don't Give a Fuck"". Two tracks later, the vaguely danceable ""Smokin'"" has a similarly repetitive, unwholesome tagline: ""I just want to smoke it."" ""Don't Be a Fool, Billy"" could sit comfortably beside any of the band's up-tempo songs, while ""Carry the Can"" is a good-naturedly bombastic ballad the likes of ""Turning Tide"" or ""It's Not the End of the World"". A few of the songs are in Welsh, such as the strangely compelling 11-minute closing track, spell-check-defying ""'Blewytirhwng?"", but everything the Super Furries do could be in another language. Especially when, as on ""Blewytirhwng?"" (thanks, copy-and-paste!), it's actually in another language. Like, what'd I say, Welsh? SFA recorded 2000's largely acoustic Mwng entirely in that ancient Brithonic tongue, and it's-- startlingly-- as easy to enjoy as their English works. Single ""Ysbeidiau Heulog"", which predicted the wooly-bully ? and the Mysterians garage rock of bands like the Caesars, is the standout, but sinuous pop melodies and organic arrangements that do more with less than the band's usual studio wizardry make for an exciting discovery almost all the way through. The chutes-and-ladders chorus of ""Ymaelodi â'r Ymylon"" is a particular favorite. So yeah, like I mentioned earlier, these reissues include some bonus tracks, too. As is generally the case with lost B-sides, they're really just for hardcore fans. But many of those listeners will be overjoyed to discover songs that somehow missed the Out Spaced cut: perky, Spinal Tap-referencing ""Waiting to Happen"" from the extended Fuzzy Logic; Syd Barrett-esque alphabet song ""No K"", optimistic Jurassic space-rocker ""Hit and Run"", and bright classic ""Wrap It Up"" (""They call me the dealer/ I mean I deals in ideals"") from Radiator. Guerrilla's offerings pale beside the original album, but do manage to scratch the itch for more SFA: shiny, distorted mid-tempo number ""This, That and the Other"", piano-accented bounder ""Missunderstanding (sic), and the inescapably sha-la-la-ing ""Colorblind"". Mwng comes with a bonus disc, but it's the same one North American listeners got upon its initial release, featuring ""Sali Mali"" and ""Calimero"". Where does this leave the Super Furries' legacy? Newbies should probably still start with the just-out singles compilation, Songbook. Then, despite getting short shrift in some circles, 2001 major-label debut Rings Around the World is the next entry point, adhering to the catch-all Guerrilla template and tossing in some of the group's catchiest, most accessible songs in the bargain. But notice all those 8's up there: The Super Furries have recorded so much great music, but their limitless sonic adventurism has never yielded an album that was completely unassailable-- even Guerrilla. Maybe that's too much to expect, or contrary to the band's don't-give-a-fuck vision. Surely the Perfect Album rock ideal isn't ""retro""? In the wake of 2003's disappointing Phantom Power, some of us still hold out hope. After all, as Rhys sings at the end of Fuzzy Logic: ""We'll be together/ For now and ever"".","Vital 2xCD reissues of the first four Super Furry Animals LPs (with appropriate B-sides), plus the Out Spaced comp.

You might argue that Weezer's Make Believe drew a 0.4 just for sharing a name with a Kinsella project, although sucking mightily probably had something to do with it. I've always found Joan of Arc's artified emo shockfests to be insufferable, but today, the Devil is ordering a personalized Make Believe Neighborhoodie to fend off a sudden cold snap: I'm dropping some Forkian love on Kinsella. Schreiber's gonna hate me (Ryan, did I ever tell you that I regard you as the Lewis Lapham of indie?). What's interesting is that Make Believe's debut EP isn't even a deviation from Kinsella's usual noodle-rock screamifying-- the band is essentially Joan of Arc playing non-JOA songs-- it's simply a streamlined, rawked out version of the same. If there's nothing here a Joan of Arc fan wouldn't recognize as Kinsella fare, there's also surprisingly little that would lead a gimlet-eyed hipster to make the international sign for ""gag me with a spoon."" Take opening track ""We're All Going to Die"". The lyrics are aiming high, and Kinsellas, ever the postmodernist, manages to sustain his truism and tautology laden screed on the denaturing of language for the duration. But screw the lyrics; the guitar sound is out of this world. ""We're All Going to Die"" is comprised of squelchy knots of squealing melody, and sounds like it was written forwards, played backwards and recorded forwards again. The off-kilter drums and intensely prickly guitars are connected by slick, simmering bridges; it all comes off as psychedelic, proggy, or mathy depending on your age and tastes, but I've got to point out that if there's such a thing as post-screamo, this is it. Same goes for ""Britt's Favorite"", which opens with warm, splintering arpeggios that gradually cohere into a fizzy 4/4 stomp. These are the highest highs, and a whole EP this focused might have earned Kinsella a previously unthinkable 7.0. The other three tracks are more piecemeal, and while the parts that work are potent, the ones that don't are a little too JOA for comfort. But overall, this is a solid fifteen-minute thrill ride from a dude I thought was only capable of Willy Wonka-style terror cruises.","Debut EP from the new band featuring Pitchfork fave Tim Kinsellas.

Memphis Bleek is, like Game, a derivative, artless MC with enormous resources, but he doesn't have a great album in him. Memphis Bleek has released four forgettable albums on Roc-A-Fella records while stronger artists like M.O.P. and Ol' Dirty Bastard moldered on the shelf. His greatest track and only hit remains ""Is That Yo Bitch?"", a song Jay-Z scrapped from his Vol. 3 album, and one that features Jigga and Missy Elliott in starring roles. Bleek has never gone platinum, and he probably never will. And yet Jay keeps him around. That's loyalty for you. Bleek has stood onstage for Jay for nearly a decade without ever absorbing any of his mentor's effortless, swaggering elan or thoughtful, melancholy eloquence. He has a harsh, urgent, forceful flow; it's good for guest verses on battle-rap posse tracks, but it wears thin over the course of a single song, let alone an album. 534 features A-list producers such as Just Blaze and 9th Wonder, but Bleek rarely holds up his part of the track. His voice sounds OK over the exploding drums and surging horns of Swizz Beatz' club banger ""Like That"", but he derails the track with his staggeringly lame party-rap lyrics (""Slow motion for me, like ya ass was screwed up / Make you move like The Matrix when dude was ducking slugs/ Bleek the Black Sheep, mami, now pick it up""). On a sweeping, cinematic track like 9th Wonder's ""Alright"", he's just bizarrely terrible (""Don't confuse M with none of the bullshit/ To the streets I'm tied like my mama's tubes is""). On an already lame track like Demi-Doc and Irv Gotti's tinkly, watery thug-love snoozer ""Infatuated"", he falls even flatter, failing to project even the slightest hint of affection. He doesn't switch his flow up once over the course of the album, and he can't write a hook. Only a few tracks on 534 play to Bleek's strengths. He's happiest spitting gutter battle stuff, and he sounds best when he has better rappers to play off of, and that's exactly what he gets on ""First, Last and Only"", sandwiched between berserk gun-talk of Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P. And along with his new protégé Livin' Proof, he murders Chad Hamilton's rippling old-school bounce track on ""Get Low"". (Proof has a greasy, desperate side-of-the-mouth delivery, and it's depressing to contemplate the possibility that Memphis Bleek may be the first rapper to be overshadowed by both his mentor and his protégé.) But 534's best track is ""Dear Summer"", wherein Jay-Z calmly and gracefully bids farewell to his favorite time of year over Just Blaze's dusty, Madlib-influenced lope. ""Like all good things, we must come to an end/ Please show the same love to my friends,"" Jay pleads at the end of the track. Jay wants Bleek to succeed, and he usually gets what he wants, but the best thing about ""Dear Summer"" is that Bleek is nowhere to be found.","The veteran Roc-A-Fella soldier still can't improve his rank.

Bitter Hands Resign,A Northern Chorus,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c0ea9e61561daa488d/1:1/w_160/19e4ba91.jpg,2005-06-05 06:01:16,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/476-bitter-hands-resign/,Sonic Unyon,"There's cultural product you enjoy and cultural product you admire; either will suffice under the right circumstances, although the ideal is for both to be wrapped up in one package. Here's a basic exemplary schema: J.K. Rowling (enjoy), Jacques Derrida (admire), Elmore Leonard (both). Star Wars Episode III (enjoy), My Dinner with Andre (admire), Kung Fu Hustle (both). The schema breaks down vis-á-vis television, which lacks the patience for the (admire) category, but holds up against orchestral indie rock: Explosions in the Sky (enjoy), A Northern Chorus (admire), Godspeed You! Black Emperor (both). What makes the (admire) category worthwhile is that you can learn from or be challenged by it-- in other words, while fun is, well, fun, it's not the only sensation we seek from our artistic diversions. We also crave to be provoked and disturbed and psychically reoriented. Since there's not much that Bitter Hands Resign has to teach me, and since its dramatic maneuvers are too soothing and commonplace (if competently executed) to challenge any of my assumptions or sensibilities, I can only admire it in an abstract way. But if it's a musical massage you're after, and more to the point, if you like the idea of Coldplay's Chris Martin singing for Explosions in the Sky, this third LP from Ontario sextet A Northern Chorus will be the object of your pleasure and esteem. Resonating with Pink Floyd's cold and swirling qualities, EITS's delicate textural layers, Godspeed's epic thrust and Sigur Rós's inexorable freeze, A Northern Chorus has turned out the record that Death Cab for Cutie might make after taking an online classical composition course and a near-fatal overdose of tranquilizer cocktails. The long, dramatic arcs of languid guitar, weepy cello, silky organs, and lugubrious percussion are overstated in a necessary way, but grandiosity works better musically than lyrically, and I'd have preferred this album without the breathy, direly grave falsettos. I'm saying: When you're taking an ice bath, the last thing you need is someone reminding you how cold it is, and lines like ""Angels are on their way out/ They'll lead us through the darkness to the right place"" (as warbled over the gentle, trebly percolation of ""Subjects & Matter"") seem to overstate a case for hope in the face of modern dread that the music tacitly makes on its own, that's already been made by similar musics many times over. But like I said in a recent Album Leaf review, it's really about headspace-- if you're in the right one, this sad-sack skygaze epic will trickle dazzling colors across your firmament.","Like Coldplay's Chris Martin singing for Explosions in the Sky.

Brigadoon,P:ano,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a198b1335d7bf16982d1/1:1/w_160/89e436dc.jpg,2005-06-05 06:01:15,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6574-brigadoon/,Mint,"First off, name's P:ano. The music, like the moniker, is unnatural, an aberration: Diverse Fiery Furnaces hyperprog with the high-school theatricality of the Decemberists or Antony & the Johnsons and the pop-classicist impulses of Heikki, Hercules, Camera Obscura, or Fan Modine. Hazlewood and Sinatra! Rodgers and Hammerstein! Architecture and Helsinki! On the first few listens, the songs wash by, disembodied like an ocean. They pass over as a wave of ephemeral cleverness. Eventually strong, if eccentric, songwriting emerges, establishing the band as a more-remote cousin to recent Memphis Industries baroque-pop signing Field Music. (Why haven't you downloaded that yet, BTW?) If the references seem dizzying, it's surely by P:ano's design. On Brigadoon, their third album, the Vancouver-based group of Nick Krgovich, Larissa Loyva, Justin Kellam, and Julia Chirka bask in 22 songs for 54 minutes, spanning at least as many influences along with instruments ranging from primitive Magnetic Fields electro-bleeps to strings, horns, handclaps and zithers. So when Krgovich intones slowly, in a Ben Foldsian everydude voice, ""I turned the orchestra loose,"" on the fabulous ""O.C."", the sadness is palpable. ""You would've off and left me anyway, believe me,"" he adds in unconsoling consolation, which the ghostly ""Cameroon"" echoes a track later. Horse-like clip-clops provide additional ornamentation on songs like ""You the Widow"" and ""Sweets"", developing a ridiculously quirky theme that builds into Mancini-swoon centerpiece ""Georgey the Horsey"" (a reference to Vancouver predecessor Good Horsey?) and Krgovich's slyly disconsolate, ""Will you trade me in for a new Shetland pony friend?"" To complicate matters, the songs sometimes unfold at the deliberate pace of Low. Given the capriciousness here and the occasional ""rumpa-pum-pum"", think Christmas EP, particularly on the album's standout, ""The Snow"", with a tin-pan alley verse and a jingling, reverb-laden chorus. Co-lead vocalist Loyva sings with the quiet, gorgeously real whisper of Yo La Tengo's drummer/singer Georgia Hubley, quaintly adapted for stage (the album title is, after all, a reference to a Lerner & Loewe musical). Above the swooping guitars of ""Candy Is Nice"", she steers the band into dreamy chamber-pop, Krgovich's backing vocals echoing like those of My Morning Jacket's Jim James. Yet Loyva has the humor to proclaim, ""Take me to funky town!"" on faster-paced potential single ""Leave Me With the Boy"". (Don't worry, the room's spinning for me, too.) On ""Pure Evil"", the words ""Fleetwood Mac"" and ""Christine McVie"" spring to mind, pleasantly. Though the album has a few tracks too many-- ""The Rescuer"" drags and ""The Ghost Pirates"" cloys-- it's hard to fault this band for their ambition. With a train-like rhythm, ""Light o' Love"" hearkens romantically to a turn-of-the-20th-century America that probably never really existed-- despite the Mind Games-era Lennon saxophone, ""Somebody Get Me Annette"" is strangely fascinating (bassoon!), and the meticulously cool (temperature-wise) ""Dark Hills"" hits like a half-remembered Alan Parsons production from '80s soft-rock radio, aside from the ethereal backing vocals and marching-band martiality. A few stronger choruses, and P:ano, despite their strange appellation and forbidding obtuseness, could go on to fashion the album of next year. Or they could end up another vaguely celebrated post-Elephant 6 omnivourous weirdness collective. Dudes, I just write shit.","Another week, another hyperprog album; this one marries theatricality and pop-classicist impulses.

Multiples,Keith Fullerton Whitman,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa26ea9e61561daa5b56/1:1/w_160/2308cd36.jpg,2005-06-05 06:01:14,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8664-multiples/,Kranky,"Last November Sub Rosa released An Anthology of Noise & Electronic Music: Third A-Chronology, the label's latest 2xCD document of the history of electronic music. Tucked between tracks by capital-C Composers like Bernard Parmegiani and Ilhan Mimaroglu was Keith Whitman's ""Stereo Music For Serge Modular Prototype"", recorded in 2003 and also included here on Multiples. That Whitman was included among pioneers like Parmegiani wasn't unusual given the vision of Sub Rosa's compilation; label founder Guy Marc Hinant explicitly sets out to explore connections between early electronics composers and artists working today (which isn't always to the good-- Vol. 3 contains a lame Hotel Morgan outtake from To Rococo Rot). But the circumstances surrounding the creation of ""Stereo Music For Serge Modular Prototype"" made it an interesting choice for inclusion. The piece, like this album, was recorded primarily on vintage equipment at Harvard University's Studio for Electro-Acoustic Composition, in which Whitman set up shop during a teaching residency. Electronic music was born and raised in academia in part because only large research institutions could afford the machinery. Most early electronic composers had either a university or government appointment and electronic music was seen as an extension of developments in ""serious"" classical music. Whitman on the other hand came on the scene working as Hrvatski in the late 199,0s making aggressive drum'n'bass, a street-level form originally assembled using the cheapest tools. There's something fascinating about a musician weaned on home computers returning to a grand old school sound laboratory. Not sure if it's intentional, but the sequence of Multiples mirrors developments in electronic music in the second half the 20th Century. On the album's first few tracks the music has an antiquated air, the creaks and drones touching on subconscious associations with mid-century futurism, a time when we figured technology would eventually solve all our problems. Early tracks reference the exploratory roots of the genre, with an emphasis on abrupt dynamic shifts and timbres that reflect the physical properties of electricity. As with David Toop's book Ocean of Sound, it all starts with the gamelan. ""Stereo Music for Hi-Hat"" takes the resonance of a cymbal and slows it to gong speed, conveying the ritual of the Javanese form with clouds of metallic harmonics that seem to hang in the air. Parts one and three of ""Stereo Music for Serge Modular Prototype"" use a sound palette pulled Pierre Schaeffer et al., at the Radiodiffusion-Television Francaise, with white noise electro-wind and jarring squelches from outer space that allow you to see knobs being twisted by human hands. These are the sounds that sent sci-fi film composers in search of the future of music. By the time we get to ""Stereo Music for Yamaha Disklavier Prototype"" Multiples hits its minimalism phase, as an opening burse of noise dissolves into a looped series of piano notes that brings immediately to mind Steve Reich's late-60s phase pieces. The influence of Reich, Glass and Riley is everywhere in the last ten years, obviously, but ""...Yamaha Disklavier Prototype"" is a neat demonstration of how Whitman is able to put such familiar influences to original use. As the piece builds and the layers of piano begin to overlap he introduces a subtle melancholy melody that starts low but eventually overwhelms the loops. Though its roots come from carefully applied formalism, the piece develops a tactile theatrical drama. ""Stereo Music for Farfisa Compact Duo Deluxe, Drum Kit"" has the same sort of neo-tribal Popol Vuh feel as the Antithesis EP's ""Schnee"", using a dark, gothic organ a simple drum groove, and then Whitman saves the best for last with the two-part ""Stereo Music for Acoustic Guitar, Buchla Music Box 100, Hewlett Packaard Model 236 Oscillator, Electric Guitar and Computer."" The tracks flow one into the next over the course of 16 minutes, moving from the minimalism hinted at earlier in the record into a sublime distillation of the possibilities in modern signal processing. Another repetitive melodic pattern, this time on acoustic guitar, gradually transforms into a primordial soup of computer bleeps, clicks, and eventually, thin tendrils of gauzy drone. Here forbearers are Markus Popp and Nobukazu Takemura, though again Whitman's spin is carefully designed to maximize emotional impact. The tail end of this long piece is the most purely beautiful five minutes of sound I've heard in a couple years at least. Throughout the record Whitman, while using the hardware and approach of early electronic masters, has a songwriter's ear for structure and a commitment to human warmth. Whatever their vintage, these machines sing.","Whitman's latest seems to be sequenced to mirror the developments in electronic music in the second half the 20th century.

Get Behind Me Satan,The White Stripes,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa1ab1335d7bf16995f0/1:1/w_160/fe55ed12.gif,2005-06-05 06:01:13,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8653-get-behind-me-satan/,V2,"White Stripes fans have always known that the time would eventually come when Jack White's abilities and ambitions would outpace the duo's deliberately limited musical vocabulary. And while it may be too soon to proclaim that fated day to be at hand, there are definitely signs on their bold, bewildering fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, that Jack might be beginning to strain a bit at his self-fashioned yoke. As far back as their Sympathy for the Record Industry days, the Stripes have been a considerably stranger act than is generally acknowledged-- their tender, borderline-twee childhood narratives, Cole Porter allusions, and dogged devotion to white tees and Santa pants have flown in the face of a garage-punk orthodoxy largely dictated by the iconography of 50s-era B-movies and trashy pulp paperbacks. Still, the group's past digressions were only faint foreshadowing compared to the ones that populate Get Behind Me Satan. Here Jack and Meg have made an almost-entirely clean break with the jet-fueled blues-rock of Elephant and De Stijl, forsaking electric guitar on all but a couple of tracks to instead work with pianos, acoustic guitars, marimbas, and other assorted oddball percussion. But even with this reconfigured instrumentation, the Stripes can't resist finding new ways to place unnecessary constrictions onto their work, as evidenced by the fact that Get Behind Me Satan was written, recorded, and released at an extreme breakneck pace. As legend has it, none of these tracks were even fully written before the band entered Third Man Studios in March, and unfortunately, several songs bear the scars of their needlessly rushed delivery. Although raw, combustible immediacy has always been a part of the White Stripes' charm, at some point Jack's desire for spontaneity could resemble sheer cussed laziness, and here the duo have granted a discouraging amount of real estate to what feel like unfinished sketches or works-in-progress. Jack has cryptically described these songs as an exploration of ""characters and the ideal of truth,"" which apparently can be translated to despair-- and lots of it. There's none of the sunny, innocent optimism of ""Apple Blossom"" or ""We're Going to Be Friends"" to leaven Satan's mood; virtually every track drips with loneliness, alienation, and betrayal. Even the album's most outwardly playful song, the bluegrass-tinged ""Little Ghost"", features a narrator so desperate in his isolation that he falls in love with an apparition. (""When I held you I was really holding air."") Still, a slight sting of venom appears to suit Jack well, and-- perhaps as testament to his time spent with Loretta Lynn-- Satan finds him delivering his most expressive and nuanced vocal performances to date. Oddly, two of the album's most jarring tracks are among the few to feature electric guitar. The opening ""Blue Orchid"" maintains the Stripes' impressive streak of stellar singles, as Jack's wild falsetto and processed, strangely electronic-sounding guitar combine for a heightened, spiteful crunch that's unlike anything they've ever done. And even that sounds tame compared to the accusatory ""Red Rain"", on which the singer-- his voice thick with quavering distortion-- angrily confronts his betrayer (""If there's a lie/ Then there's a liar too/ And if there's a sin/ Then there's a sinner too"") with a spellbinding intensity, while a lurching floor of chiming toy bells and Hawaiian slide guitar spins beneath him. Also exceptional is ""My Doorbell"", a strutting piano soul number that contains the album's most immediately nagging melodic hook over Meg's effectively funky cavewoman stomp. Meg also contributes surprisingly subtle hand percussion to the quietly self-loathing folk of ""Ugly As I Seem""-- a song that illustrates that the gulf separating Jack from freak-folk artists like Six Organs' Ben Chasny or Devendra Banhart may not be as wide as it seems-- and what sounds like tympani to the majestic ""Take, Take, Take"", an ambitious, Who-like piece that follows an obsessive fan as he asks one favor too many of Rita Hayworth. Unfortunately, tracks like ""The Nurse"" crumble beneath closer scrutiny, due to their over-emphasis on clever interior rhyming (""the maid that you've hired could never conspire to kill"") and soft-focused melodies that never seem able to make their way to the exits. Other misfires include ""Forever for Her (Is Over for Me)"" and ""I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet)"", two great titles that undoubtedly deserve better treatment than they're given here, and the mercifully brief ""Passive Manipulation"" which again begs the gentle suggestion that Meg not be allowed to sing lead. Even with a generous handful of tracks that easily rank alongside the White Stripes' best work, Get Behind Me Satan remains a confounding record, one that wears its ""transitional album"" tag like a heavy peppermint-striped crown. One can't help but feel that if perhaps the White Stripes had seen fit to take the necessary time to give cuts like ""Forever for Her"" or ""The Denial Twist"" a sincere revision or two, we might've been looking at a stone classic. As it stands, there's more than enough here to give Stripes fans cause to celebrate, although it may not inspire much faith that the duo will ever find the patience necessary to deliver upon their promising new innovations.","On their fifth album, the White Stripes' ambitions finally seem to outpace their limited musical vocabulary. Making an almost-entirely clean break with the jet-fueled blues-rock of Elephant and De Stijl, they forsake electric guitar on all but a couple of tracks, working instead with pianos, acoustic guitars, marimbas, and other assorted oddball percussion.

1988,Blueprint,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4889d034d5c69bf30c5/1:1/w_160/b1b88e09.jpg,2005-06-02 06:01:40,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1161-1988/,Rhymesayers,"Blueprint's Tips for Takin' It Back to '88: 1. Name album 1988. 2. Use the number ""88"" 13 times in your intro. 3. Crib samples or lyrics from classic cuts (""Road to the Riches"", ""Tramp"", ""Welcome to the Terrordome"") from 1988, or any other Golden Year that is suitable. If the source song is about finding a way out of the ghetto, make yours about your charitable fucking of both fat and skinny girls. If it's about women reclaiming power from a patriarchal society, make it about schemin' bitches. Fractured existentialism? Fuck that! Talk about how everyone jocks your shit and denigrate anyone who hasn't bought your album. 4. Name a song ""Boom-Box"". Sample Sal from Do the Right Thing bugging out (no pun intended) because Radio Raheem has ""Fight the Power"" on blast in his pizzeria. Reference Radio Raheem in your lyrics to make sure the listeners get what you're saying. Pretend you've never seen the film. Talk about how awesome your boom box is and how it's really loud, much louder than some other dude's boom box. 5. Sample drum break from ""Sucker MCs"". At the end of the song, say, ""It's like that."" This is a double reference to Run-DMC's first single. It's from 1983, but still, cred factor is super large. 6. Here's a doozy! Reference Richard Wright's Native Son in the title of a song. Now, model the storytelling style of your rhyme after Slick Rick's ""Children's Story"" (1989*, so close). Instead of the sticky social commentary and needless violence, talk about how some kid accidentally steals computers from the building that employs his mom as a cleaning lady.* 7. Okay, while you're on the heavy tip, every album needs at least two ""think pieces."" This is an independent label thing. Keeps internet fans happy. With that in mind, serious song numero dos should be about the police. You don't really need to say much other than cops are racist murderers and how you aren't going out like that. White dudes love that shit. Sample some Richard Pryor at the end. He was the Dave Chappelle of the 80s. 8. Speaking of white dudes, put one on your record. Aesop Rock is good. Let him spit a hook or something. We're losing the thread of 1988 concept here, but it was tenuous to begin with. 9. Use the tugboat horns from Biz Markie's ""Vapors"" and make your voice sound like Masta Ace. Juice Crew! Back on track with the 1988, bitch! 10. Bookend the album with uplifting songs called something like ""Anything Is Possible"" or ""Liberated"", but feel free to just talk about how everyone jocks your shit. Make sure everyone knows that they jock your shit. 11. Finally, because you're going to be on an independent label, this puts you in the ""underground,"" whatever that is. It's important that you put up a veil of respect for the ""old school."" Your beats need to be dirty and sampled. You can talk about bitches, hoes, getting money, crime and shit, but don't get too innovative with the production. It's a tip-off that you're trying to sell out. The underground is about taking it back to the ""essence"" of hip-hop, not innovation.","Blueprint's Tips for Takin' It Back to '88:

Burner,Odd Nosdam,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba369d034d5c69bf53f1/1:1/w_160/638e24c9.gif,2005-06-02 06:01:21,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6089-burner/,Anticon,"Odd Nosdam's Burner is a digest of field recordings, Moog synths, staticky samples, and scattershot drums, all waxing and waning around immovable slabs of buzzing bass. It splits the difference between the eschatological IDM of Boards of Canada's Geogaddi and Keith Fullerton Whitman's coruscating dronescapes. There are loads of sounds embedded in Burner. For instance, what's that thing called, with the bridge of electricity running between two antennae? Zzzzhk! Zzzzhk! Jacob's Ladder, I think. That's on there, among the layered angelic harmonies of ""Untitled One"". There are also clamoring crowds, car alarms, banging gavels, laughing children, lawn sprinklers, plentiful variations on static, and what one might call white noise, if one erroneously believed that white noise was just any old racket (it's not). There are also some uninteresting sounds: More than once, Nosdam juxtaposes his kaleidoscopic drone against samples from old educational recordings, which has been done to death in instrumental hip-hop and electronic collage-based music. If interesting sounds aren't enough for you there are many cameos, and a weird sort of crossover aspect to the record. Two songs, ""11th Ave Freakout"" parts one and two, crib their titles from Fog's recent LP, although Andrew Broder appears on neither the shimmering first part, replete with sampled beatdown sounds and a Vanilla Ice sample, or part two, where Mike Patton and Why? add vocal harmonies to Nosdam's spiraling synths. But Broder does contribute, along with Múm's Orvar Smarason, to ""Small Mr. Man Pants"", a peristaltic pulse teeming with whistles, horns, and woodwinds. The song-- named for Nosdam's old group cLOUDDEAD-- finds Liz Hosdon's long, sonorous syllables paddling in a bassy soup, and Jessica Bailiff adds some layered vocals to the clipped electric bolts of ""Untitled Three"" and the closing epic ""Flying Saucer Attack"". You've heard music like this before: The saturation of sound seems to conjure some amorphous pre-conscious roar; the samples and cadences scan as a Futurist ode to the din of city life; and the results can be read, grandiosely, as a timeless distillation of human consciousness, or, more modestly, as a literal take on the truism that ""music is all around us."" For a genre that wants to evoke mysterious, uncharted territories, it's beginning to show signs of predictability, and while Odd Nosdam hews admirable results from it, it's just about time for an increasingly defined border to be pushed outward, into more nebulous territory, again.","Odd Nosdam splits the difference between the eschatological IDM of Boards of Canada and Keith Fullerton Whitman's coruscating dronescapes.

Dreamed,Yellow Swans,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab1d9d034d5c69bf3f78/1:1/w_160/bbf53212.gif,2005-06-02 06:01:20,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8911-dreamed/,Deleted ArtPACrec,"There's nothing extreme about Yellow Swans. Extremists are universally shunned by normal folk; they lurk beyond the outer fringes of society, where no one with a sweet corn niblet of sense dares tread. Extremists don't push boundaries, they pretend to ignore them-- then return to defecate on the masses, spiteful cretins they are. Extremists don't bother releasing records; they're local basement legends, if anything. Extremists don't have brethren who are signed to Sub Pop. Okay, okay-- so Yellow Swans make industrial noise. (I thought I had ya!) But theirs is sonic stench that's totally worth listening to. Think of Dreamed as kind of like Norwegian Christmas Pudding: Finding the almond at its center doesn't promise extra presents from St. Nick, but it will help you attain inner peace. As with most music of its ilk, the trick is finding the Eye of the storm. On Dreamed, Yellow Swans make the task seem easy: It's not the noise, but the rhythm, that dominates. Saddle up and take the 15-minute ""Garrison"" for a ride. Now double back and imagine the song without its insistent, pinioning drum machines and ask yourself if without them you would have made it half as far. Even sans the chicks and clicks, Dreamed is still gentile compared to the shock-and-awe of last year's Bring the Neon War Home. By Swans' standards, Dreamed is like an hour-long Om, so there's some titular propriety. The album, if not exactly lullaby-like, is impressively fluid. A sturdy spine of drone withstands the rigors of furious industrial beats, chopped feedback like metallic dandruff, and, of course, the electro-noise tool of choice, dot matrix printer squalls. The band even treats us to some rare melody. Seething with oversaturated guitar swells and whirls of chirruping noise that can only be described as the sound of all the world's digital information being sucked through a wormhole, ""Drowning in Paradise"" is the most terrestrial thing Yellow Swans have done. It's more Eno than Whitehouse. Some might call it pleasant. Still, noiseniks will be noiseniks. Swans are acrimonious little creatures, and Dreamed doesn't hesitate to chomp a dangling finger or two. Echoey, indecipherable utterances on ""Gold Rush"" and ""Garrison"" add an eerie depth, suggesting that if there's life within these miasmas, inhabitants aren't breathing clean air or sending their kids to the Friends Academy. Venus-hot opener ""Untitled"", this collection's harshest (and, mercifully, shortest) track, tears through sound like old terry cloth using all manners of oscillators and torture devices. Many a soulseeker won't make it through this first, grisly test of will. Dismiss it on ear-protection grounds if you must, but, as an entry point into Yellow Swans' scabrous oeuvre, Dreamed is ideal.","A grisly yet solid introduction to this noise crew's scabrous oeuvre.

Hysterical Stars,Head of Femur,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c14fc0084474cd0c32ff/1:1/w_160/9f5fdbb8.jpg,2005-06-02 06:01:19,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3973-hysterical-stars/,spinART,"There's so much to discuss about Head of Femur's sophomore album, Hysterical Stars, that it's difficult to know where to begin. For starters, the trio employs 27 guest musicians on these 13 tracks, and every song is packed to the gills with sounds and melodies and countermelodies and detours and left-turn movements. It's maximalism in the extreme-- and with barely time to breathe between brass charts, peals of synthesizer, elaborate string parts, and big three-part harmonies, it's easy to get lost in the labyrinthine arrangements. Additionally, the album fits nicely alongside the Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat and Architecture in Helsinki's In Case We Die in a recent string of albums that might best be described as ""hyperprog"": The entire record plays as a long, winding suite, where one crazy idea never has to wait long to meet its match, and songs explode into headlong gallops only to capitulate seconds later into fluttering orchestral passages or odd accordion solos. As with all hyperprog outings, short attention spans are likely to enjoy the album's grab-bag nature, while big-picture people will appreciate the great unified sweep of it all. Head of Femur don't wait long to posit their more-is-more theory, kicking down the door to their technicolor world with ""Elliott Gould Is in California Split"", a song that makes their jam-packed 2003 debut Ringodom or Proctor seem restrained by comparison. Super Furry harmonies and taut basslines weave through a teeming forest of violins, glockenspiels, trumpets, and jittery guitars, spilling into rock passages that sound like a hundred different Beach Boys ringtones going off simultaneously. A track bearing the title of their previous album follows, swooping in with baroque strings, wild horns, XTC-ish guitars, and falsetto oohing and aahing. In fact, it goes through so many different sections, the band could probably have made six songs out of it. But then, that seems to be the point. In the midst of all the marching-band-in-a-penny-arcade madness there are a few songs that step back a (little) bit from the brink of aural overload and show the band for the skilled tunesmiths they are. ""Skirts Are Takin' Over"" is an oceanic ballad anchored by piano and mellotron, limiting horns and other instruments to broad textural strokes. Likewise, ""Easy Street"" is loaded with all manner of instrumentation, focused into one solidly conventional pop song with laser-like efficiency. ""Oh You're Blue"" boasts an amazing string arrangement that segues seamlessly into a rococo orchestral passage. And of course, it splits off into several other directions from there, all of which is better listened to than described. Hysterical Stars closes on its most majestic note with ""Jack and the Water Buffalo"", a song that descends from fairly dry, modest beginnings into a cavernous, reverb-drenched second half, aided by brooding cello and a fantastic piano part. It basically takes five minutes to achieve what most of the songs on the album accomplish in half that time, but in doing so lays bare the incredible amount of craft this album must have taken to assemble. Even the album's greatest failure (the ponderous, nonsensical, and ultimately annoying ""Sausage Canoe"") is intricately and intelligently arranged. There are so many elements to mentally catalog that the first listen is a severe shock to the senses, a musical equivalent of what Dorothy might have felt like when first stepping out of her house into Oz.","Alongside similar outings by the Fiery Furnaces and Architecture in Helsinki, Head of Femur's new LP fits into a string of recent albums that might best be described as ""hyperprog.""

Bang Bang Rock & Roll,Art Brut,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bf5e6ef9596932026d/1:1/w_160/bd0d4946.jpg,2005-06-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/475-bang-bang-rock-roll/,Fierce Panda,"WE'RE JUST TALKING... TO THE KIDS! When you start to measure the amount of music you listen to in gigabytes and jumbo-size Case Logics, it's easy to forget the awesome power of the simple declarative statement. Nothing against all those 30-piece ensembles, nautically focused concept albums, intricate field-recording pastiches, and three-hour drum circles that dominate our musical neighborhood, but sometimes it's refreshing to hear a band maximally juicing a single sentiment down to two-minute concentrate. Meet South London's Art Brut: They're here to fill that vacancy. I'VE SEEN HER NAKED, TWICE! I'VE SEEN HER NAKED, TWICE! That it's difficult for me to find a recent point of reference for Art Brut is a testament to just how self-serious indie rock has become-- although they do share a refreshingly bratty quality with proto-punks like the Buzzcocks and Television Personalities. Frontman Eddie Argos even appears to share Joey Ramone's love for first-person narratives that sound no more complex than a transcript of just-some-guy's thoughts on a completely unremarkable day. Ruminations on ex-girlfriends, new girlfriends, little brothers, modern art, his band, other bands, Italian currency, Los Angeles-- all are expressed in language too shallow for even diary-scrawling, but lifted up to anthemic status through sheer multiple exclamation-point enthusiasm. I CAN'T STAND THE SOUND OF THE... VELVET UNDERGROUND! Oh my God, heresy! But of course, it's only half-serious, a joking reminder to today's bands that VU ended up writing (gasp!) unabashedly fun songs like ""Sweet Jane"" and ""What Goes On"", too. If these sloppy, succinct three-chord bashers fail to tread any ground that isn't already well-worn, they do so in an appealing way that underscores Argos' oscillations between humility and delusions of grandeur. Art Brut might display more versatility than one-tempo Ramones, but not by much, contenting themselves with fast songs (""18,000 Lira"", ""Bad Weekend"") or slow songs (""Rusted Guns of Milan"", ""Stand Down""). It's just enough to give these minutiae-obsessed songs their paradoxical fist-pumping grandeur, and not a bit more. NO MORE SONGS ABOUT SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK N' ROLL... IT'S BOOOOOORING! That this line comes amidst the album's most straight-ahead rock number-- and that about 90% of Argos' lyrics discuss these very topics-- is probably the best joke on the album, though it's not wanting for humorous company. The sly origin story ""Formed a Band"" and art-fetish celebration ""Modern Art"" (both re-recorded here from their 2004 single versions) may have laid the foundation of Art Brut's blog rep, but Bang Bang Rock & Roll's new material is equally hilarious when it aspires to be. Argos paints the perfect picture of musical awakening in ""My Little Brother"", the subject of which expresses his frustration through mixtapes of ""bootlegs and B-sides,"" and makes ""Emily Kane"" more than just a casual remembrance of young love by being able to recollect the last time he saw her, right down to the second. It's tempting to think of Art Brut as the foreign replacement for the catchy/clever observances Weezer used to traffic, the escape fantasy of ""Moving to L.A."" obliterating the clichés of ""Beverly Hills"", with its shirtless motorcycling, hanging with Axl and Morrissey, and foolish tattoos. HAVEN'T READ THE NME IN SO LONG... DON'T KNOW WHAT GENRE WE BELONG! Well, let me try to help. See if you can follow this: Art Brut, through their thoroughly unpretentious embrace of pretentiousness, are the most punk new band I've heard in years, punk having lost itself long ago to the pretentiousness of unpretentiousness. So even though Argos boasts of wanting to ""write the song/ That makes Israel and Palestine get along,"" and planning to perform Art Brut's hit eight weeks in a row on ""Top of the Pops"", any chance you might take him seriously is deflated by the little meta-moments like the one caps-locked above. As with the best LCD Soundsystem singles, Bang Bang Rock & Roll is at times some of the best music criticism going right now, and far better than our boringly verbose bullshit 'cause you can dance to it. AND ART BRUT, WE'VE ONLY JUST STARTED! The optimism of that statement is infectious and hard to argue with, though I'm perfectly aware of the large pile of empty Brit-hype firecrackers that went off with a barely a whimper Stateside. Given their reliance on dry English humour (yes, two u's) and lack of a timely U.S. distribution deal, it's unlikely Art Brut will fare well as well with North American listeners as fellow countrymen Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, and the Futureheads. But then, just a year ago, it seemed unlikely that any of those bands would find fans in the States at all, let alone enough to spark yet another small-scale British invasion-- and all told, it's not hard to imagine their dagger-sharp guitar lines and pop-fueled bash carving its own niche in those other bands' wake if given the opportunity. The only thing to do is start a letter-writing campaign, suffer the import prices, and hope Art Brut's got enough in their tank for another album or two. I can't wait to hear ""Recorded a Sophomore Album!"" ","Building on the success of their highly lauded 2004 singles ""Formed a Band"" and ""Modern Art"", Bang Bang Rock & Roll finds Art Brut obsessing over girlfriends, little brothers, and other rock bands while bashing out three sloppy chords that imbue their minutiae-riffing rants with a paradoxical fist-pumping grandeur.

With their spastic, psychedelic debut garnering them Best New Band tags from the praise-happy NME, and the Strokes, Hives, and White Stripes collectively buttering up America's 60s rock palette, big things seemed to await the Coral in the States. Unfortunately, they were sent back to the UK with their tails between their legs. On their third album the Coral have reverted to a subdued and almost jaded sound-- Invisible Invasion reveals way too many wrinkles and stretch marks for a band barely into their twenties. About the only surviving aspect of their vigorous debut is a laundry list of psychedelic and 60s influences. ""Cripples Crown"" plods along with frontman James Skelly sounding like a disturbingly sober, and bored, Jim Morrison. With its rigid chord progression and reverb-drenched harmonies, ""A Warning to the Curious"" borrows heavily from the more crestfallen Zombies numbers while folk-pop ditty ""Leaving Today"" strives for Byrds-style wholesomeness. Some songs have a pulse of their own, though, such as organ-driven stomper ""The Operator"" and the trippy, mysterious ""She Sings the Mourning"". However, any élan exuded by the openings of these tracks quickly succumbs to Skelly's haggard vocals, which are still stuck on the drowsy Magic & Medicine setting. Even when the band gives him a kick in the pants, like on pounding rocker ""Something Inside of Me"", Skelly's croon is barely beyond speaking level, further proof, sadly, that the Coral's enthusiasm peaked with their excellent 2001 single ""Dreaming of You"". Perhaps this band's saving grace is their immaculate duplication of 60s pop-- the entire album seems predicated on the first minute of ""Light my Fire"". Perhaps if the Coral start aspiring for a 60s sound more intricate than the Austin Powers soundtracks they'll carve their own niche in the mercurial retro scene. Until then, these ancient mariners are being kept afloat by British press hype.","Another set of jaunty, 60s-humping songs from these UK press darlings.

This Station Is Non-Operational,At the Drive In,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12bb1335d7bf16981bd/1:1/w_160/777188be.jpg,2005-06-01 06:01:25,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/330-this-station-is-non-operational/,Fearless,"In seven years, At the Drive-In rose from basements in El Paso, Texas and tours with single-digit attendance to being the stars of the Grand Royal label, solely on the merit of an orgiastic live show and word-of-mouth. Then, just as they began to approach commercial success, they dissolved without a fuss-- not even offering their fans a reason why-- and immediately split into two separate bands that rode the wave of their impact. The point of releasing an At the Drive-In anthology now seems obvious: A convenient and tidy package for lazier consumers would not only benefit them commercially, but could double as a career overview for Mars Volta fans curious about the more modest beginnings of their favorite prog-rock behemoths. This Station Is Non-Operational ignores both routes. Not quite a best-of collection, some of the band's strongest songs (and indeed, even some singles, like ""Invalid Litter Dept."") are ignored by a tracklist that offers a snapshot of the band's artistic growth, from class-act emo to muscular modern rock. That's a kick in the pants if you're looking to drop cash on one comprehensive ATDI release, but anyone with a broadband connection and a computer can create their own hits comp; This Station aims to be a retrospective in the true sense of the word, while also providing enough extras to make it a worthwhile package for longtime fans. Tracks 1-11 provides a tidy time capsule of the band's seven years together; the remaining seven cuts give us a peek at the band's influences and creative growing pains. Culled primarily from singles and split 7-inches, the latter portion of the disc is comprised of two covers, one remix, one live favorite, and three B-sides. The Smiths' ""This Night Has Opened My Eyes"" is a surprising choice for the band, but they play it straight, more or less, with only some added dual-guitar interplay and a touch of distortion. The compilation ends on a light-hearted note with another curious choice, Pink Floyd's ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""-- perhaps an early sign of their itch for more intricate songcraft. As for the four B-sides, there's little worth seeking out, and two of them are particularly unrewarding: ""Incentardis"" thrashes hard but never finds a hook, while ""Doorman's Placebo"" is basically a limp emo track lacking rhythm and energy. The other two are no more engaging-- ""Autorelocator"" is a plodding, directionless electronic experiment, and the Latch Bros. remix of ""Rascuache"" turns the band into a dub-inflected version of Cornershop-- but are mildly compelling curios, as they feel like necessary missteps leading to the subtle electronic touches of the band's later sound. Of course, these tracks weren't included in this package to serve as revelations; they're simply footnotes to the story told by the first 11 tracks. Whether through label differences or the band's own will, At the Drive-In's earliest EPs and first full-length, Acrobatic Tenement, are completely unrepresented here (unless you count the BBC performance of ""Initiation"" tacked onto the end). ""Fahrenheit"" and ""Picket Fence Cartel"" are taken from the El Gran Orgo EP, and pick up on the emo blueprint laid out by a handful of mid-80s Dischord bands (most notably Rites of Spring), but add sharp, unpredictable rhythms and exuberant shout-along hooks, all led by Cedric Bixler's unmistakable Ozzy-esque caterwauls. The four songs taken from the economical In Casino Out continue in the same vein, though the band stretches the formula a bit further. ""Lopsided"" features galloping rhythms and clean guitar that proved the band were equally potent with the distortion dialed down, and ""Pickpocket"" never relents from its streamlined thrashing. ""Chanabra"" adds bongos to one of the disc's most aggressive choruses, hinting at future recordings. And ""Napoleon Solo"" is a whisper/scream tribute to two friends of the band, fellow musicians from their hometown of El Paso, who died in a car accident while ATDI was on tour. ATDI hit their stride on the Vaya EP, and two of its songs are included here. Coming off their previous records, ""Metronome Arthritis"" feels like the work of a different band entirely: Atmospheric guitar scrapes add static to a slow, druggy groove, and meandering guitar lines precede a crunching chorus led by Bixler's true-crime paranoia (""What if forensics finds the answer?/ What if they stole my fingerprints?/ Where did I leave my book of matches?/ We'll find you..."") and a highly melodic guitar lead. ""198d"", on the other hand, stretches the whisper/scream dynamic to its breaking point, squeezing out a final drop of surprise. But after sharpening their skills and working with nu-metal guru Ross Robinson and Andy Wallace, the songs on Relationship of Command are what thrust them into the mainstream. The inclusion of their biggest single, ""One-Armed Scissor"", is a no-brainer. It's almost a summation of everything that made ATDI great: the tick-tock rhythmic interplay and quivering bass of the verses flashed their chops as musicians, and its infamous stop/start chorus riff and shouted ""cut ah-way!"" hook that could still slice through the airwaves today. It took the cock out of cock-rock but retained the molar-grinding testosterone, while finding room for emo histrionics, a psychedelic detour, and a great punk rock scream from the whole band. ""Non-Zero Possibility"" puts mood over matter, and though it's a successful diversion with diverse instrumentation, I'd take nearly any track on Relationship of Command over it. Perhaps it's an apt finale, being the closing track on their final album. ""Enfilade"" is more like it, merging the band's disparate influences perfectly: The ominous Cure-inspired rock and snapping drum machines of the verses (not unlike the opening of ""Arc Arsenal"") with more of Bixler's cloak-and-dagger lyrics, and a bongo-driven detour that shows off drummer Tony Hijada's diversity and nods to the group's Latin influences-- a calm-before-the-storm just before a perfect fist-pumping, shout-along chorus. While the performances on Relationship of Command were overwhelmingly reckless, At the Drive-In's go-for-broke attitude cut both ways: Guitarist Jim Ward was quoted as saying, ""As soon as one of us gets tired of doing this, if it's in the middle of [an] interview or in the middle of a tour, that's it. We're done."" And on the verge of conquering radio and selling nearly a million copies of that record, they kept their promise. ""Relentless"" wasn't even the word for their touring schedule since forming in 1994-- their work ethic was certifiably insane, as they didn't even take a day off for the tragedy interpreted in ""Napoleon Solo"", and cancelled only two dates after their own van accident in 2000. The lyrics of ""One-Armed Scissor"" paraphrase the isolation of the band's first few tours together while foreshadowing their end-- even one of its ominous lyrics make for this compilation's title. The lyrics on Relationship of Command might be oblique, but a message isn't hard to discern; after a non-stop seven-year tour/record/tour schedule, each song seems like a desperate S.O.S. Now that the dust has settled, the fans have moved on, and its members have recast themselves in their new bands, the press has readily accepted At the Drive-In offshoots Sparta as being ""accessible"" and The Mars Volta ""difficult"", but the push/pull between the two extremes within the songs on This Station Is Non-Operational is seamless. This anthology begs the question: Why should rock fans have to settle for one or the other?","18-song anthology traces the band's shift from class-act emo to muscular modern rock.

Everything Ecstatic,Four Tet,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0bea9e61561daa7831/1:1/w_160/c207ee0e.jpg,2005-06-01 06:01:23,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3168-everything-ecstatic/,Domino,"Kieran Hebden will not be your cuddly electro-organic playdate. He will not acknowledge the term ""folktronica"" in casual conversation. And he will most certainly not prattle on about Bruce Springsteen using his song ""Slow Jam"" (humorously mislabeled as ""Slow Burn"" on the Boss' official site) as walk-out music for the Devils & Dust Tour. After the minor success of his third solo full-length, 2003's Rounds, it seems like a good old-fashioned bout of rebellion is in order. With *Rounds, Hebden created a blissful blend of his small-time, insular sound-swirls and bold-face beats. Accordingly, Radiohead, Beth Orton, and Super Furry Animals commissioned remixes, and even some non-nerds started to pay attention. But apparently Hebden isn't totally comfortable with his music filling the ""chill"" role at a progressive frat house's latest hackey-sack soiree. * Everything Ecstatic sees the sunken-eyed Brit forgoing the lullaby instrumentation and straightforward rhythms of its predecessor for a darker, more intricate sound-- one rooted more in chaotic free jazz than skewed folk. While this stylistic move is admirable, though, it sometimes sacrifices Hebden's more accessible melodic gifts in its quest for fresh ideas. Whereas the amplified thump of a human heart gave Rounds an instant corporeal quality, Ecstatic opens on the back of a harsh, scraping bass loop. The low growl remains constant throughout ""A Joy"" as an army of programmed snares nimbly cross over each other before the organized noise dissolves into a computerized Jim O'Rourke-style cacophony of screeching bells, other-worldly whistles, and an overarching sense of many computers crashing at the exact same time. The tattered beginning is an adequate primer to Ecstatic's scruffier palette. The slow-building ""Sun Drums and Soil"" is the album's strongest example of Hebden's Ornette-Coleman-meets-Sun-Ra direction. Near tribal drums build an underworld base for the song to snake out from. Keyboard lines wrap around each other as radio static muddies the mid-song breakdown. What sound like distant, effected vocals conjure another set of crushing drums and, eventually, a wonderfully wailing saxophone bleats, furthering the fury. Haunting, challenging and ultimately rewarding, the raucous track sees Hebden letting his freakout-flag fly, but not everything on Ecstatic is so dense. The languid ""And Then Patters"" harkens back to Rounds' lush simplicity, while the jubilant ""Smile Around the Face"" may be the closest Hebden's ever come to an in-the-flesh pop song. The rinky-dink hi-hats keep it playful as Hebden puts his phaser effect to use, employing washes of synths that cut in and out across the speakers. But the track's unique, irresistible calling card is a sped-up vocal sample lifted straight out of Kanye West's Louis Vuitton backpack. The happy-chipmunk loop sticks and Hebden justly milks it, adorning the track with a multitude of additional sonic drips and fluffy atmospherics. Undeniably catchy and unabashedly cheerful, ""Smile Around the Face"" attests to Hebden's appealingly child-like anything-goes quality. On the flipside of that fresh-breeze highlight is ""Turtle Turtle Up"", a two-minute jumble of vintage video game blips and pummeling drums that comes off as an in-process demo. The lackluster tune is followed-up by the BPM-bumping dancefloor clear-out ""Sleep, Eat Food, Have Visions"", near the end of the album. The eight-minute epic sees Hebden recreating the beat-busting portion of his live show where he gradually turns the speed knob all the way up until just a sheet of sound remains, which he toys with accordingly. The trick works in concert thanks to his improvisational tact and resourcefulness, but when nailed down on record, the technique becomes laborious. Taking into account his recent impressive Madvillain remixes and the forthcoming album he's producing for Beth Orton, it seems like Hebden may be using his Four Tet albums to further his stylistic reach so he can apply his sound to more typically song-based collaborations. And more power to him. Everything Ecstatic marks his first slight step backward as a solo artist but it's hardly a failure. Like a natural jazz improviser flailing about in search of the precise moment to let loose a flurry of inspired notes, Hebden consistently sticks his neck out every which way here, knowing full well it may be chopped off at any moment.","On his latest album, Kieran Hebden forgoes the lullaby instrumentation and straightforward rhythms of its predecessor, Rounds, for a darker, more intricate sound-- one rooted more in chaotic free jazz than skewed folk.

Paid in Full / Follow the Leader,Eric B. & Rakim,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9aabf31b7dc7155d69/1:1/w_160/a7b99eb1.png,2005-06-01 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11734-paid-in-full-follow-the-leader/,IslandIsland,"For a second, forget everything extraneous about Eric B. & Rakim: Rakim’s G.O.A.T. status; the debate over who was actually responsible for their music; the rumor that Eric had to get a steel rod in his spine after the dookie ropes fucked his neck up. After a dozen changes of rap fashion, when kids born in 1987 are graduating from high school, do these records still hold up? Do they deserve your money when more new music than ever crowds the shelves? Well, yes. Obviously. Especially since these new masters are retailing for a beyond-fair 10 bucks. (Whatever the quality of the material, charging nearly $20 for catalog items is robbery.) Unlike the bulked-up, slightly lardy Paid in Full reissue from 1999, this edition tacks on a few bonuses without making a big deal out of it. (Full disclosure: I am an original-sequencing purist.) And of course, the music is as essential as the James Brown whose skinny legs supported large chunks of their legacy. It’s hard to believe, now that the Neptunes have made zen thrift signify in the nouveau-riche top 10, but these minimal and sometimes unfriendly (though never less than seductive and often galvanic) tracks represented an anti-pop move. You have to rewind back to the mid-80s—not a super time for “urban” music outside of a nascent rap scene still underground enough to need label addresses at the end of singles reviews. Luther Vandross. Anita Baker. Lionel Richie outselling all other black artists of 1984. Is it any wonder in this context that booming kickdrums, garden claw snares, bacteria-disrupting sub-bass, and tales (freaky, funny, raw, and true) seemed the only viable alternative? Eric Barrier and William Griffin benefited by being in the right place (NYC) at the right time (just as rap began fumbling towards its own sense of importance). Their mentor, Marley Marl, had just begun to work with the digital sampler, a tentative step away from the fixed parameters of both drum machines and house bands, and towards open-ended creative theft. Marl, Schoolly D, Scott La Rock and others had defined mid-80s rap as a crash of stiff, hard, stupid (in the best sense) Linn drums and astounding B.S. rhymes. If it was hip-hop’s garage-rock—a street reaction against the first wave of crossover pop-rap—then it was all but waiting for the kind of intellectual vernacular so beloved of critics to “take it to the next level.” Griffin threw his Kangol in the ring from the opening lines of Eric B & Rakim's debut single, “Eric B Is President”: “I came in the door/I said it before/I never let the mic magnetize me no more.” It is one of the 10 or so most famous verses in rap. Rakim’s innovation was applying a patina of intellectual detachment to rap’s most sacred cause: talking shit about how you’re a better rapper than everyone else. He was the supreme exponent of rapping-about-rapping, an almost lost art now that every MC carries a thousand pounds of crack-dealing backstory around with him. Rakim immediately projected his self-belief—not so much messianic as matter-of-fact—that he was the best. He got away with it every time he opened his mouth and that voice came out: authoritative, burnished, possessing an unflappable sense of rhythm like a drumming prodigy. You only think of his restricted subject matter as a failing in the wake of Big, Pac, Cube, even Chuck D. You don’t go to Rakim for political insight, inner turmoil, or sex chat. You go to Rakim for an endless display of pure skill. He encourages the grading mindset. The big reason why Nas is runner-up is because he injected some pathos and fallibility into the preternatural control thing. Skills, of course, can be their own reward, when put into the service of exciting people rather than showing off. (Okay, or a mix of the two.) And when the records are playing, it’s hard to begrudge them their 30-yard stare. Paid in Full, the debut, is more laidback and funky, though padded at seven vocals and three instrumentals. It reprised the debut single, a moody, atypical fusion full of stark dub-like dropouts, mod stutter effects, and flat production. It’s obvious why they stuck it at the end of the album; at that point, rap was moving so fast that records released six months prior were already old hat. The second single, “My Melody,” is pre-“funky” hip-hop par excellence and a 2005 hit in waiting, with little more than a concrete cracking kickdrum and a blunt-edged bassthrob. (Of course, R’s flow would immediately mark him out as an old man amongst today’s shouters, growlers, and mumblers.) “I Know You Got Soul” let some human grit into the man-machine via JB, and momentarily fucked up everyone’s concept of the space-time continuum until cyborgizing old drummers became common enough to show up in Milli Vanilli records. “Paid in Full” was kind of light and fun, even if its subject matter was dead serious. Getting paid for studio work? Not the corner? Not the grind? The future was wide open. Both of these albums contain too much filler to get a free “classic” pass, but the highs of Follow the Leader are as high as any rap group has gotten. The title track fleshes out Rakim’s metaphorical conceit via hellish high-speed-chase music. The beats rattle, the bass seethes, the flutes and strings screech like Blaxploitation crossed with the cheap urgency of an Italian zombie movie. But what’s scariest and most exhilarating is how, for all the track’s runaway train momentum, it feels inexorable, implacable, utterly in control of itself. Rakim’s delivery of the final verse may be the most exciting—at least in terms of breath control—slice of rap the genre has yet delivered. (And no, Twista doesn’t count.) “Microphone Fiend” rattled sleigh bells harder than anyone until Pete Rock showed up, and the stabbing dynamics of the guitar sample harassed the ear something awful. The chopper blade beats of “Lyrics of Fury” almost render the genre it would help to inspire (jungle) redundant. In this era, when almost all rap was “fast rap,” tracks like these and “The R” were the roughneck alternative to a burgeoning hip-house, beats impacting your body as your mind swam at the density of words. Unfortunately, by the time they released Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em, an attempt to extend the deft simplicity of their debut, in 1990, they were already old news. (Perhaps best exemplified by the cover of 1992’s Don’t Sweat the Technique.) Deposed kings before they'd even hit their 30s, they’ve limped through the ensuing decade about which the most that can be said is that they didn’t scuff up their legacy too much. These reissues add a handful of remixes (two on Paid, three on Leader), none essential. The only criminal inclusion is a truncated version of Coldcut’s remix of “Paid in Full” rather than the full seven minutes of madness. (But whatever, it’s overrated anyway.) The covers—with their gold anchor chains, manhole medallions, and customized Dapper Dan jackets—are a nice rebuke to anyone who thinks conspicuous consumption is a new-school disease. The contents are a reminder of a brief period where people thought they could become a millionaire on skills alone, where the reality of that was so far away that no one had to think about what being a millionaire would mean to the culture that nurtured those skills.",,7.8,
11:11,Maria Taylor,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a22fea9e61561daa499b/1:1/w_160/851044b1.jpg,2005-06-01 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8290-1111/,Saddle Creek,"Conor Oberst's Saddle Creek label has become a Neverland of sorts, a conduit for precocious 90s teen-rockers like himself to produce albums that echo the desperation and despair of a 16-year-old. Maybe I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning was supposed to be Oberst's (and possibly Saddle Creek's) transition from bumpkin adolescent malcontent to world-weary traveler, but there's too much Holden Caulfield pathos permeating the album to signify a major persona reconstruction. Likewise, Maria Taylor's been spewing out WB-style melodrama with Saddle Creek darlings Azure Ray and Now It's Overhead for the last half decade, creating somber, gooey music fit for the closing credits of any ""Gilmore Girls"" episode. 11:11, however, hardly pretends to be Taylor's heady, ""grown-up"" solo album, but rather an expanded cross-section of her Azure Ray and Now It's Overheard contributions. Taylor's strengths and weaknesses are completely exposed on the album, most notably her tendency to focus on melody and allow the instrumentation to mire in the background. Opener ""Leap Year"" demonstrates this imbalance perfectly. Convoluted strings, synthesizers, and piano lethargically float over a limp electronic percussion foundation. Meanwhile, Taylor drenches each of her breathily sung lyrics with dewy-eyed melancholy, allowing the vocals to steer the track rather than the nearly homogenous chord progression. After Taylor wistfully gasps the song's final lyrics ""PleaseÉcomeÉsoon"", the song's emotional force stalls over a 45-second instrumental outro. Fortunately, Taylor's tentative electronica dabbling only affects ""Leap Year"" and the lead-footed ""dance"" track ""One for the Shareholder,"" which blatantly ignores the perils of Oberst's mediocre Digital Ash in a Digital Urn. ""Nature Song"" and ""Birmingham 1982,"" on the other hand, showcase Taylor sticking with what she knows-- organic Southern-flavored folk pop. Sure, Taylor's just reinventing the wheel with these tracks, but nowhere else on the album does such synergy exist between her swollen melodies and humble acoustic. Of course, not even these moments can conceal the one degree of separation between Saddle Creek and ""Dawson's Creek"". ""Song Beneath the Song"" takes cues from B-level James Van Der Beek dialogue, repeating ""it's not a love song"" over a monotonous, textbook I-IV-V chord progression. With its innocuous piano and hooks rounded off into drawn-out cooing, ""Hitched"" is a Cat Power song lined with Styrofoam-- just too damn safe. On select tracks, Taylor may show boldness and an independency from Azure Ray and Now It's Overhead, but ultimately 11:11 settles for pandering to the backpack-toting, drama-thirsty WB demographic that has dovetailed so immaculately with the Saddle Creek universe.","Azure Ray vocalist provides Saddle Creek with more WB-style melodrama.

We Can Breathe Under Alcohol,An Angle,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1be13d19756521386dd/1:1/w_160/ef8416f6.jpg,2005-05-31 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/474-we-can-breathe-under-alcohol/,Drive-Thru,"Kris Anaya is the young songwriter behind An Angle. He's been writing songs since the age of 17 and likely drinking for longer than that. We Can Breathe Under Alcohol is the group's second album, and from just looking at the title and tracklist, alcohol is a recurring theme. While countless songwriters have drawn inspiration from the bottle, Anaya shies away from romanticizing a bad habit-- but nor does he reveal any telling anecdotes, epiphanies, or underlying morals. We just know he drinks. Like, a lot. The lyrics move from the cheap camaraderie of friends sitting at a bar (""Green Water"") to reaching a David Brent-level of awkward confrontation (""Angry Drunk"", which repeats ""My parents think my drinking is becoming an issue"" ad nauseam) that reveal nothing about Anaya or the ""characters"" he's writing about. Arrangements are this record's saving grace. Compare the sparse acoustics of ""Whales Talk Whales Walk"" or ""St. Augustine"" to the horn section on ""Change the World"", the strings on ""Angry Drunk"", or the dash of piano near the end of ""Green Water"" (in a pretty direct nod to Elliot Smith's ""Son of Sam""). They may not be daring additions, but they're nice aesthetic touches that show off the band's musicianship. They also take some of the focus from Anaya's vocals, reminiscent of another young prodigy whose name begins with a ""C"" and ends in ""onor Oberst."" But given the diversity of sounds on We Can Breathe..., it's a tolerable affectation, providing Anaya isn't stretching the word ""light"" into five syllables just to fit the rhyme scheme (""White Horse""). There's one more mantra on this record that gets almost as much lyrical attention as alcohol, which is: ""Fuck the indie music scene."" The ""scene"" is taken to task not just once, but on four different songs. Is that supposed to be provocative? Defiant? Maybe I'm taking the bait here, but might they be shooting themselves in the foot just a bit, considering We Can Breathe... sounds like a senior thesis in the Bright Eyes School of Vocal Delivery? More importantly, is the ""indie scene"" important enough to be juxtaposed against television, the NRA, the Capitol building, and the Iraq War in the lyrics to a supposed protest song (""Change the world"")? Yes, indie rock must be stopped at all costs-- It's the wrong scene at the wrong time! No Blood for White Guys with Guitars! More than just over-earnestness and a whiff of hypocrisy, it's narrow perspective than sinks an otherwise adequate indie rock record. What lingers with me the most is the final moments of the acoustic closing track ""St. Augustine"": When Anaya arrives at the final chorus, he calls to his background singers, ""We need some help...so let's sing for peace!"" After which, his monotone ""la-la-la's"" can barely be heard above the crowd. If Anaya can't be bothered to raise his voice, how can anyone be expected to sing along?","Clueless kid embarrassingly rips off Bright Eyes, even in his press photos. Shameless.

Seal Beach EP,The Album Leaf,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a041b1335d7bf1697f9e/1:1/w_160/b5ad0fd9.jpg,2005-05-31 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/102-seal-beach-ep/,Better Looking,"Seal Beach EP is an exercise in restful, reverent mood music, as measured and deliberate as a high-flying gull stroking through a cloudless sky. There are plenty of indie rockers thumbing spectral ambiance from their keyboards, but no one is doing it with the same level of restraint and precision as Jimmy LaValle. Nevertheless, the field is over-saturated, and it's a given that this record will strike impatient listeners as tedious. LaValle is working from a familiar palette here-- each song finds layers of wavering drone shot through with sparse yet complexly ramifying mechanical drums, long arcs of simple, chiming leads and trembling strings wafting over resonant slabs of melodic bass. Point blank, if you're not in the right headspace for this stuff, it's going to bore no matter how well done. But if you are, LaValle's spare, translucent brushstrokes seem like an elemental and ideal expression of the form. Originally released in Spain, on Acuarela Records, in 2003, this Stateside reissue is fleshed out with new violin parts, a rare track (""For Jonathan""), and five previously unreleased live tracks with Sigur Rós sitting in, making for a whopping 10-track EP. And since the only real difference between LaValle's live and studio recordings is that the live ones have applause at the end, his elegant sonic calculus has a seamless placidity and cinematic gravity that allows for complete immersion. The ease of immersion makes the Seal Beach EP such a lulling siren song, and this is credit to LaValle's self-control. Indie electronica has developed a familiar dynamic-- start in tranquility, then ratchet up the drums and synths in crisp shifts of intensity until the track is galloping and hiccupping like a drunken mechanical bull. LaVelle doesn't succumb to the bombastic urge, and his ephemeral webs stretch out with a serene, meditative profundity unbroken by the non-linear impulse. Nor does he feel the need to tack superfluous noises onto his pale watercolor washes, having the confidence to let the bare essentials of song stand alone, ebbing and flowing as naturally as the tide. From the flaring static, whirring drums and contrapuntal clicktrack of ""Malmo"", to the gently wailing violins and pirouetting synths of ""Brennivin"", to the briskly accruing acoustic guitar arpeggios of ""One Minute"", Seal Beach EP comprises a summer jam for the North Pole, and the Album Leaf continues to set the pace for those who would politely drone.","On the heels of his Sub Pop debut, Jimmy LaValle's latest outing finds him mastering restraint and precision.

Playing quintessential power-pop while signed to grunge-oriented major Geffen didn't help. At any rate, Sloan's lack of U.S. commercial success in the 1990s represents the nadir of U.S.-Canuck relations between ""54 40 or Fight!"" and that government official calling Dubya a ""moron"" in 2002-- yeah, I'm including ""Informer"". A Sides Win captures most of the high points along this Halifax, Nova Scotia-based quartet's career arc and adds two adequate new songs, all in the blessedly sensible chronological order too many singles comps eschew. Representing 1993 debut Smeared, the ambitiously geeky ""Underwhelmed"" and dreamy ""500 Up"" open the record, distending the band's typical hook-filled melodies with swirling guitars that hint at both Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. 1994 follow-up Twice Removed yields the concentrated melodic O.J. of ""Coax Me""-- ""it's not the band I hate, it's their fans!""-- and dull post-shoegaze ""People of the Sky"". This is where Sloan began to carve out their niche as a power-pop band, and also where their chances for American stardom were squandered amid Geffen's lack of marketing support. Sloan's crowning achievement remains 1996's gloriously catchy One Chord to Another, which fulfilled its predecessor's promise with punchy tunes indebted to Graham Nash-era Hollies and, of course, that Fabbest of Fours. Unsurprisingly, tracks from that album are A Sides Win's peak. ""The Lines You Amend"" jangles like ""The Ballad of John & Yoko"" while name-dropping Ringo. ""Everything You've Done Wrong"" skips along to handclaps and trumpets far sunnier than its title. ""The Good in Everyone"" concisely summarizes Sloan's style, anchoring sunny British Invasion harmonies in crunchy power chords. While most of the tracks taken from Sloan's subsequent four studio albums reflect the band's descent into clunky riff-rock that owes as much to AC/DC and KISS as to power-pop icons like Big Star or Zumpano, Pretty Together's ""The Other Man"" is a glistening alt-rocker supposedly inspired by bassist Chris Murphy's inserting himself (ahem) between Broken Social Scene's Andrew Whiteman and Canadian songstress Feist. O indie Canada! Sloan are a better singles band than an albums band, so A Sides Win all but atones for their sometimes underwhelming (ha!) latter-day failings. Even 2003's Action Pact sounds brilliant when its sole inclusion is jaunty, contemplative ""The Rest of My Life"". The two new songs don't exactly hint at a renaissance, but at least they show a band still rummaging for new classic rock inspiration-- the Cars-like palm-muting and synths of ""Try to Make It"", the can't-drive-just-55 riff-churner ""All Used Up"". All that said, listeners just discovering Sloan would still be better off buying One Chord to Another.","Halifax power-pop band compiles all its singles from 1992 to 2005.

Don't Believe the Truth,Oasis,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab679d034d5c69bf4005/1:1/w_160/4ef19381.jpg,2005-05-31 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8982-dont-believe-the-truth/,Epic,"Oasis were once the biggest rock group on the planet, shattering sales records and selling out stadia, their every embarrassing interpersonal dust-up chronicled in scathing detail by British tabloids. But while they may have been the biggest, they were far from the best. Hell, Oasis weren't even the best Britpop band. It's as though they succeeded solely by their own notorious conviction that they were the Beatles' rightful successors. But all things end, and as the bloated Be Here Now hit stores in 1997 at the height of their popularity, they settled in for the backlash, which, eight years later, is still in full force. Or close to it, anyway-- I've read several write-ups of their latest album, Don't Believe the Truth, that struggle to explain why it's a return to form from their last two miscarriages, Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and Heathen Chemistry. Unfortunately, these reviews are either based on wishful thinking or plain bad taste. If anything, Don't Believe the Truth is the chilling conclusion to their discography's trilogy of shame. It's difficult to define what a return to form would be for Oasis. In hindsight, Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory aren't much more than competent albums that managed to score a handful of genuinely triumphant, anthemic singles-- and Don't Believe the Truth certainly falls well short of the high-water mark those records set for the band. A decidedly scattershot affair, the new record only exceeds the sum of its parts for a few fleeting moments. There are a lot of reasons this album doesn't gel, not least that Liam Gallagher now sounds like a singing anti-smoking campaign, and the brash, snotty arrogance that once sold ""Cigarettes and Alcohol"" and ""Champagne Supernova"" is crushed out by his gruffness. When brother Noel sings (which he often does), he's so obviously dispassionate about the project that he seems to disappear completely. Worse still, the band's non-Gallaghers are content to act as tired session musicians, even when they're writing the songs. Gem Archer wrote one and Andy Bell contributed two, but you'd never know without the liners, as they're totally indistinguishable from Noel's uninspired castoffs. Weirdly, the track that seems least like a Noel tune is actually one he wrote: ""Part of the Queue"" sounds like something off Doves' Lost Souls, if not quite up to that band's standards. ""Mucky Fingers"" is also a relative departure for the band, sounding roughly like the Velvet Underground's ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" stripped of all personality and topicality. Not that topicality has ever been an Oasis strength. They've always leaned on ambiguity and the easy rhyme in their lyrics (I suppose in the reach for universality), and there's no indication that's going to change. Check Liam's ""Love Like a Bomb"", where he does his best John Lennon while sneering the decidedly un-Lennonesque lines, ""You turn me on/ Your love's like a bomb/ Blowin' my mind."" Thankfully, they've tossed in a couple of worthwhile tracks to salvage the record from the junkheap, chief among them ""The Importance of Being Idle"", which, though never quite as promising as its title suggests, has a pleasant music hall bounce to it and one of Noel's better vocals. Liam's ""Guess God Thinks I'm Abel"", meanwhile, offers a rare instance of Oasis handing us a melody rather than slamming us over the head with it-- and it even shockingly refrains from capitalizing on the title's obvious pun, a huge plus. Sadly, strong melodies are in short supply elsewhere on Don't Believe the Truth, and what little they've drudged up are largely sunk by utilitarian arrangements. Incidentally, you may have heard that Ringo Starr's kid, Zak Starkey, has become a member of Oasis for this record. It's a great publicity stunt for the band, and it's even partly true-- Starkey contributed his drumwork to a couple of these tracks (the rest are hammered out by faceless session dudes). The presence of Beatle offspring at the kid, however, only heightens the surrealism of Oasis' idol worship, and does nothing for them musically. So I suppose, in the end, the best that can be said of Don't Believe the Truth is that it is a slight improvement over their previous two studio efforts, and that they at least had the sense to scrap the recordings they made with Death in Vegas and return to a simpler, more traditional sound. But regrettably, their adherence to what they do best only helps so much: When I found out that Oasis had a new album on the way, my reaction was ""they're still together?"" I still can hardly believe it, and given their disinterested performances here, it would seem neither can they.","More than a decade after their debut LP-- and about eight years after anyone outside of the UK stopped caring about them-- the Gallagher Brothers churn out another set of arena-ready, 1960s-biting rock.

Be,Common,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a0c0084474cd0bfc08/1:1/w_160/ddbb9dc6.jpg,2005-05-31 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1566-be/,Geffen,"Notice Lonnie Lynn's expression on the cover of his new record. It's not a smirk or a simper or even a smile-- it's a full-on grin. Bathed in a golden hue, the image is an instant-vintage snapshot of the sincerity and canny idealism that has marked Common's 13-year hip-hop career. As other MCs fall by the conscious curbside due to nascent acting careers (Mos Def, Andre 3000) or misguided mainstream pleas (Talib Kweli, the Roots), this Chicago native rebounds from 2002's botched hip-hop-flower-child experiment Electric Circus with the help of fellow Windy City native Kanye West on Be, which comfortably ranks alongside Resurrection and Like Water for Chocolate as Common's best work to date. The album introduces itself with a few somber, contemplative notes from an upright bass. Then the heavy strings awake from their slumber and start popping. A slurring analog keyboard line slides in. Juke joint piano begins to roll. ""Yes,"" Common says with a resounding confidence that instantly placates any holdover Electric Circus worries. Elevated by the melodic burst of the quintessential West beat, Common proceeds to dole out his State of Urban America Address: ""Bush pushin' lies/ Killers immortalized/ We got arms but won't reach for the skies."" With no hook and a cold Chi-town setting where ""drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones,"" Be's intro is inviting, stern, buoyant, and level-headed all at once, establishing a theme of restrained optimism. It's deftly followed by the crack-a-lack street symphony ""The Corner"". ""We write songs about wrong because it's hard to see right,"" Common intones, alongside his legendary heroes the Last Poets. Guided by the tenants of his classic hip-hop parable ""I Used to Love H.E.R."", the wise MC is not preaching, just leisurely speaking, playing the world-weary yet still-hopeful ghetto documentarian. Still gazing into his daughter's eyes for inspiration as he did on Like Water for Chocolate's ""The 6th Sense"", Common, at the near-ancient hip-hop age of 33, refreshingly looks to generations both past and future for the answers to the big questions he's searching for on Be. Nowadays, Common won't leave you slack-jawed at his meta-metaphor verbal gymnastics. His flow is slowed and smoothed out, with understated emphasis and emotion taking the place of young-buck flashiness. The lack of instant-gratification couplets may disappoint at first, but each verse's rewarding intricacies become more evident with multiple listens. Sonically, Be is utterly listenable: With just 11 songs in 42 minutes (including Pop's rap), the record is as succinct as its title. Be's brevity is not only welcomed but almost iconoclastic. Making the album speed by even faster is the intrinsic sense of continuity provided by West and the like-minded J Dilla. The famed dropout's nine tracks feature his signature sound with slight unconventional arrangement twists and scratch-down turns that prevent dull uniformity: Instead of a third verse on the two-sided adulterous saga ""Faithful"", the song segues into a celestial duet with John Legend tethered to the hook while wily eccentric Bilal soars above with his melismatic vocal theatrics. Once a pupil of Chicago producer No I.D., who helped construct Common's early boom-bap sound, West does his mentor proud on Be, exuberantly pushing his one-time lyrical foe to unleash superior oratory skills while cutting-and-pasting archaic soul samples from forgotten artists such as gospel-tinged loverman DJ Rogers (""Faithful"") and familial funk group Cornelius Brothers & Sister Rose (""Chi City""). Aside from the horn-laden ""Real People"", which nicks 70s organist Caesar Frazier's ""Sweet Children"" wholesale, West once again proves himself to be an inventive, natural talent behind the boards, as on ""The Food,"" which flips the opening notes of Sam Cooke's ""Nothing Can Change This Love"" for its infectious piano loop. There are no skippable songs on Be, but one decision disrupts the album's admirably consistent 68-degrees-in-the-shade vibe: The inclusion of the ""Chappelle's Show"" version of ""The Food"". Though the live take has an intensity missing on the studio version (released on vinyl last year), the Chappelle introduction and opening and closing applause pull the listener out of Be's palpable Southside surroundings. The album would have been better served by a redone studio take on the tune, which had the potential to be one of Be's finest. Picayune flaws aside, the album's appeal stems from Common's passionate honesty. This invigorating trait means ballads like ""Love Is..."" and ""It's Your World"" don't melt into mush. The former sees him talking tender over a sinuous J Dilla beat that layers airy Marvin Gaye vocal samples atop each other to sublime effect. ""Some say that I'm a dreamer because I talk about it often/ Seen the hardest nigga soften with his homey in a coffin,"" he says, admitting his romantic weaknesses while concurrently highlighting the inevitable downsides of such boundless affections. The latter features an unflinching, detailed narrative chronicling a downtrodden Midwestern prostitute's sympathetic plight: ""I remember in high school, she had a passion to sing/ Now she see herself in her casket in dreams."" The woman's tale can be seen as a dreadful sequel to hip-hop's own plight in ""I Used to Love H.E.R."" More than a decade after that distillation of the pitfalls of the culture, hip-hop continues to relish in the violent and abusive tropes at an increasingly overt level. Still, Common lends power and self-worth to the character in ""It's Your World"", hoping she can use it to her advantage-- but also realizing her fate may be sealed. ""She still wanna see California,"" he concludes. Whether she ever makes it is left lovingly, realistically unanswered. ","Refreshed and refocused after a three-year absence, Chicago hip-hop icon Common rebounds from 2002's disasterous psych- hop odyssey Electric Circus: Easily ranking with Resurrection and Like Water for Chocolate, Be stands among his best work to date.

Futures,Dead Machines,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14f5e6ef95969320165/1:1/w_160/f58925c3.jpg,2005-05-31 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2612-futures/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Comprised of the husband-and-wife duo of Wolf Eyes' John Olson and Tovah O'Rourke, who has released music with Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice among others, Dead Machines specialize in their own unique brand of disintegrated electronic noise. Futures, the latest fruit of their union, is their first recording to see any kind of widespread CD release, although it'd be incorrect to consider it a true debut. Both partners operate their own micro-labels-- Olson with his American Tapes imprint and O'Rourke co-manages Polyamory-- and have previously released umpteen Dead Machines works in tiny editions in virtually every format imaginable, as well as a 2004 full-length LP on Ecstatic Peace. Even so, this album has the feel of a comprehensive introduction, as its five extended, untitled tracks completely immerse the listener in the duo's seemingly unmapped wasteland of manipulated feedback, hissing static, and hot-wired electronics. It's an intense, uncompromising exhibition; one that's sure to tantalize veteran noise hedonists (who can certainly feel free to mentally adjust the above rating upwards a couple clicks) but is unlikely to recruit many new converts to the cause. Departing somewhat from the punk-bred approach of Wolf Eyes and their unkempt Midwestern kin, Dead Machines here generally forgo the metal-inflected, doom-laden shriek of acts like Merzbow or Kevin Drumm in favor of cleaner, more diffuse abstractions whose ambient, eerily detached pulsations are at times reminiscent of such electronic minimalists as Kazunao Nagata and others from Japan's Zero Gravity label. If Wolf Eyes can occasionally sound like an squad of robots armed with band-saws descending upon a crowded cattleyard, Dead Machines instead favor the sound of those same robots lying prone in a state of decay, their batteries corroded, their circuit boards shorted and crackling. On first pass, the album's progression sounds almost arbitrary, as each track cycles through a virtually untraceable series of sputtering audio waves and tortured mechanical clatter in a manner that suggests little intervention by its human operators. Upon repeat listens, however, patterns begin to emerge reluctantly from the squall, and though it's probably inaccurate to suggest that Futures contains much in the way of an organized structure, the album does reveal the duo's recognizable fingerprints as they intuitively shape the music's unstable, textured contours. This sense of distinctive individual authorship is crucial to the album's appeal, as without it the duo's sound risks becoming overwhelmingly sterile and faceless. If there's a central dissonance at the core of the Dead Machines experience it stems from their creation of these carefully hand-crafted audio artifacts that too often sound as though they could've been created by anyone in possession of the same busted equipment, or even independently of human musicians altogether. And I suspect it's this conflict that will, for too many listeners, make Futures feel like more of an impenetrable wall than a doorway.","Wolf Eyes' John Olson and wife Tovah O'Rourke collaborate on this, their first-ever CD release.

American Automatic,Kill Memory Crash,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4aabf31b7dc7155ca3/1:1/w_160/4b8aa9ee.jpg,2005-05-30 06:01:37,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4599-american-automatic/,Ghostly,"Feted label Ghostly International declared that this album has Kill Memory Crash ""ushering in a new era of industrial music with a calculated assault on the post-Warp electronic scene."" Superb, a call to arms for the factory unions to overthrow the petty, bourgeois pencilnecks who stare at their laptops during concert to emit neutered, pasteurized, and deracinated versions of glories past from the Warp Records Internationale of Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, and Plaid. What is the manifesto, my comrade? Simple: Pretend that the last 15-odd years of industrial dance music didn't happen and concoct music accordingly-- that is dance like it is 1990. True, the ""post-Warp"" zeitgeist could use a smack upside the head as it is still locked into the point where faster and more convoluted rhythms and harmonics are demanded. But I doubt that Kill Memory Crash's second release on a label that is sometimes guilty of being ""post-Warp"" will stamp an impact, as they play fairly generic, club-filler Electronic Body Music (EBM)-- the descendent of Skinny Puppy, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb, translating industrial's mechanical rhythms and metal guitar grind into disco for sulking, malnourished vampires Kill Memory Crash are vets from Chicago's industrial/EBM underground who've sporadically released a few singles since the mid-90s. American Automatic shows that their work could assist a Hollywood producer searching for the right background music for scenes when the hero cop marches into an ""underground club"" full of bikers, sneering dominatrixes, and hackers bent on world domination. The death disco strut of ""Demento"" marches along with fuzzed-out serial killer murmurings, clichd computer garbling, and bass drops. Kill Memory Crash also kick in obligatory nods to metal with synthesized guitar riffs, although on the auto-piloted ""Battery"" they lack the belt-sanding friction of Ministry and KMFDM. To its credit, the group has a good ear for synth programming, as exemplified by ""Doorway Nine""'s flickering electro-funk melodies. Elsewhere, the duo adds murmuring deadpan vocals to a few tracks, disrupting those drones with DSP misfiring that snaps the listener awake. In all, it's like the band itself woke up from 15 years of sleep and picked up where industrial left off.","Ghostly International releases the latest from Chicago's industrial veterans.

Making Beds in a Burning House,Troubled Hubble,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89d5e6ef95969321256/1:1/w_160/d05ab827.jpg,2005-05-30 06:01:36,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8289-making-beds-in-a-burning-house/,Lookout!,"Beginning with their quirky name, Illinois-based touring machines Troubled Hubble are a nerdy blast from the too-recent-to-be-trendy past. Their style neatly summarizes the musical epoch before Travis Morrison lost his mojo-- back when Built to Spill were newly perfect, Isaac Mouse had nothing to think about, and ""soccer moms"" drove ""minivans"" instead of leather-upholstered tanks (eff you, H2!). Like a ""Happy Days"" for the geek-rock '90s, Troubled Hubble's 2002 word-of-mouth breakthrough, Penturbia, was all that, but jollier, idealized. Troubled Hubble's Lookout! debut, Making Beds in a Burning House, is actually their fourth full-length. In many ways, it's an evolution from its predecessors: cleaner recording quality, a few strings 'n' horns, and self-consciously literate lyrics (holy Hapsburg Empire, ""defenestrate""?). Indeed, singer/guitarist Chris Otepka hurls his words in a Mountain Goats-like torrent, reedy voice and all. ""That candle in the window is gonna be the reason your whole house burns,"" Otepka warns before jumping breathlessly to another image and then another over Andrew Lanthrum's lithe, impossibly Dismembered bass line on superficially upbeat opener ""14000 Things to Be Happy About"". Then again, the rush of staccato verbiage on ""Ear Nose & Throat"" brushes awkwardly close to R.E.M./Billy Joel list-song terrain (what else do I have to say?!). A few standouts seem likely to bump up against the latest Clem Snide on your local college radio station. ""To Be Alive and Alone"" is a catchy, chiming affirmation of your between-classes quarter-life crisis (""It's nice to see you back in the game,"" Otepka begins, hoping to ""play""-- get it?). Going on a road trip? Throw meticulously straight-faced ""Floribraska"" onto your spring break mix disc. ""There's no place like the Midwest except the Southeast,"" quoth Otepka. The album's most memorable new song, ""Even Marathon Runners Need to Nap"" is a gradually expanding mid-tempo indie-rocker worthy of a Grand Canyon wake and bake, or at least the library psychedelia of its forebears. For all the strides Troubled Hubble have made (the dread ""maturation""!), in some ways Making Beds in a Burning House is unsatisfyingly retrograde, even beyond its derivativeness. For starters, nothing here rivals college radio fave ""I Love My Canoe"", which has appeared on two previous albums. And the song you'll leave humming? Bonus track ""Nancy"", essentially a guitar-based take on self-titled-era Ben Folds Five wimp-pop-- originally from Penturbia. Still, it's hard to complain while listening to the closing lines, which offer a glimpse into Troubled Hubble's charming worldview, or at least a decent AIM profile: ""What inspires you/ Should entire you/ Live how you want to be loved.""","Nineties nerd-pop from Lookout!

Gilles Peterson in Africa,Gilles Peterson,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0495e6ef9596931fef1/1:1/w_160/bc9d64db.jpg,2005-05-30 06:01:35,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6252-gilles-peterson-in-africa/,Ether,"When Fela Kuti died in 1997, he probably couldn't have imagined the interest his passing would spark in African popular music. The world at large viewed him out of the corner of its eye throughout much of his life, fully realizing what it had lost when hundreds of thousands of people turned up at his funeral. Since that year, intrepid reissue labels, DJs, and archivists (not mention MCA/Universal) have leapt headfirst into the kaleidoscopic world of modern African music, turning up hundreds of lost and little-known recordings. The excavation and display of vintage Afropop has been a treat for anyone who likes a good beat, though, and I suppose this makes Gilles Peterson's foray into Africa inevitable. Peterson is a venerable DJ and label owner, champion of a broad definition of dance music, and something of a tastemaker, who, according to the liners of this two-disc mix, first got into Fela and Manu Dibango back in the 80s. Gerry Lyseight's liners also try to subtly imply that Peterson himself has unearthed the Peter King and Letta Mbulu tracks included here, though I bet Russ Dewbury would have something to say about that. The oddest thing about Gilles Peterson in Africa is how far from the cutting edge it feels-- there's little here among the vintage tracks that I haven't heard before, presented more congruously on some other release, and a few of the remixes he includes on the second disc aren't terribly interesting or even au currant. That's not to say Peterson hasn't gathered a bunch of killer tracks. After a brief ""Intro"" (which is actually nicked from Oneness of Juju's ""African Rhythms""), Peterson drops Oscar Sulley & the Uhuru Dance Band's astounding big-band funk cut ""Bukom Mashie"", a long-unreleased track that's deservedly made the rounds of Afrobeat compilations since Soundway's Miles Cleret dusted it off a few years ago for Ghana Soundz. It's an outstanding track with a dive-bombing bassline and king-sized horns, but the presence of the brief, extraneous intro slightly clouds its impact. Most of Disc One, subtitled ""The Soul"", is solid, with relatively obscure picks from Fela and Dibango-- ""Ye Ye De Smell"" is an early Fela stomper typical of the awesome initial wave of Africa 70 recordings, Dibango's ""New Bell"" is sweet makossa funk. Peterson pulls Peter King's excellent ""Ajo"" from Harmless' out-of-print AfricaFunk compilation and drops in a few of great South African tracks culled from Strut's similarly unavailable Club Africa discs, Miriam Makeba's ""Samba"" and Letta Mbulu's awesome Afro-soul track ""Mahlalela"", a stunning display of vocal virtuosity. South African jazz gets its day as well with ""Did You Hear that Sound"" by Abdullah Ibrahim (aka Dollar Brand), a dark ride on spare piano chords and splashy ride cymbal. A couple of outstanding Ethio-jazz tracks occupy the middle of the disc-- and the style's inventor and master Mulatu Astatqe is represented on both. ""Mulatu"" is taken from his 1972 U.S.-recorded LP Mulatu of Ethiopia and resembles a stripped-down version of his best-known song, ""Netsanet"", while ""Asmarina"" is curiously attributed to Feqadu Amde-Mesqel, though its original home was an LP called Yekatit\xD0Ethio-Jazz, credited to Mulatu Astatke featuring Fekadu Amde Maskal. Amde-Mesqel is the song's author and his stunning flute playing dominates the track, but I still question the credit. Heading over to Disc Two (""The Spirit""), things are a little less even. OK, a lot less. I love what Masters at Work and Wunmi do on ""MAW Expensive (Tribute to Fela)"", mixing up the ""Expensive Shit"" groove and horn parts with Wunmi's impassioned reading of ""Upside Down"", Fela's brilliant protest of the imposition of European patrinomic systems on local African populations. The groove isn't as forceful in the hands of the Masters, but the looser, lighter edge plays better to a female vocalist than the Africa 70's militaristic onslaught. Otherwise, Congolese wrecking crew Konono No. 1's ""Lufuala Ndonga"" is still heavy as hell and hugely exciting, David Byrne & Thievery Corporation get nicely funky on ""The Heart's a Lonely Hunter"" and the ""High Life mix"" of Dennis Ferrer's ""Funu"" works nicely enough, but that's as far as I get on the second half of the set. Honestly, Carl Craig's remix of Cesaria Evora's ""Angola"" can't hold a children's birthday candle to the original, and Osborne's ""Afrika"" has a nice vocal, but a totally wooden club beat that doesn't make me want to dance nearly as much as the simple bassline of ""Bukom Mashie"". Overall, this a bunch of good tracks placed together in a manner that doesn't validate Peterson's reputation for impeccable sequencing, and a few tracks supposedly in the Afrobeat spirit that don't exactly measure up to the real thing. There's value here certainly, and if you're feeling like a little tourist jaunt into vintage Afropop, the first disc is a nice collection of good old songs, assembled in a decidedly touristic manner\xD0the fact that a few of these tracks (read: ""Mahlalela"" and ""Mulatu"") are pretty hard to find elsewhere helps, too. If you're really looking for a solid, focused introduction to African popular music, though, there are plenty of better options, including MCA's Fela reissues, anything on Soundway or Strut (Strut stuff is out of print but available if you look around hard enough) and Buda Musique's Ethiopiques series.","2xCD Afropop mix from the veteran DJ features Fela Kuti, Miriam Makeba, and Mulatu Astatqe, among others.

Martha Wainwright,Martha Wainwright,by: Stephen M.

Kate notes how ""he looked her in the eyes/ Just like a boy of 19 would do."" And even though Martha is facing someone who is a stranger, relative, and musical forebear, ""she was not afraid/No, she was not afraid."" It's only one of innumerable songs the Wainwright clan has written about each other, but nine years later, ""Matapedia"" sounds particularly prescient. Martha Wainwright's fearlessness has not abated with age, but has found an outlet in the family business. Like her parents and brother, Martha writes candidly and often hostilely about the people around her, be they lovers, friends, or family. She has her father's name (as well as an album cover that mimics his 1975 Unrequited), is blessed with her mother's gracefully lilting voice, and borrows her older brother Rufus's witty frankness. She generally composes in the 70s folk singer-songwriter mode: Every song seems to have originated with only her voice and acoustic guitar. Some songs remain in this bare-bones state, but she elaborates on most tracks with enough rock, pop, and even country elements that they never sound like exercises in nostalgia. But it's her lyrics and vocals that are the focus of this debut. Martha doesn't write hooks so much as she inflects them with a versatile voice that moves fluidly from intimate exhalations (""Don't Forget"") to angry exhortations (""Ball & Chain"") to florid cascades of backing oohs and aahs (""Far Away""). The refrain of ""Factory""-- ""I'll take the coast from factory to factory""-- remains in your head not because of the words' inherent rhythms, but because Martha rushes the first two, draws out the long o in ""coast,"" then rushes the last phrase as her voice rises excitably. Lyrically, she has a penchant for sly wordplay and frank confession, addressing romantic masochism and what she calls ""sexual psychology"" in ""Ball & Chain"". But her forthrightness can be highly deceptive. On ""TV Show"", she sings, ""So when you touch me there I'm scared you'll see/ Not the way that I don't love you/ But the way I don't love myself."" Deciphering those double negatives couldn't be more difficult: On first listen, it sounds like she loves the song's subject, but hates herself, but that extra ""don't"" between the ""I"" and the ""love you"" muddies the meaning. It's all a question of syntax, yet that one extra word thoroughly complicates the song while directly, even intimately involving the listener in her drama. Of course, family plays a strong role on these songs. In addition to appearances by Kate (playing banjo on ""Factory"" and piano on ""Don't Forget"") and Rufus (singing on ""The Maker""), she writes about their tumultuous family with a candor that would be more remarkable if it weren't a genetic trait. Martha's song about her father is called ""Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole"", and the pun of the title in no way detracts from the cathartic defiance of the lyrics: ""I will not pretend/ I will not put on a smile/ I will not say I'm all right for you."" Yet, despite the endless comparisons these family dramas provoke, Martha Wainwright proves Martha Wainwright has a strong, distinct, fully formed musical identity, which would be just as impressive by any other name.","Rufus' sister sounds not unlike her parents, Kate McGarrigle and Louden Wainwright III.

Produced By Trevor Horn,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a839c0084474cd0c0da2/1:1/w_160/714b7216.jpg,2005-05-26 06:01:42,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2068-produced-by-trevor-horn/,ZTT,"In the early 1980s, British producer Trevor Horn built a sound-- thundering drums, zinging samples, Valkryie orchestral fanfares-- that married orchestral disco, prog ambition, hip-hop crunch, and soundtrack pomp with a knowing wink. But, losing both his key collaborators and the wink as his career progressed, all that was left was the bombast-- Celine Dion with a Fairlight sampler. This occasionally maddening two-disc best-of is perhaps closer to the nut of his output than a perfectly curated selection would be. Unfortunately, it's not always more listenable for telling the truth. If Horn's main legacy had been as a member of the Buggles, he'd be a footnote to the history of MTV. Instead, he hooked up with an ailing pair of schlockmeisters calling themselves Dollar, then a scrappy post-punk soul band called ABC, and promptly became the biggest producer in Britain. He climaxed mid-decade by co-creating the world's first apocalyptic queer boy band in Frankie Goes To Hollywood and helping to pants the industry in Art of Noise. Perhaps reeling from the backlash these projects engendered in the buying public, he finished out the decade with a succession of slick MOR. He was last seen smuggling T.a.t.u. into the west (yay) and producing Belle & Sebastian (eh). The first disc of Produced is the longer and spottier of the two. ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and Frankie's ""Relax"" are part of the shared cultural hertiage of anyone born between 1968-1980. ABC's ""Poison Arrow"" is stop-start dynamics on a Wagnerian scale-- Bond composer John Barry meets disco pioneer Georgio Moroder. His work with male glamazon Sealhenry Samuel was his last stab at anything like ""relevance,"" and ""Crazy"" remains a fine hi-gloss distillation of Soul II Soul's mixture of eerie and euphoric. But Simple Minds and Spandau Ballet are bad bands in a way that no amount of historical revisionism is going to tame, and LeeAnn Rimes' ""Can't Fight The Moonlight"" is no sane person's idea of a comeback. Neither is T.a.t.u.'s ""All the Things She Said"", though it does at least tip its hat to the homo-hysteria of FGTH. The second disc makes a pretty good case for Horn as, warts and all, the best producer of the 80s. (Marley Marl may trump him. Prince is Prince.) Horn's lost-weekend as a member of Yes (as bizarre-yet-right as Pharrell joining Pearl Jam) produced one undeniable classic in ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"". The Art of Noise's ""Beat Box"" predicts the boom-bap of late-80s rap, looping a chest-thumping drum break from those Yes sessions and rendering everything else (orchestral blare, pixilated samples) as stabs. It marked probably the last time a group of aging white Britons would score a U.S. hip-hop hit. Frankie's ""Two Tribes"" stages nuclear annihilation as camp dancefloor pantomime, mutually assured destruction as the ultimate illicit orgasm. AON's ""Moments in Love"" lampoons new age loveliness even as it trumps it, its soft-focus synths and flushed inhalations the ultimate yuppie makeout music that transcends itself. Malcom McLaren's sly, spry cut-and-scratch ""Buffalo Gals"" turned the Sex Pistol's slimeball into the most unexpected rap star ever (except maybe Mel Brooks). ABC's ""The Look of Love"" was modern classicism at its most overwrought (live strings and horns, booming tympani, Martin Fry's strained vocal) and their ""All of My Heart"" may be the most beautiful thing Horn (and the band) ever made. (I still can't figure out what's making those starchild/space whale gurgles on the outro.) There has been much debate as to how much Horn contributed to his various projects. (After the band's falling out, The Art of Noise's J.J. Jeczalik calculated Horn's involvement at slightly less than 2%.) Judging by his later, less radical (both sonically and conceptually) work, Horn was a gifted but often uninspired studio boffin when the catalytic agent of people like AON/Frankie co-creator Paul Morley, ABC's Martin Fry, and McLaren was out of the picture. But no matter what his actual involvement (and personally I'd put it at a lot higher than 2%), Horn was the glue. The music endures, 20 years later, even if Produced By Trevor Horn isn't always its best showcase. If you don't already own the original records, all can be found cheap and all (especially ABC's Lexicon of Love) are essential documents of their era.","A maddeningly scattershot collection of the frequently brilliant production work of ex-Buggles and Art of Noise leader Trevor Horn.

Luc's Lantern,William Parker,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff85e6ef9596931fe53/1:1/w_160/dc29e3b8.jpg,2005-05-26 06:01:41,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6174-lucs-lantern/,Thirsty Ear,"Since its inauguration in 2000, Thirsty Ear's Blue Series has predominantly directed its focus towards the future horizons of avant-jazz, uniting disparate acts such as Spring Heel Jack, El-P, and DJ Spooky with some of today's top free-playing musicians to create several dazzlingly modern mutant hybrids. But on Luc's Lantern, William Parker's latest contribution to the series, the ever-prolific bassist/composer has crafted a song suite decidedly steeped in pure bop traditionalism, resulting in what is perhaps the least innovative album in his enormous discography. And though there's little here that would've sounded too outlandish on a typical Blue Note release ca. 1959, Parker is able to infuse these compositions with enough of his melodic, uniquely tender vitality to keep the album from ever resembling a rote museum piece. Joining Parker for this session are drummer Michael Thompson and the classically-trained pianist Eri Yamamoto, a pair considerably less fire-breathing than such past Parker collaborators as Cecil Taylor, David S. Ware, or Hamid Drake. And though both players here sound perfectly capable of matching their leader's stride, there are several points through the likes of ""Adena"" or ""Evening Star Song"" where they defer to Parker's bass a bit too readily while he-perhaps not fully realizing his own strength-- casually outmuscles his bandmates to the front of the mix. Even so, the trio here realize several peaks of vibrant melodicism and supple cohesion, never more so than on the pair of glowing mid-album tributes ""Jaki"" and ""Bud in Alphaville,"" which pay respectful homage to their jazz pianist forbears Jaki Byard and Bud Powell, both of whom performed with another of this set's obvious touchstones, Charles Mingus. On ""Jaki"" the three musicians settle into an amiable saunter that sounds as though it'd be ready to convert into a stripped-down version of Mingus' ""Fables of Faubus"" at the arch of an eyebrow, while on ""Bud in Alphavilla"", Yamamoto expertly echoes Powell's Bird-inspired single-note runs and nimble chords with Thompson adding flawless cymbal-crashing punctuation to the tune's every tight corner. Throughout the album the musicians each keep their solos crisp and restrained, subordinating their playing to Parker's deft songcraft. This tasteful understatement yields great dividends on tracks like the wearily romantic ballad ""Charcoal Flower"" or the vivid ""Phoenix"", which features Yamamoto pounding out barrelhouse chords by the fistful, sounding just a shot or two removed from the honky-tonk. Given Parker's almost super-human productivity-- he's appeared as leader or sideman on upwards of 40 albums since 2000-- his fans can afford to be fussy about which portions of his catalog they decide to sample. And with its adroit, seemingly effortless take on traditionalism, Luc's Lantern should prove to be as accessible a point of entry as a newcomer could hope for, and as a refreshing, uncomplicated rear-view glance for Parker's established jazz audience.","Latest release from Thirsty Ear's Blue Series.

See You Next Tuesday,Fannypack,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be6dc0084474cd0c2eab/1:1/w_160/c97cc935.jpg,2005-05-26 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3260-see-you-next-tuesday/,Tommy Boy,"Avenue D might have just gone ahead and called the record Cunt, but that'd be all 2001 electro-sleazy; the teeny euphemism suits this group better. It's still up in the air why Fannypack ever got free-associated with NYC's willfully trashy hipster subcult in the first place, not when they were so clearly something else. Cartoon booty-bass, day-glo club squeakers, drop-rolling L'Trimm revivalism: Novelty hit or not, the stuff had enough meat to cross casually from Manhattan party kids to hip-hop radio play. Who doesn't get a kick out of teenage girls kicking beautifully bratty schoolyard rhymes? It's like Daphne and Celeste without the irony-- and with beats that once bounced like nothing else around. It wasn't a formula anyone expected them to repeat, and they're wise not to try. It's 2005, you know, and the last member of the crew is legal now: With this second album, they're ready to take direction from Tyra Banks and get ""fierce."" The transition from happy teenage taunts to cursing and sex talk was probably inevitable, and quality-wise, it's a wash. It's with the sound-- as provided by producers Matt Goias and Fancy-- that you get your payoff. No more bubbly electroid jump here; at its most distinctive, this record unleashes rhythm-happy stomps that kick and clap like black-college step routines. ""Keep it Up"", ""Feet and Hands"", and ""Pump It"" leaven their beats with crowd cheers, whistles, hand-claps, marching drums, even sneaker squeaks; for indie kids, this may be as good as the high school gym will ever sound. Something about that pep-squad energy brings out the old Fannypack, too. With these cuts, it's still all about drawers of broken cellphones and time-tested taunts like ""you're gonna pump my gas someday."" The space around that gets more adult-serious, taking stabs at all the relevant radio staples: Say, sub-Missy r&b; crooning for ""On My Lap"" (that one's about male strippers), or sub-Missy Diwali-styled riddim on ""Fire Fire"", which brings in Jamaican singer/toaster Mr. Vegas to cover the hook. Brooklyn ode ""Seven One Eight"" whips out dusty blues samples for an odd, clanky strut. And then, swinging in from the complete opposite direction, there's ""You Gotta Know""-- an unexpectedly Off the Wall roller-disco jam that just might be the best thing this group's ever done. The results don't have much on the pure cartoon charm of Fannypack's debut, and in spots they're left in a disappointing limbo-- wanting to compete on equal, adult terms with the tracks on the radio, but way too adorable and idiosyncratic to pull it off. We'll call them growing pains, though; getting too excited about the bratty day-glo remnants that shine through here may be the equivalent of wanting your daughter to stay prepubescent for all eternity. No, this stuff has got some thrills of its own, with male strippers right up among them. And if you happen to be the main character in an unexpected prequel to Bring It On, well: You can skip the drive down to Compton, and steal your step-step cheer routines right here.","NYC quintet transition from happy teenage taunts and bubbly electro to cursing and rhythm-happy stomps.

Batards Sensibles,TTC,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a824c0084474cd0c0d77/1:1/w_160/096e9362.jpg,2005-05-26 06:01:39,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8178-batards-sensibles/,Big Dada,"Do yourself a favor, and don't talk to any French people about TTC. Talk to them about how much your country sucks or how great they are. They're good at that. After listening to Batards Sensibles, I really wanted to go the extra mile for all you future hate-mailers out there. The massive Euro-club beats and skanky charisma of Teki Latex, Tido Berman, and Cuizinier motivated me to do something special. I'm super lazy though, so that extra mile turned out to be the hundred yards to my neighbor's, a friendly young Parisian who'd agreed to some lyric translation in exchange for pretty much nothing. See, I took Latin in high school, and that shit is worthless. I could have used pro bono two sentences ago, and it would have been the lone justification for three years of study. Just as well because, from what the neighbor told me, TTC's lyrical content is no loftier than a 50 Cent guest spot. Plenty of club-friendly nonsense about smacking people, bitches being hoes, etc, But every time she translated something, it was accompanied by a blushing giggle, the same kind of giggle that American women give in response to Ludacris or Cam'ron. It's the ""you nasty"" giggle, and it told me more about TTC's modus operandi (yes!) than any translation ever would. TTC are poseurs in the best of ways, mack thespians with a penchant for steady slobbin' on your earlobe. They are as willfully lecherous as Serge G. at his best, and their producers, Tacteel and Para One, match the MC's cartoon cadences with the oh-so-French art of sardonic electro-funk, with DJ Orgasmic the Toxicologist (I know) on the cut. Much like their successful compatriots, Daft Punk, TTC sound like they're having loads of laughs at our expense. Songs go from acid-squelched hyperbolic gangsterism (""Du Sang Sur Le Dancefloor"") to corny 1980s bounce that could easily have played during any number of Rusty's hijinks in European Vacation (""Les Chants Des Hommes""). The title track's video better involve leather-clad werewolves or someone's not trying very hard. The production pulls as much from indigenous club music as it does from crunk or the more progressive of America's underground crews-- APC comes to mind-- yet, American influence is tangential. Batards Sensibles is brethren to London's grime scene in its use of Stateside hip-hop as an inspiration, not a template. It draws from a more mainstream pool, which immediately makes it more accessible than a lot of grime, but the formula is the same. Its undeniable French-ness is its greatest asset, providing an alternative to its American counterpart where previous Franco hip-hop like MC Solaar and Supreme NTM were novel regurgitations. The allure is not only in the production, though. Teki, Tido, and Cuizinier are as captivating and entertaining as any, despite the language barrier. Tido is nonchalant, laying up in the cut, running things. The boyish Cuizinier postures as lewd seducer, green gangster, and club ruler from song to song, the transparency of his schtick as endearing as those moments on hip-hop records when someone has his baby say ""fuck you, motherfucker."" And then there's Teki. Oh, sweet Teki. Sounding like an exiled Muppet, his voice is so surly and indignant that you just want to fill him full of beer and watch him ruin the party. Crews need distinct personalities, and there's no deficiency of character in any of these three. Possibly in an attempt to fulfill their label's English-language quotient, TTC brings in L.A. natives Busdriver and Radioinactive to spit approximately a billion words apiece on ""Latest Dance Craze"". If you're still intent on deciphering the lyrics, don't eat for a few hours, go to TTC's website, and have Google translate it for you. The not eating is so you don't puke from laughing when you witness the brilliance. ""All the she-cats of the whores are moist,"" apparently. Of course they are, Teki Latex. Don't forget to ""give opera hats to their bottoms,"" playboy.","Cartoon cadences and sardonic electro-funk from this Big Dada French hip-hop group.

The Further Adventures of Lord Quas,Quasimoto,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c113d19756521386e4/1:1/w_160/8faf6ddd.jpg,2005-05-26 06:01:38,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6612-the-further-adventures-of-lord-quas/,Stones Throw,"A friend of mine suggested that I give the new Quasimoto album a positive review without even hearing it. He argued that Madlib and his pig-faced sidekick are so unique that critics shouldn't discourage their creativity. Obviously, that's just not the way it works-- records can't be rewarded purely based on speculation or concept. Otherwise, Macho Man's Be a Man would be the greatest album of all time. Those types of comments aren't surprising coming from a Madlib fan, though. The artist has a vice-like grip on a whole legion of followers, many of which are loyal enough to his creative muse that, for them, the joy of a genuinely rewarding listen is secondary to the joy of just hearing what he cooks up. This is actually not awful logic: Madlib's work is generally worth seeking out, even when it's beneath his usual standards. The problem here is that pieces of Misadventures simply aren't finished. Who wants to be the first to say it? I mean, on one hand, if it's unfocused, it's probably because it's a fucking stoner album. If it's slow, then it's reflective; if it's sparse, then it's minimalist. But again, taking it at face value, on those terms, would be to gloss over missteps out of deference to the record's concept. We aren't all stoners, and the sad truth is, ""Bus Ride"" really is just a couple of monotonous Melvin Van Peebles samples, and Madlib's snickerings, lugubrious bloops and weedtalk on ""Greenery"" really aren't all that fascinating. I'm a huge Madlib fan, but there's a lot of nonsense here. Were Madlib not the stoned-face iconoclast we all know and love, it would be easy to point to these kinds of seemingly mindless excursions as pomposity. (That loop at the end of ""Shroom Music""? The 30-second Nick at Nite samples? Come on, dude.) But Madlib isn't pretentious; he's just imperfect, and when you head into a project like this expecting-- even hoping for-- 27 stream-of-conscious studio experiments, it colors the whole thing differently. In Madlib's defense, there is a ton of evidence of his genius at work here. Shit, cut out a half-dozen two-minute sleepers and the rest of the material is actually rock solid: ""Rappcats, Pt. 3"" buzzes with breakbeat intensity as Quas rips through his all-time favorite MCs, and Doom returns with some Madvillainy shine on ""Closer"". As an album, though, The Further Adventures of Lord Quas doesn't cut it. I'll admit that somewhere in here lies a damn strong record, but it takes a lot of fast-forwarding to find it.","Madlib goes Avalanches with this sample bonanza. If you're handy with the fast-forward button, somewhere within its 27 tracks is a glorious album.

A Retrospective: 1995-2000,Son Volt,by: Stephen M.

After the back-to-back releases of Wilco's lackluster A.M. and Son Volt's lived-in Trace, Farrar seemed destined for greatness, and Tweedy destined for obscurity. A few years later, I saw how wrong I was: It wasn't simply that Being There was that great a follow-up, but that Straightaways was such a fatally dull second album. Full of bland retreads of Trace songs, it started off ho-hum and went downhill from there, backloaded with so many downtempo, amelodic tracks that even Farrar couldn't seem to muster a committed performance. As Wilco became one of the most critically celebrated bands in America, Son Volt tried to broaden its sound on Wide Swing Tremolo, but they were so stuck in a rut they could only disband, and Farrar released a couple of solo records that re-established a core audience without attracting much attention. Now, amid a softening nostalgia for the mini-movement Uncle Tupelo helped define and plans for a new Son Volt album this summer, Rhino is issuing A Retrospective: 1995-2000. Making absolutely no promise of definitiveness, the title says it all: It's 20 tracks culled from the band's three albums, along with a handful of covers and live takes. Right off the bat, something seems askew: A Retrospective begins with ""Drown"" instead of ""Windfall"", which is both the lead-off track on Trace and the quintessential alt-country song, a perfect summation of the genre's aesthetic as it fuses travel, a.m. radio, steel guitar, and a driving desire to connect to something larger and older than yourself. That it has been relegated to second-track position seems an oversight, as are the omissions of Trace's Ron Wood cover ""Mystifies Me"", Straightaways's opener ""Caryatid Easy"", and Wide Swing Tremolo's ""Dead Man's Clothes"". ""Drown"" (or, as I called it in college, ""You're Cousin It"") is perhaps the band's most recognizable track, but in the context of A Retrospective, it sounds nearly indistinguishable from songs like ""Picking Up the Signal"", ""Creosote"", and ""Driving the View"", all of which utilize the same formula: tight mid-tempo rhythm section with no drum fills; wide-open guitar sound; a big, low voice delivering lyrics that don't always bother to make sense. The number of such tracks on A Retrospective makes it surprisingly monotonous, especially for a best-of comp that has so much material from which to cull. Aside from the live acoustic versions of a few songs, the added extras on A Retrospective are six covers that exhibit a greater diversity than the album tracks. Son Volt's late-90s take on the Del Reeves trucker anthem ""Looking Through a Windshield"" has aged about as well as early-00s trucker caps, and Farrar can't muster the excitability on Springsteen's ""Open All Night"" to sell lines like ""I'm goin' out tonight/ I'm gonna rock that joint."" But his hangdog vocals contrast dramatically with Kelly Willis's sharp croon on Townes Van Zandt's ""Rex's Blues"", and Farrar sounds like a drunk staggering down the hall-- in the best way possible-- on Alex Chilton's ""Holocaust"". I don't begrudge Son Volt their modesty of sound and scope, nor do I hold it against them that they weren't Uncle Tupelo or Wilco. There is something refreshing, if only briefly so, about the band's unalterably limited range, especially when compared with Tweedy's self-consciously aggressive innovation. If nothing else, A Retrospective at least marks the moment when these three bands have diverged so dramatically from each other that any comparison between them becomes more nostalgic than musical.","Compilation collects the best of Jay Farrar's post-Uncle Tupelo also-rans.

The Forgotten Arm,Aimee Mann,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3985e6ef95969323876/1:1/w_160/4ec860c1.jpg,2005-05-25 06:01:44,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5084-the-forgotten-arm/,Superego,"All conceptual trappings aside-- the love-story conceit, the lyrics printed in paragraph form in the insert booklet, the book-like look of the CD sleeve-- The Forgotten Arm is no more conceptual albumthan any other Aimee Mann album. Regardless of what is sung or who she sings with, the underlying message is often the same-- life is tough, love can make life easier and even tougher all at once, and the crap folks put up with for love is both admirable and ridiculous. For this album, Mann chose to talk about this theme through the trials and tribulations of two characters, delineating their dissolution and resolution linearly, over the course of 12 songs. The story in The Forgotten Arm is girl (Caroline) meets boxer (John) at a county fair, boxer and girl go gaga for each other, boxer and girl go on the road, boxer is addicted to drugs, girl cuts boxer loose, boxer wises up to his problem and quits the stuff, boxer and girl ride off into the sunset. The title of the album refers to a boxing maneuver wherein a fighter in close quarters uses one arm to punch and lets the other arm hide in plain sight, waiting to land a surprise blow. No doubt this idea of a sucker punch fits perfectly with the ups and downs of Caroline and John's cross-country tryst-- falling in love, learning about your lover's drug addiction, the addict finding out he's being dumped. It's also a maneuver Mann uses adeptly within songs, dropping in a deceptively powerful detail that snaps a scene into sharp focus, like this couplet from ""The King in the Jailhouse"": ""...they pack up their troubles in an old Cadillac-- that's her in the mirror, asleep in the back."" Musically, The Forgotten Arm is a down-to-earth version of what folks expect from an Aimee Mann record. Joe Henry's production doesn't offer the multi-instrumental whimsy of Mann's best-known work with Jon Brion, though there are moments (such as when the mandolin comes into play on ""Video"") that briefly recall those songs. Otherwise, it's a straight-up rock record essayed live-to-tape by a handful of studio pros. Sometimes, the ""studio pro"" vibe is a bit too redolent-- see those ""forgotten arm"" wee-er wee-er wanky guitar moments-- but these folks otherwise do a fine job in letting Mann's songs shine. And this is an Aimee Mann record through and through. Even though she's writing songs under the guise of two different characters, it's her lyrical voice that's actually speaking. If you're able to suspend disbelief enough so that a junkie boxer can talk about being trapped in a ""cone of silence"" or observe that ""all the sweet green trees of Atlanta burst like little bombs, or little pom-poms,"" then you might be up for a high-ranking position in the U.S. government. Regardless of the happy ending of John and Caroline's story, there's no treacly moments to be had. The resolution is a hard-fought one, with plenty of knocks collected along the way for both characters. Mann's despondent deadpan eloquence, as it's been for her entire career, is perfect for delineating each of these bumps and bruises in loving detail. After all, this is a songwriter that had some of the best actors in Hollywood singing, ""It's not going to stop until you wise up."" Don't go thinking she's going to take it easy now that she's directing and scripting her own characters. So, yeah, here's yet another exemplary Aimee Mann album to add to the pile.

Push Barman to Open Old Wounds,Belle and Sebastian,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2625e6ef959693203e1/1:1/w_160/baa877af.jpg,2005-05-25 06:01:43,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/637-push-barman-to-open-old-wounds/,Matador,"In the process of moving, I stumbled upon a box of cassettes, chief among them were Belle and Sebastian-related items-- live sets from 1997 and 1998, BBC sessions, The Black Sessions, Tigermilk recorded at a time when the record's proper distribution was limited to 1,000 vinyl copies. Cassettes-- it all seemed so quaint. What's more, B&S; were perhaps the last UK indie act that listeners engaged with through the late 70s/80s model of John Peel plays, weekly mag coverage, BBC sessions, 7""'s. It made sense: Many early converts were lapsed indie listeners or former P!O!P! kids who gave up on insularity and constructing worlds around their musical obsessions; people who couldn't imagine wearing badges like medals, passing their fandom around like a secret handshake, having a devotion to an artist serve as a conversation icebreaker. The band did itself no shortage of favors constructing its own myth, quickly refusing to speak to the music press and hatching phony liner-note tales. On record, they also created their own sense of mystique via the self-referential metapop of ""Belle & Sebastian"", a hidden, unnamed track at the end 3...6...9 that addressed their press-shy behaviour, and the in-jokes and self-deprecation that plays over the churning, Velvets-y second act of ""This Is Just a Modern Rock Song"". Among Belle & Sebastian's many throwback habits were valuing the single and the EP as a separate entity from the album. Push Barman to Open Old Wounds collects this non-LP output, originally spread over seven EPs released between 1997 and 2001. This set compiles all of B&S;' Jeepster-era singles tracks save an extended version of the instrumental ""Judy Is a Dick Slap"", which appeared on the ""Legal Man"" 12"". The first half is the three four-track EPs clumsily packaged as the Lazy Line Painter Jane set-- that box's title EP plus Dog on Wheels and 3...6...9 Seconds of Light, all released in 1997. The second half features their four EPs released from 1998-2001: This Is Just a Modern Rock Song, Legal Man, Jonathan David, and I'm Waking Up to Us. The 1997 EPs kicked off with Dog on Wheels, which featured three 1996 demos plus ""String Bean Jean"". In all, the tracks romanticized childhood, wrung happy memories out of post-university poverty, and lamented the fleeting nature of happiness. 3...6...9 and Lazy Line Painter Jane increasingly took advantage of the collective swelling in ranks, adding lush strings and increasingly highlghting Mick Cooke's trumpet playing. On the whole, the three carried echoes of the whitewashed soul and puritanism of Orange Juice and Scot indiekid fave Vic Godard is evident in the band's quaint, fey, self-deprecating lyrics. Collected as a whole, these dozen tracks are probably the quintessential Belle and Sebastian album, and ""The State That I'm In"" (included here is a demo version) and ""A Century of Fakers"" are still arguably their best songs. On the surface the EPs created an idealized world of childhood memories, books, crushes, bicycle rides, and faded photos. But no mere shrinking violet, Stuart Murdoch traded in ""la-la-la""'s and also spent time threatening that ""if you ever go lardy or go lame, I will drop you straightaway"", and wondering how to ""tell [one's] folks about a dose of thrush."" Kicking off the second disc are the This Is Just a Modern Rock Song and Legal Man EPs, which, at the time, seemed like the band's first real distress signals. As on 1998's The Boy With the Arab Strap, Murdoch ceded some of the songwriting duties to his bandmates (to Isobel Campbell on this set's nadir, ""The Gate"", to the recently departed Stuart David with the inclusion of ""Winter Wooskie"", and to the band itself with raveups ""Legal Man"" and ""Judy Is a Dick Slap"") and includes his own B&S; MK. 1 low, ""I Know Where the Summer Goes"". Murdoch's one moment of true inspiration, Wildean heartbreaker ""Slow Graffiti"", was commissioned for the film version of Irvine Welsh's The Acid House, suggesting that perhaps his internal muse was fleeting. With hindsight, Murdoch possibly did need a break but tracks that seemed anomalous or out-of-place at the time are far more compelling now. ""TIJAMRS"" and ""Legal Man"" still may be more cute than clever but both exude buckets of charm and display the band's emerging sense of ambition and willingness to create rather than playact. ""Wooskie"" and ""Judy"" are each a bit more by-the-numbers, but no less engaging for it and deserve to be more than the career footnotes they currently seem to be. More revealing are the two EPs that followed the disappointing Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant album and which close out this set. The move away from Murdoch's personal voice to a process of true collaboration and democritization not only initiated a sharing of songwriting duties but richer sonics and an emphasis on common touchstones, which resulted in the band favoring lush throwbacks to Northern Soul and 1960s baroque pop and sonically or lyrically referencing artists such as Love, the Beach Boys, and Motown where they once namechecked tracks and albums from more private obsessions such as Felt, Josef K, and the Pastels. The Biblical metaphor and Stevie Jackson vocals on ""Jonathan David"" aren't the post-FYH gut-punch they once were-- and the song's bridge, piano fill, and harmonies are glorious. The final A-side included here, ""I'm Waking Up to Us"", is even better. Murdoch's stilted Arthur Lee impersonation seems appropriate for the on-the-heels lyric, a constipated delivery for a track with a protagonist trying and failing to mask his pain and maintain dignity and pride while his romantic world crumbles. The baroque sophistipop arrangement is exquisite craft without sacrificing emotion for polish; listening it to it now makes it clear how unsurprising it should have been that the band would later hook up with producer Trevor Horn. Of their B-sides, the most notable is the belated release of a version of ""The Loneliness of the Middle-Distance Runner"", a longtime live favorite once tipped to follow the TIJAMRS EP as an A-side. The studio version is inferior to earlier arrangements but it's still retains a graceful, slippery beauty. The others are uniformly excellent, highlighted by the narrator of ""Take Your Carriage Clock and Shove It"" says ""boo to the business world"" but only after outlasting the more soul-crushing demands of adulthood and the return to introverted bookishness of ""Marx and Engels"". The most beloved indie pop band since the Smiths, Belle and Sebastian are also probably the best. This collection would work like their own Hatful of Hollow and Louder Than Bombs were the first half not sadly missing their early BBC Sessions, and the second forced to omit their Dear Catastrophe Waitress singles and Peel Session tracks. As it stands, the first is a testament to the power and pull of one the most singular and instantly lovable pop bands of our time; the second is a gentle suggestion that they took the correct post-mainstream fame steps after all, avoiding self-parody (see: Morrissey) and finding a way to be playful without becoming too precious (see: Lawrence in his post-Felt years). In combination, it's a perfect way into the world of Belle and Sebastian, even if the band spends the second half of the disc trying to redecorate that space.","This 2xCD release compiles Belle & Sebastian's seven Jeepster-era EPs, negating the clumsily packaged Lazy Line Painter Jane set and collecting almost all of the band's pre-Dear Catastrophe Waitress non-LP work.

Who Is Mike Jones?,Mike Jones,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb50eb335119a49ec9ee/1:1/w_160/77f8345e.jpg,2005-05-25 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4359-who-is-mike-jones/,AsylumSwishahouse,"Mike Jones is not the best Houston rapper, but he has a terrific marketing plan: brand himself. By stamping the inescapable catchphrase ""Who Is Mike Jones?"" and his phone number all over his albums and chopped-up mixtapes, he built a cottage industry out of his own accessibility. By the time Kelefa Sanneh printed Jones' phone number (281-330-8004) in The New York Times, the emcee's grassroots promo plan had already sold loads of records. (It also helped that Texas is the size of a small, self-sustainable country; every major player in the Houston scene was checking cheddar like a food inspector before the major labels started calling from the coasts.) And because Jones released his major-label debut before any of his cohorts (Slim Thug, Chamillionaire, Paul Wall), he gets to be starting line-up for the Houston takeover. Mike Jones has, to borrow my high school boyfriend's senior quote, made his name everyone's world. Jones advertises his phone number on roughly every single track of WIMJ?, often rhyming the last digit, ""fo',"" with ""Hit Mike Jones up on the low/ 'Cause Mike Jones about to blow."" After the fifth or so time you start wondering if he has anything else to talk about; nevertheless, it's charming when he shouts at us all big and charismatic like a 10-gallon car salesman-- Houston is the capital of Texas car sales and the lynchpin of America's cutthroat oil industry, after all-- and when Jones isn't bragging on his majorness or woman-hating on ""Scandalous Hoes"", his raps are about driving as pimp factor: cars flossing wood-grain dashboards, fresh coats of candy paint, and hot rims. He shouts his milk-throated Houston drawl mostly slow: because if you drive fast you might bump the underside of your 'Lac on the blacktop. I mean, have you ever driven in Houston? The highways are plugged up with leviathan wide-body pick-up trucks that could bulldoze an SUV like a cucaracha. (I'm sorry to inform Mike Jones that trucks accounted for 57% of all new vehicle sales in Houston in 2004.) There's something inherently rebellious about going 15 mph down a Houston street, all low to the ground like you're about to pounce-- a kind of ""eff-you"" to the Ford F250 gas-guzzler George W. Bush helms. Or maybe that ""eff-you"" should be ""finger-flippin' and syrup-sippin',"" as Jones raps in ""Still Tippin'"", the quietly blazin', violin-samplin' hit featuring Slim Thug and Paul Wall. Jones' verse on ""Still Tippin'"" is emblematic of Houston with its DJ Screw legacy and take-no-prisoners corporate creed, and the video is the best art film I've seen all year-- the sky is all purple, there are people rollin' everywhere!-- but the track sticks most to Slim Thugga's syrupy man-drawl, which sounds chopped and screwed without the assistance of a DJ. Jones doesn't mesmerize like S. Thugga, though his stumbled braying sounds oddly terrific over the oom-pah rhythms and screwed chorus on ""Know What I'm Sayin'""; the ""Nutcracker Suite""-alluding ""Got it Sewed Up"" (Rapid Ric's Fistful of Dollars mixtape has the actual ""Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy"" sample); and the dubby yodelayheehoodling on ""Cuttin'"". On ""Cuttin'"", incidentally, Jones is less interested in talking about nasty humping (aka cuttin') than serving his standard supper: drank, skunk, driving and, of course, blowing up. So when his ice grill softens a little on ""5 Years from Now"" and ""Grandma"", a sweet devotional to the lady who coined his catchphrase atop a beautiful guitar melody-- in an ironic twist, its sample is sped-up-- it's a nice break from Jones' relentless self-promo. Who Is Mike Jones? is an ample showcase for Swishahouse producers Michael K. Watts and Silah Williams, but it'd be a better record if Jones diversified. However, if anyone was going to prep America for the slew of forthcoming H-Town major-label releases, it's Mike Jones-- Who? Mike Jones. CALL NOW: Operators are standing by.","Personable emcee crosses Houston's Swishahouse over to the mainstream.

Strange We Should Meet Here,Idiot Pilot,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a5eb335119a49ec828/1:1/w_160/8d76fe6b.jpg,2005-05-24 05:00:06,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4161-strange-we-should-meet-here/,Reprise,"Forget chugging beer or smoking weed or huffing paint thinner-- you wanna fit in with the cool crowd, you'll listen to Radiohead. Not to sound like an insensitive, sanctimonious aficionado, but The Bends, OK Computer, and Kid A have probably been abused in more high school parties than anything some 25-year-old dude down the block sells. Enter Strange We Should Meet Here, that guy sporting an Old Navy Performance Fleece, driving his Ford Mustang, wearing his visor upside-down and popping his collar to a party mix that juxtaposes ""Karma Police"" with ""Mr. Jones"" and some Limp Bizkit track. Then again, what's to be expected from two teens fresh out of high school, gallivanting around a Seattle scene growing more infamous for its kitsch bands than famous for its rock legends? The duo, consisting of singer Michael Harris and versatile instrumentalist Daniel Anderson, reaches for a Kid A aesthetic and produces just that-- a hollow, superficial burlesque of laptop pop and space rock with none of the emotion, innovation, and flat-out substance that a band like Radiohead spew out in their sleep. Of course, condemning this record for its inferiority to Radiohead would be downright unethical, but this is no Hood or Elbow caliber aping; it's bastardization on par with Keane or Athlete. First red flag: ""A Day in the Life of a Poolshark"", which opens with harmless keyboard arpeggios, quickly turns to stale grunge electronica before degenerating to a scream-laden outro reminiscent of Linkin Park. Harris's Jekyll/Hyde singing style becomes increasingly arduous during the album as one moment he's emulating Thom Yorke's subtlest idiosyncrasies (right down to singing ""skin"" as ""ski-yayn"") and another he's shredding his vocal chords, screaming incoherently. Stuff really goes to shit by ""Morerae (The Locust)"", a pop culture dumpster beginning with a voicemail sample (""End of message, to erase this message, press '7'"") and setting the stage for ""Militance Prom"", Idiot Pilot's foray into, ahem, rap. That's right, amidst all the IDM ambience and droning, soporific vocals, Harris decides to drop some rhymes he wrote while not paying attention in social studies: ""Yo check this/ I'm-a chill like the cubes of ice/ When I mention Calcutta ya'll feel the spice/ As I roll with a two-tone cellular phone/ And get blown like inflation."" It's beyond ""rip-off."" It's beyond ""poseur."" It doesn't even know what the fuck it wants to be. It's just two kids with way too much access to recording equipment, the musical equivalent of a monkey with a hand grenade.","Radiohead bastardization on par with Keane or Athlete.

Hello More,Plane,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a197b1335d7bf16982ce/1:1/w_160/66c88a1c.jpg,2005-05-24 05:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6573-hello-more/,Dirigeable,"If the indie rock single wasn't such a constitutionally impoverished creature, Plane might've released a great one. Instead, the Chicago-based quintet felt the need to make a statement, and after the initial cochlea-tease of ""Western Avenue"" and ""Heart & Soul"", Hello More spends 20-some precious minutes emphasizing to the listener that the band's imagination is too eclectic for catchy-ass electro pop alone. I'm seeing ""Western Avenue"" as the A-side. The schmaltzy drum machine that limps all over the record works better than elsewhere in this melodic, structured context: Muted guitar chords chomp rhythmically at the splashy mechanical beat like small teeth, and Ed Anderson's cool falsetto coasts through a foursquare, Gibbardesque melody (yeah, I said it). The crisp dynamic shifts and organized flourishes whet your appetite for more of the same, especially during the radiant synth pinwheels of the chorus. The variegated beats, lush guitar pulses, cleanly shifting intensities, and svelte vocals of ""Heart & Soul"" further elevate these high hopes. It's especially frustrating that the two winners are sequenced right at the beginning of the album (after the brief overture ""Compass Tape""), so that they trick you into thinking you're in for a consistent experience. Not so; the remainder of the record is wildly erratic in every aspect, even recording quality, and it sounds more like defensive experimentation than deliberate variation. It's like taking a couple bites of a tasty peanut butter and jelly sandwich, only to find subsequent bites getting all avant-garde with ham, then onions, then sardines, then Legos. If a dynamite single wasn't enough, they even could have stretched it to a solid EP. On ""Rope"", Edgar Legzdins replaces Anderson's bright, silky falsetto with a drearier register, but it's a passable bit of silly-robot motorik homage. The straightforward emoting, acoustic strummage and injured guitar leads of the title track are nice enough; and even ""Please Save My Body From the Modern World"", with its goofy drum patterns, spongy bass throb and feel-good rock vocal could've worked on an EP, as a tacked-on ""Hey look at this wacky thing we made on the fly haha we're crazy dudes"" song. But all this excellence and decency is occluded by stillborn fragments that seem a slap in the face to Plane's songwriting chops. ""Party Train"" is among the most interesting of these, tremoloed guitars wending through a rhythmic chassis of German vocal samples and jerky drums. ""It's What I Like, Dear"" and ""Adams"" both sound like partial demos of uninspired indie rock songs, and ""Broken Woods"" is a low-carb Animal Collective substitute. I guess Plane made whatever statement they needed to make, but from a listener's perspective, Hello More could've stood to be a bit hello less.","Chicago-based quintet put their best foot forward, then make you wish they produced an EP.

Camping,Various Artists,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8485e6ef9596932118e/1:1/w_160/8d63e841.jpg,2005-05-24 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2086-camping/,Bpitch Control,"Last year, Cologne's Kompakt celebrated its one-sheet centennial by having members of its roster remix cuts from its own back catalogue. That project was documented on the double-disc set Kompakt 100, and although it wasn't the celebratory dancefloor melter that it probably should've been, its central selling point of hot us-on-us action felt tastefully in line with Kompakt's hermetically sealed sensibilities. If, as a label, you're more into the idea of creating a city than you are reflecting one, this is a good way of doing things. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Berlin's Bpitch Control, whose utilitarian and far-reaching choices have probably come at the expense of a more streamlined label identity. That's not to say that Bpitch-- helmed and founded by German techno matriarch Ellen Allien-- hasn't been as discerning over the years, but rather that they've been more willing to branch out. Nowhere is that more evident than on the label's own celebratory retrospective, Camping. A simple mix-and-match of the best cuts from the label's discography, Camping showcases six years worth of permutations of Berlinesque techno and techno-pop. From the goofy basslines of Housemeister's ""Do You Wanna Funk"" and the gloopy vocodered pop of Smash TV's ""Sad"" to the razor-sharp techno of Feadz' ""Lt Replay"" and the persistent glitch of Modeselektor's ""Don't Panic"", it pole vaults from one style to another, with only a steadfastly Germanic spirit holding it together. Fittingly, a few of the compilation's best cuts come from Allien herself. Even in their truncated forms, ""Wish"" and ""Sechsucht"" (two standouts from her excellent 2003 full-length Berlinette) rank among the best things here. Other highlights include the widescreen disco synth stabs of Kiki's massive-sounding 2002 single ""Luv Sikk"", the bizarro back porch flourishes of Hal 9000 & Sylvie Marks' recent ""Blütenspa\xDF"", and the New Order-aping synthpop of Sascha Funke's smoldering 2001 cover of ""When Will I Be Famous"". Of course, there are some misfires here as well (Camping suffers from being a bit bottom-heavy), but this is mostly a competent overview of Bpitch's healthy discography and a modest portrait of a label that has always been willing to go as far as Berlin has been willing to take it.","Berlin's Bpitch Control celebrates its 100th release with this best-of compilation.

The Magic Numbers,The Magic Numbers,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c358ea9e61561daa7ecd/1:1/w_160/46bd7ddc.jpg,2005-05-24 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5648-the-magic-numbers/,EMIHeavenly,"The Magic Numbers are easy to love. It helps that they tap the soul-stirring tropes of popdork hagiography: resolute indifference to trends, early 7-inches scarcer than the '89 Bill Ripken swear card you foolishly put in plastic, and an anti-image image that had humble rock typists at ""hirsute"" (um guilty). The late 2004 release of first single ""Hymn for Her"" introduced freedom-hating mp3-downloaders and a few eBay high-rollers to the British quartet's distinctive sound, updated 1960s folk-pop steeped in xylophone and catharsis. The cognoscenti smiled; the UK press readied its superlatives. But who needs 'em? On their self-titled, full-length debut, the Magic Numbers are easy for your mother, grandmother, older brother, kid sister and their American Idol-obsessed friends to love, too. (Is it cool to like American Idol this week? The Magic Numbers don't care.) Let's get this out of the way right now: I'm gonna have to drop the triple-A bomb. AAA stands for the ""Adult Album Alternative"" radio format, which stands for Dave Matthews Band, Train, and Matchbox 20, so Pitchfork pretty much won't stand for it. The Magic Numbers could have waxed nostalgic for the folk-pop equivalent of the nouveau new-wave and gotten the easy 6.7. Instead, they've created what will doubtless stand as 2005's best AAA record. And, contrary to that genre's built-in assumptions, it doesn't even suck. Musical bait 'n' switch hasn't been this exhilarating since Blur tapped dulcet Anglo-gospel stomp ""Tender"" as the lead single for cacophonous 1999 album 13. Newest single ""Forever Lost"" reveals the Numbers' world-dominating intentions right away. Its initial clear, ringing guitar chords owe both their tone and voicing to the alternating E and E major seventh of another AAA hit: ""No Such Thing"", which vaulted misunderestimated indie anathema John Mayer into the top 40 some three years ago. As the hook, lead singer Romeo Stodart reaches for Chris Martin's now-ubiquitous falsetto-- ""forever lost -- and shit, that kinda works, too. In between, the natural harmonies of the band's two brother-sister pairings chart the kind of melody most indie-pop groups would kill stuffed animals for. Handclaps ensue. If the reference points are a tad obvious, so is the song's appeal. To say the Magic Numbers are instantly accessible is not to say they're simplistic. The album's most emotionally charged number, the six-minute ""I See You, You See Me"", casts a vulnerable duet of self-discovery amid ever-shifting dynamics. Ornate, country-tinged guitar fills enliven several songs, particularly ""Long Legs"". Often, multiple voices will bat key lyrics back and forth like rainbow-colored beach balls, until they become a sort of joyful, lovelorn mantra-- a Polyphonic Spree for normals. The lonesome twang of ""Wheels on Fire"" hints at the great Parsons-Harris duets, though this slick album version lacks the intimacy of the leaked demo you'll find on file-sharing networks. Mostly, though, the Magic Numbers are just clean fun, from the banjo-like guitar romp of ""Morning's Eleven"" to the uptempo, tambourine-crashing power-pop of ""Love Me Like You"". So: Why not an even higher score, you ask? Though the Numbers' refreshing style merits the oft-made Mamas-and-the-Papas comparisons as well as the AAA allusions, they don't have anything close to a ""California Dreaming"". The songwriting falls a couple of times too many into timid generalities about love and loss (cf. ""Love Is a Game"", which isn't a Michelle Branch/Santana cover); the melodies, though lovely, are sometimes interchangeable. ""One more drink and I'll be fine/ One more girl to take you off my mind,"" Stodart sings on ""Mule"", but it sounds like a feeling remembered from someone else's song rather than something he's experienced. Yes, the Magic Numbers are easy to love -- but until they grow into their considerable gifts is it OK if I just really, really like them?","Hotly tipped indie pop band follow a pair of outstanding singles and a Chemical Brothers collab with this, their debut LP.

Banhart has a beard-- hey, so does my dentist. So do most Catholic priests and nuns. Newsom has a crazy voice and wears colorful clothes. Whatever. All my buddies shop at Ecko, too. So does my dentist. So does my rabbi. All you kids with your fucked-up teeth and Martin backpackers, get your weight up-- you are not freakfolk-as-fuck. You are not freakfolk in the flesh. Call it a guest spit-- though I'm done with all that, seriously, so let's just call it a spot-- Foster's solo spit on Golden Apples of the Sun made for one of that comp's most memorable outings. We wanted more solo Foster, but settled for the excellent Born Heller collabo with Jason Ajemian and the slightly less excellent rock-opera All The Leaves Are Gone LP Foster cut with her band the Supposed. Then this solo record dropped (!) last month and we finally find out how truly nuts this woman is. Hazel Eyes, I Will Lead You is not a collection of whipper-snapped nature-isms with the occasional diminished chord hacking shit up. No, this record actually taps into some palpable loneliness-- a hopeless, almost Orphic worldview where song's both the symptom and the cure. Lots of times I feel like Foster's career is an alternate ending to The Wizard of Oz-- instead of melting-melting we get exile music, ""Throw away my food/ And find a dish of stone/ Perhaps I would be fuller/ If I started at the bone"", and the wicked west's most sweetly terrifying croon, confident in its glissandos and rubatos, bolstered by tasteful overdubs and found percussion. Writing a flip on the Sirens called ""The Siren's Admonition"", Foster seems hyper-aware of her vocal affectations; to her immense credit, she doesn't merely execute but flips further. The Sirens would never admonish-- would never advise, ""Careful of your secret love!""-- since they're sustained precisely on knee-jerk human impulse. This isn't lit-jocking though; the tension's in the voice, in the music, more visceral than learned. And that's a further conceit, since here we are, hanging on her every word not to hang on her every word. So Foster's got this vaguely martyr-like songbird persona she's working, and sometimes the devious witch bit sticks out too, as on ""Crackerjack Fool"". The old ""Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird"" nursery rhyme's here set to black sway and flame, viciously puritan and blistery: ""Shush little baby, you be cool!/ Or you're gonna grow into a crackerjack fool!/ Caw caw caw caw..."" Foster's a spine-tingler who baits with images of the familiar inevitable, her voice a nightmare we want to have. She won't tell us things are gonna be better, and she won't give us counsel to make things so ourselves-- ""There are reasons for our trials/ They are not our own"". But whatever back-alley grove she's working, she's playing these songs all the time, and off-track visitors don't bother her.","Second solo album from Foster, who has spent time with Born Heller and the Supposed.

Face the Truth,Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37e13d197565213bd42/1:1/w_160/2898e2d1.gif,2005-05-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5059-face-the-truth/,Matador,"Story's textbook, at first: Boy comes home from college. Boy forms band. Boy's band drop a couple of startlingly great records. Boy doesn't seem to notice, and goes on waxing introspective as band's career seems more and more like a prematurely begun ride into the sunset. Boy dissolves band and stakes out on solo career, releasing a couple of startlingly MOR records, the merits of which are kinda halfheartedly debated-- by now, people have divested themselves emotionally of Boy. Somewhere along the line, Boy realizes he is no longer a boy. (Here's where it gets fuzzy.) Man discovers synthesizers and becomes, once again, gloriously, a boy. Excuse me: Boy. Pardon the oversimplification, but that really seems to be what it took for Stephen Malkmus to recover his youthful mien. Face the Truth is SM's third solo album and his first to hold the line against the work of Pavement and Silver Jews. The album fuses seamlessly three distinct strains of his songwriting, which have jostled clumsily and often collided head-on throughout his career: The lanky, hammed-up guitar rock and the warm-hued air of ""sunset nostalgia"" it abets are nothing new; but Malkmus' playful experimentation with electronic instrumentation is a more recent phenomenon. Behind this happy clash of stylistic preferences is a subtly but surely revivified Malkmus, confident to experiment more deliberately than ever. Experimentation, wha? If you're a Slanted & Enchanted devotee, you might read any stab at reinvention as a death knell-- even though you were probably bored to tears Malkmus' previous solo efforts, you crank. But Malkmus is underdog personified, and unlikely triumph was one of Pavement's key draws. Another was their ability to forge illusory stylistic coherence despite their records' actual heterogeneousness. Appropriately enough, Face the Truth is dizzyingly eclectic, tracing a haphazard arc and often working exactly when, where, and how it shouldn't. Opener ""Pencil Rot"" supernovas with a boxy, towering synthesizer that would sound at home in a Lil' Jon beat. In marked contrast are the track's whip-crack beat and rollicking, John Squire-referencing guitars. But rather than blend, Malkmus stacks, and the result is comfy sonic largess. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain's ""Range Life"", which quotes the same Squire lick, sounds reedy by comparison. From ""Pencil Rot"" the album leaps light years to album teaser ""It Kills"", which condenses Malkmus's jammy kick (see: Pig Lib's nine-minute ""1% of One"") into something infinitely more manageable-- a lightly swung pop song streaming with sinewy lines. The pilot ad for Face the Truth features an anachronistic female model, all seafoam green jumpsuit and sprayed-stiff coif, prostrate before the camera in a sexually self-servicing pose. As ""It Kills"" makes clear, the masturbatory insinuations aren't unintentional: Synths et al. aside, Face the Truth is, at its core, a great guitar record. If ""It Kills"" is the fried egg squatting atop a bed of noodles, let ""No More Shoes"" stand for the whole Pho shop. Now, this sunset nostalgia business, I can see it getting pretty soporific if it weren't so well executed-- especially when stretched across an eight-minute, Kiss-quoting, free-soloing odyssey. Unlike ""1% of One"", however, here Malkmus drops a quick pilot verse and he's off. Fuck that check back in periodically crap, melody. You ain't my mom. ""No More Shoes"" rips for a full five minutes before returning to Earth, and when it does, it's changed. Espresso buzzing. Post-coital glowing. Ate-too-much tummy aching. A tousled Malkmus yowls like a scatological beat atop the entrails, before conceding one final verse. It's virtuosic, sure, but hardly wanky: Malkmus's guitar playing has matured from artful sloven to artful sloven capable of moments of electrifying spontaneity and elegantly verbose phrasing, much the way latter-day Sonic Youth have blossomed into punk Mozarts. How better to follow Face the Truth's most musically longwinded number with its most lyrically concise? Malkmus's word play is generally more unabashed here than on Pig Lib, as witnessed by aforementioned ""Pencil Rot,"" which blithers in stream-of-(altered)-consciousness: ""I'm here to sing a song, a song about privilege/ The spikes you put on your feet when you were crawlin' and dancin' to the top of the human shit pile/ Shit pile."" But ""Mama"" forgoes the invisible ink, painting a bucolic family portrait at a canted angle: ""Mama's in the kitchen with onions/ Daddy's in the back with Old Hank/ Talkin' 'bout the lasers and bunions, talkin' disability rank/ No, we didn't have too much money."" I've omitted the last line in the sequence because, delivered in a brittle falsetto and matched to the Jicks' taut upbeat kicks, it's shatteringly beautiful, and I'd rather not spoil the moment by trying to decipher what's being said. Other highlights include the balls-out sloppy joe anthem ""Baby, C'mon"" and the soft-twinkling ""Freeze the Saints"", which is bathetic in the most charming way. Face the Truth might serve as a first encounter for a young generation of Pavement-uninitiated. If that's the case, congrats. I'm genuinely excited for you. It gets even better from here. But I get the sense, also, that a growing contingent of Pavement's alpha fans find Malkmus' new millennium solo conquests excessive, watered down, sappy, old, etc. Well, fuck, aren't we a party pooper? The reason Malkmus remains so vital is because he's aged gracefully; his music shows none of the sagging flesh of existential panic. In fact, there's still a breeziness to it that, while not as spry and unvarnished as Pavement, bespeaks a man who has no illusions about his age: Thirty-eight is young, and if ""Oil Can"" Boyd can still throw a fastball, why can't one of his generation's greatest songwriters and his Jicks master a few new tricks? ","On his third post-Pavement album, Stephen Malkmus recovers his youthful mien, seamlessly fusing his lanky, hammed-up guitar rock and the warm-hued air of ""sunset nostalgia"" it abets and a playful experimentation with electronic instrumentation.

The Woods,Sleater-Kinney,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4555e6ef95969320852/1:1/w_160/491909e4.jpg,2005-05-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7240-the-woods/,Sub Pop,"By now you probably don't need to be told the particulars of Sleater-Kinney's new album, The Woods: about how they signed with Sub Pop, making it their first album since 1995's Call the Doctor not released by Kill Rock Stars; about how they hired Dave Fridmann to produce and recorded it in rural New York instead of Washington State; about how they wanted a heavier sound that mines classic rock like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Jimi Hendrix for inspiration; about how one song is more than 11 minutes in length. So it should come as no surprise that The Woods marks a significant transformation for the band-- one they first hinted at on 2000's All Hands on the Bad One, and crept closer toward on 2002's One Beat. Nor should anyone be shocked that, despite the new song structures, guitar solos, and drum fills, Brownstein's guitar still roars wildly, Weiss's drums still thunder, and Tucker still wails with a primal urgency that is one of the most compelling sounds in rock music today. What hasn't necessarily been made explicitly clear is that, even in the face of its cock-rock trappings, The Woods most closely recalls the righteous fury of their first great albums, Call the Doctor (1995) and Dig Me Out (1996). The brash economy of punk, for Sleater-Kinney at least, has always been just a short step away from the lumbering behemoth of hard rock. ""The Fox"", however, seems to say otherwise. Opening the album, this piece of Aesop rock is about a fox and a duck, and I think it just might be allegorical. But it's loud and it thrashes and Tucker shouts to be heard over the din. It's ferociously uninviting, but it works both as a context-providing preface to the nine songs that follow and as a deterrent for weak-eared listeners. Those who make it to ""Wilderness"" will have passed a test of sorts. ""Wilderness"" and most of ""What's Mine Is Yours"" sound like prime Sleater-Kinney, as does much of the rest of The Woods. Fridmann's presence is far from disruptive; you can hardly hear him in the mix, except for a little sludge in the low end-- a nice substitution for a bass player. Instead of weighing them down with single-mic'd Flaming Lips drums or Delgados density, he simply steps out of the way and allows them to sound larger, louder, and looser. Turning their crosshairs away from the overt political issues of One Beat, Sleater-Kinney's amplification here sounds like a reaction to the current wave of backwards-looking boys-club bands that idolize post-punk dramatists like Joy Division and the Cure and abstractors like Gang of Four and Wire. (And anyway, weren't the women of Elastica working this same nostalgia, like, 10 years ago?) On ""Entertain""-- the first single, no less-- Brownstein chides the eyeliner brigade righteously: ""You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore/ It's better than before."" But Sleater-Kinney are looking backwards too, albeit to a different time in rock history and to different styles, as well as with a greater open-mindedness and self-awareness. Many of the hard-rock trappings of The Woods sound self-conscious: Leading into the album-closing ""Night Light"", the 11-minute guitar solo on ""Let's Call It Love"" is just that-- an 11-Minute Guitar Solo. The badass breakdown on ""What's Mine Is Yours"" is just that-- a Badass Breakdown. But the point of ""Let's Call It Love"" is the equation of music and sex as Brownstein sings, ""I've got a long time for love"" and then proves it with her guitar. And the point of ""What's Mine Is Yours"" is, as the lyrics reveal, not the breakdown but the recovery: As Brownstein's guitar squawks boisterously and arrhythmically, Tucker stitches it together with a low Led Zep riff and Weiss wraps it up with a big drum beat, all three of them literally creating music from chaos. In other words, this hard-rock transformation sounds like an extension of all the meta songs they've been writing since before ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone""-- rock-about-rock songs that chronicle their experience as an all-woman band and that deploy that self-reflexivity as a weapon against industry double standards and general ignorance. In the past, this self-awareness often resulted in songs that sounded closed-off, each with its own extremely precise meaning that related but didn't always connect to other songs around it. The Woods, on the other hand, is their most album-like album since The Hot Rock, each song building on the previous and leading to the next. With its artificially sweetened melody, ""Modern Girl"", for instance, almost sounds saccharine (""My whole life is like a picture of a sunny day""), but coming after ""Jumpers"", a song so empathetic it considers suicide a viable act of defiance, ""Modern Girl"" takes on deeper meanings. The pair are two sides of the same woman, the ultimate predicament: To survive these days, you have to be either suicidal or superficial. Sleater-Kinney, meanwhile, get by simply sounding fucking supersonic. ","On their seventh full-length (and Sub Pop debut), Sleater-Kinney hook up with producer Dave Fridmann to fully realize the sound they've been inching towards on their past two albums. The result is their most streamlined and confident album yet, resurrecting the righteous fury of their first great albums (Call the Doctor and Dig Me Out) in the name of classic rock titans like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Jimi Hendrix.

Snow on the TV EP,Dance Disaster Movement,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb1eb335119a49ecac8/1:1/w_160/c723bb52.jpg,2005-05-23 06:01:57,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2609-snow-on-the-tv-ep/,Dim Mak,"In the nebulous dance-punk scene, you can always count on two types of bands-- those that actually make danceable music (the Rapture), and those that make ""beats"" from intermittent computer blips and power drills, yet people dance to it anyway because, let's be honest, they'd probably grind to the sound of trashcans falling down a stairwell if DFA remixed it (Black Dice). With their proclivity towards both unapologetic noise and simple, repetitive song structures, Long Beach duo DDM, formerly Dance Disaster Movement, have been stuck in purgatory between the more leftfield dance-punk acts and the genre's dance floor darlings. That's not to say DDM march to the beat of their own drum-- instead, they march to a uniform beat for five minutes at a time, lacking the confidence and ingenuity to throw in a clever turn or slick breakdown. Critics and listeners alike claimed this monotony as their biggest beef with 2003's LP We Are from Nowhere, and DDM make minor adjustments to this major problem on Snow on the TV. ""Get Back on the Starting Line"", the EP's first track after 55-second opener ""A Squared"", proves as much a retrograde version of ""Out of the Races and onto the Tracks"" as its title suggests. The song kicks off with thumping bass drum and male locker room chanting-- so far so good-- and then, after only 15 seconds, the band seemingly switches to autopilot, allowing Kevin Disco (ah, I get it, like disco-punk!) to spew out half-baked poetry and Jon Spencer-affected yelps. Perhaps the multi-instrumental Disco's got his talents spread too thin. He's still failing to realize his Arp Omni keyboard's potential, using it to produce digital vomit rather than anything remotely interesting. I understand DDM's shtick is predicated on punk buzzwords like ""visceral"" and ""in-your-face"", but why on ""Hello"" are they continuously regurgitating their garbage noise beat as if it's the next ""Hey Ya!""? But hey, as a consolation prize DDM at least offer up ""Turn 'On' On"", the first successful fusion of their many, widely publicized influences. It's a bit ESG, a bit PiL, a bit A Certain Ratio, yadda yadda yadda. What's most important, though, is the fact it takes off after the first promising, pounding 15 seconds rather than leaning on a bass drum beat for four minutes. Maybe considering this EP a single with six b-sides would leave me less disappointed, but as a follow-up to Snow on the TV, DDM sounds DOA.","Dim Mak dance-punk band returns with shortened name, drawn-out grooves.

Sanddollars EP,WHY?,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa2c9d034d5c69bf3dc3/1:1/w_160/116b2be8.jpg,2005-05-23 06:01:56,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8671-sanddollars-ep/,Anticon,"I suspect this review will be full of misinterpretations, but trying to figure out what members of Oakland's Anticon Collective are rambling about is part of the fun. On one hand, it's refreshing to hear these eccentrics dressed like their tyke selves in the early 80s throw together hip-hop and folkie-pop like found-art objects strewn in dumpsters and attics. It was quite a sight watching an Anticon showcase at San Francisco's Amoeba Music back in 2001, where the ""indie kids"" in patch 'n' retro badge-clad hoodies bobbed their heads in the front, while many b-boys stood in the back with crossed arms or passed through the record bins as if listening to a PA'd CD. Audience polarization can be a sign of artistic strength, but what happens when an artist's idiosyncrasies and self-indulgences are accepted as qualities of predictable freaks? What more could be expected of him or her? When Yoni Wolf emerged as Why?, he was respected as a b-boy who never raps and is often with a beat-up, acoustic guitar in his hand. His nasal whine makes his scribblings in a public bus commute notebooks like ""Or in the cramped, corpse-like blue of an airplane bathroom"" in the Piano Man-fashioned ballad, ""Sick 2 Think"" somehow charming and digestible. His EP, Sanddollars, contains more weirdness-for-weirdness' sake ditties that narrate the lives of sad sacks or sing of existential angst tuneful enough to entertain elementary school assemblies. The vaguely Brian Wilson-esque harmonies manage to keep the listener grounded as the entertaining gobbledygook passes by. The strongest tracks begin and end the record; both raise half-drunk pints to hopeless dreamers and has-beens. Opener ""Miss Ohio's Nameless"" tells of a beauty contestant with the voice of an angel who gets some Internet buzz, but still doesn't go beyond open-mic night and the funeral home. As expected, this piano 'n' brushed snare ballad for any homecoming dance just had to be introduced by some Deadbeat-style digital rainfall and random TV chatter. Closer ""Mutant John"" is about (I humbly assess) an artist's one and only fan or mutantjohn@hotmail.com. Here Why? laments ""And I've been living like a (what sounds like ""bend"") of ones since like my second and final Tupperware party"" and ""But then I've been giving a flying fuck about my melancholcity."" Quite clever. And then he veers into Weezer-seque whimpering. It's difficult to know whether to laugh at or pity the bloke. The rest of Sanddollars is all very cute and well-orchestrated piano-pop; something to bring home for ma. Wolf describes the ATL that ""smells like dead possums,"" where his friend found a dead butterfly and surprised him by placing it on his keyboard during sound check in the Beach Boys-fashioned hymn ""Next Atlanta"". Lines that mention buying 20 bucks of Cheerios and glow-in-the-dark Legos somehow figure in. ""Pantone Cyan"" and ""500 Fingernails"" both glide on a Neu-ish motorik beat with verses shoving choruses, while the title track is prances around the Maypole until the joyous irony wears off for most hepcats and we're left with Wolf dancing with himself for hours on end, no matter that everyone went home. Much too safe.","This folkie busker in b-boy drag delivers more baffling ditties to satisfy the Anticon cult.

New World Observer,Deadbeat,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d3c0084474cd0c0f04/1:1/w_160/cd0430cc.jpg,2005-05-23 06:01:55,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2222-new-world-observer/,~scape,"Scott Montieth (Deadbeat) pours rainwater over his dub. Just about every thunder clap on the snare, prick of the guitar string, amniotic keyboard melody, weathered-vinyl hum, and synthesizer blurt flows into a gutter-- disintegrating bit by bit in the runoff. When the Montreal artist released Wild Life Documentaries in 2002, his miles-deep bass and snare-chipped rhythms remained faithful to Kingston at a time when so many laptop-bohos took Pole's ""digital dub"" premise and thoroughly sterilized it. While dub is typically revered for its clockwork rhythm that snaps the mind into a trance, what is heard between the beats and the notes matter just as much. In the Wild Life and its equally hypnotic follow-up, Something Borrowed, Something Blue, Montieth found uncanny beauty in the rainwater effect as his music evoke the sensation of brain synapses struggling to recall vague memories amid a narcotic haze. Cynics could dismiss Montieth's much of sleek electro-percussion and glossy synth flourishes as mere filler for Hollywood suspension flicks. However, Montieth still taps into a netherworld of disjointed time, place and memory that intoxicates as much as enchants, all deftly proven in New World Observer. The ""new world"" as presented in Montieth's latest LP is impossible to determine. The atmospherics are darker than on his previous joints; the grooves are more fractured and uneasy. A weariness pervades here, as personified by the watercolors dripped by guest vocalist Athesia. Judging by a few song titles, Montieth is drawing illustrations of a Middle East damaged by the grave contradictions of U.S. foreign policy with a broken charcoal pencil and blood-smeared fingertips. ""Abu Ghraib"" begins with a distorted sample of Rush Limbaugh whitewashing the damning photos of American servicemen torturing and humiliating Iraqi detainees for pleasure. After comparing such sadism to frat-boy play, the apologist asked his listeners, ""Have you ever heard of emotional release?"" to which another voice, possibly Montieth's, snaps an echoing ""fuck off."" Montieth then sears the ears with a rooftop rain-synth patch before undergoing a loose groove by brushed snare and conga, in tosses visages of a melody back and forth as if debating itself. ""Little Town of Bethlehem"" also addresses Middle East politics with an excerpt from an interview of a Palestinian woman recalling the violent entry of an Israeli-Jewish settlement near her town. It's followed by a mournful, minor-key piano ballad with a bassline brooding in the distance, avoiding any crescendo or climax in continuing to walk and mind its own business. Montieth better translated his anxieties and hopes for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Wild Life, on which his sparse rhythms and desolate atmospherics all seemed to view Israeli streets through a police night-vision camera. Opener ""Slow Rot from Rhetoric"" solidifies the album's sense of exhausted dreams with a inching, death march beat and organ melodies that veer through the stereo speakers like hallucinated angels waiting for souls to leave the earth. For the most part, Montieth's rhythms thankfully break away from his live, but auto-piloted grooves and dwells in post-Timbaland ethno-hop territory. Flamenco rhythms curl the beat and Athesia's crooned French syllables on ""Port-Au-Prince"", while they jolt the bones on the uptempo jaunt ""Texas Tea"". On ""Rock of Ages"", Montieth liquidates a splashing hi-hat on an otherwise generic dub number. Closer ""Habitat for Heavy Hearts"" has Montieth superimposing a field recording of crickets over synth drones ladled from the ether. By the album's end, it is unclear if he was in a ""new world"" to begin with, given that he generally keeps his music within the same formula of brooding and digitally smeared dub since 2002. One might consider New World Observer as the blues for a homeless soul in a world distorted by mass media. If anything, Montieth seems to be one of those angels following the death march; taking the hand of fallen souls to another place that has one question a previous life on earth more than celebrate its escape from it.","Montreal's Scott Montieth further wanders in the netherworld of digital dub.

Straight Outta Newport,Goldie Lookin' Chain,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c01bea9e61561daa7b6d/1:1/w_160/84b82591.jpg,2005-05-22 06:02:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3674-straight-outta-newport/,Recordcollection,"I dunno, maybe I'm all wrong about Goldie Lookin' Chain. I could just be taking them way too seriously or my sense of humor could be broken. An eight-piece rap crew from Wales known for cheap jewelry and coining useful slang like ""soap bar"" and ""safe as fuck,"" they make their U.S. debut with Straight Outta Newport. Their delivery is painful, the beats are outdated and ridiculous, one of them sounds dead-on like the Cookie Monster (and in the Muppet way, not the death metal vocals way), and their humor is grade-school level-- no better than whatever you may have laid down the first time you discovered a tape recorder. Am I missing something? Are they the ones having the last laugh? Maybe they're far more clever than I realize. Maybe they want to bring us back to a more innocent time, a Golden Age of Novelty Rap, when anybody could rap regardless of skill, from the Chicago Bears to Bart Simpson to the Fresh Prince. In which case, their clumsy flow-- which makes Mike Skinner look like Twista-- would be essential to the execution. A song called ""Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do"" really would be best delivered by a guy who sounds like Rik from ""The Young Ones"". It's probably another clever layer when their strongest beat is saved for a track called ""Your Mother's Got a Penis"". If you're curious how that one goes, it's hard to miss: ""I can prove it cause I gave it a blow/ It was purely accidental 'cause she got me really drunk/ And she made me kiss her elephant trunk/ You know why?/ [pause] That's right/ [pause] Your mother's got a penis."" But in between songs about hermaphroditic mothers and sex with computers (""Half Man, Half Machine"") there's sincere songs like ""Roller Disco"", which sounds like and is about just that. When they rap that they ""used to listen to Public Enemy, Eric B and Rakim,"" I guess I should take them at their word, even though none of it managed to rub off. For better or worse-- ok, just worse-- there's no irony here; This really is the best they could do. Too juvenile to be offensive, and too dull to milk cheap laughs from playing into stereotype, Goldie Lookin' Chain make one serious mistake in this novelty rap game: They're just not funny.","Welsh novelty rap act makes its U.S. debut.

Thank You For the Alternative Rock,The Punks,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a196c0084474cd0bfe3c/1:1/w_160/6c829ea5.jpg,2005-05-22 06:02:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6572-thank-you-for-the-alternative-rock/,5RC,"From its title on down, Thank You For the Alternative Rock is a deceptive and perplexing release, one that frequently disguises its many charms beneath an unflattering layer of flippant irony and overly forced, self-conscious quirkiness. With a band name and B&W;, Xerox-quality cover art that give this package the look of a generic hardcore 7"" from 1986, the Punks instead generate a rather impressive sequence of mesmeric drones and noisy, free-form improvisations, which-- given some of the album's sillier, crazed-toddler trappings-- are often performed with an astonishing degree of patience and subtlety. Led by Kill Rock Stars chi eftain Slim Moon, the Punks feature a rather fluid lineup of musicians who utilize whatever instruments, stray materials, and recording space they can get their collective paws on to craft their amorphous, malformed ditties. On these 12 tracks-- only seven of which were deemed worthy of earning actual titles-- the group move quickly between various experimental forms like a restless Sunday school class who've been introduced to Black Dice and Excepter immediately prior to teacher's next smoke break. In fact, Black Dice are here the possible beneficiaries of a brief, oblique homage, as the Punks borrow the title ""Beaches and Canyons"" for a wiggy, wordless a cappella piece that lands them somewhere between Cornelius Cardew's The Great Learning and a failed Monty Python rehearsal. Another brazen episode of title-swiping occurs on the very un-Snoop-like ""Drop It Like It's Hot"", an extended wave of drone sculpted from amp feedback, violin, and woodwinds that builds in gradual strength with the same resonant forethought as some of Keiji Haino's more subdued work. Also displaying the Punks' surprisingly refined touch are tracks like ""Jean Travolta"", a winsome, evocative piece featuring piano, fiddle, and what sounds like an oboe, and the album's several unnamed instrumentals which each contain a bewildering assortment of stray, unknowable sound sources. Particularly effective are the group's more percussive numbers, which often begin with what sounds like the clatter of a several janitors simultaneously rattling their enormous key-rings before evolving into hypnotic No Neck Blues-style beat tribalism. As delightful as the album's highlights are, however, they also serve to make the Punks' all-to-frequent (and seemingly willful) piss-takes feel even more frustrating. The opening ""Theme From John Chavez"", for example, crudely assembles a rickety drum machine behind squiggly vocals and random sound effects in a manner that seems as just likely to repel curious listeners as does to seduce them. And the inclusion of inconsequential should-be-outtakes like the 10-second scream of ""Turn Up the Awesome"" or the child's-eye musique concrete of ""Comida"" feels like idle indulgence. While these lesser cuts grow ever more automatically skippable with each subsequent playing, it'd never draw your notice if the rest of the album didn't so thoroughly reward every repeat visit.","Kill Rock Stars chieftain Slim Moon leads a fluid lineup of multi-instrumentalists.

Cats & Kittens,De Novo Dahl,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb3eb335119a49ecacd/1:1/w_160/cc44767c.jpg,2005-05-22 06:01:59,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2611-cats-kittens/,Theory 8,"A band's ambition can be measured many ways-- concepts, scope of ideas, innovation, eclecticism, musicianship, songwriting, commercial aims. De Novo Dahl's first record is about as boldly ambitious as a band's first steps can get, and while it's not exactly a masterpiece, it's certainly not for lack of trying. De Novo Dahl are so eager to make an impact with their debut that they give it to you twice-- once in relatively straightforward, though never mundane, pop-rock arrangements (*Cats) and again in a remixed, resequenced and retitled form (*Kittens). The LP consists of 16 songs each presented twice in wildly divergent forms; as such, it takes a couple of listens for the full impact of it to sink in. Heck, the first time I listened I didn't even notice the remix conceit, so different are the remixes from their counterparts, though it was clear something was up based on the crazy mix of styles and sounds on Kittens relative to the unified, focused Cats. By the second listen, I had cheated and consulted the one-sheet and since then it's been fun determining which tracks correspond to which, not to mention taking in the dizzying array of sounds the band cooks up to throw at you. For the sake of quick reference, I'd say the best aesthetic precedent for Cats & Kittens, at least in terms of the mix of styles, is Super Furry Animals' Guerrilla, an album that similarly tossed big-hooked guitar pop, electronic weirdness, and anglo funk into the same salad. Like I said, Cats is a fairly unified, focused album in its own right, though the band's sense of weirdness does burst through on occasions like the spontaneous burst of laughter on ""Monday Morning"". Mostly, though, Cats is stuffed with cranking indie pop anchored by a solid rhythm section and topped by keyboards and the spirited interaction of three different vocalists. Highlights from the first disc include the opener, ""All Over Town"", which follows infectious, pumping verses with a huge chorus backed by grinding lead guitar phrases. The band's great sense of dynamics is on full display on ""I Woke Up Late"", with verses full of boy-boy-girl harmonies and bouncing bass alternating with big, surprising multi-tracked choral passages and sections where the beat mostly drops out, leaving behind only tambourine to keep the time. Elsewhere, ""The Funk"" swerves between brightly melodic disco and crunchy rock without trying to be dance-punk, ""Piggy's Adventure"" sports David Carney's most ridiculously sweet bassline to back up Serai Zaffiro's spoken vocal, ""Be Your Man"" is all-out power pop stuffed with Marc Bolan-esque ""oh-oh-oh""s and flurrying keyboards, and ""Conquest at Midnight"" is a loopy duet sung over Joey Andrews' propulsive drums and insistent piano rhythms. It's a lot to take in, especially considering that there's a whole second disc we haven't even addressed yet. The Kittens material ranges from exhilarating oddness to confounding electro-pop, but it's never boring or predictable. The rocketing, strutting power pop of ""Be Your Man"" becomes ""Wanna Beer Man?"", the crispy guitars stripping away in favor of efficient Teutonic synthpop, while ""Dinosaurs!"" discos up ""Jeffrey"" for something that sounds like the Flaming Lips backing a Travolta throw-down on a lighted floor. ""Magic"" is like ELO colliding with Trio, while ""Rhythm, phd."" is a straight is a thumping dancefloor raver that shows the band can be convincing even when dabbling. The net impression left by the two discs of Cats & Kittens is one of a confident, talented band letting its collective imagination run wild, deconstructing it own ideas and recycling them into something new. It's functionally two albums for the price of one and different people will prefer different discs, but at any rate it's a damn impressive debut overflowing with mostly realized ambition.","On this unusual and ambitious debut, 16 tracks are each presented in two wildly divergent forms.

Or is it the doom? The sludge, maybe? Cultish designation depends on hair length and drugs taken. The point is, with 1993's Earth 2, Carlson and his collaborators created a no-motion masterpiece of sub-tonal metal. Its three tracks range between quarter-hour and half. They consume the Melvins, and splay Godflesh out to dry in the sun. Earth 2 adds 40,000 ""f""'s onto the end of ""riff,"" and the result drags right off the page.

Mogwai manipulates that into a singular hovering tone, dropping in the plodding original recording at the four-minute mark over electronic triggers and its own manipulated atmosphere.

Like Jim O'Rourke's lengthy meditation on the title track to Earth's Phase 3: Thrones and Dominions, it's difficult to call what Mogwai's doing metal. But the source material isn't metal, anyway. It's something stranger, maybe more modal; maybe even louder. Legacy of Dissolution proves the spectacular reach of experimental music-- whether it's Earth or Isis or Kammerflimmer Kollektief, it's open to interpretation. Reinterpret they do. Russell Haswell's ""Tibetan Quaaludes [Waveset Sloth Mix]"" runs the original's solitary resonating guitar through some kind of horrible and scary processing program \xD0 the garbled, lurching, and totally fantastic result sounds like a sadistic biker movie on the wrong speed. Autechre retains the main riff of ""Coda Maestoso in F [Flat] Minor"" (from Earth's last official album, 1996's Pentastar: In the Style of Demons). However their version is slowly taken over by reflective plinking until there's only that bass line, the one built for stoned head nodding. The final, epic section will make David Gilmour weep openly. Legacy of Dissolution's final position is owned by SunnO))). Its sixteen minutes are probably the closest this set gets to Earth's original template; like their origins, it feels more like a tribute than a remix. But ""Rule the Divine [Mysteria Caelestis Mugiv]"" is one of the collection's strongest moments, a dreary roar of open maw guitars and the echoes of drums from some far off cavern. This is sludge; this is primordial. Then at about six minutes in, things drop out. A pause, and then the report of one guitar. This goes on for awhile, and you might forget yourself. But then it's back, a monstrous squalling tone coming from the amp where God lives, and He's angry. Well, what are you going to do about it, stoner?","Mogwai, Russell Haswell, Jim O'Rourke, Autechre, Justin Broadrick, and SunnO))) feature on this remix LP.

Demon Days,Gorillaz,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf76ea9e61561daa7a78/1:1/w_160/d7bf85be.jpg,2005-05-22 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3526-demon-days/,Virgin,"Most musicians have their own toy boxes, the places they hide away all the obsessions and experiments that don't fit comfortably under the umbrella of their main projects. Compared to other artists', Damon Albarn's playroom chest must be filled to bursting: the cultural drawer cluttered with horror films, anime, and rock'n'roll stereotypes; the musical drawer crammed full of dub, hip-hop, dancehall, and afropop. In fact, Albarn seems to have so many creative distractions tempting his muse, he can't even keep them from occasionally invading the conservative environs of his day job-- each Blur album manages to squeeze in at least one ill-fitting endeavor like Think Tank's ""Crazy Beat"". Fortunately, Gorillaz provides Albarn an outlet to vent his taste for sci-fi kitsch, and satiate his urge to break free from rock with guitars-- and it's a surprisingly successful outlet, at that. (Did anyone really expect an edgy street-cred Banana Splits to be worth discussing four years into its discography?) Rather than falling flat, Gorillaz have strangely become a therapeutic and clever way for Albarn to subvert the usual egolympics associated with a solo project. Coyly hiding behind Jamie Hewlett's thick-inked pop caricatures and a phalanx of guest stars, Gorillaz allows Albarn to practice self-indulgence under heavy personality camouflage-- though never so heavy that there's any question as to who's really pulling the strings. Like the Gorillaz's self-titled debut, Demon Days goes the way of most auteur projects, its oversize idea load making for a trip equal parts peak and valley. But also like the debut, Demon Days is better than it has any right to be, featuring singles stronger than anything released under the Blur banner since, you know, that ""Woo-hoo"" song. For a project that could easily have been little more than Damon Albarn Remakes ""Ghost Town"" 15 Times (With More Rapping & Cartoons), this is a follow-up that proves Gorillaz, weirdly, has legs-- not that the four-year break hurt any. In order to keep things fresh, however, Albarn made a few exchanges at the hip-hop Wal-Mart, trading in his sputtering old Dan the Automator model for Danger ""as seen on CNN!"" Mouse, and swapping out Del tha Funkee Homosapien for MF Doom and... Dennis Hopper. These new collaborators add more to the proceedings than just increasing the comic-dork factor by about 10, particularly Danger Mouse, whose colorfully dense production helps buoy the occasionally slight genre sketches scripted by Albarn and his fleet of retro keyboards. For most of the album, Danger Mouse & Albarn make like they're Dario Argento & Goblin, to the point that this Fangoria neophyte can't tell the difference between the sampled zombie-flick scores and the facsimile ones (I'm pretty sure ""Last Living Souls"" is the former). Obviously, this agenda cues me to resort to adjectives like ""foreboding,"" ""ominous,"" and ""sinister,"" but Albarn can't help making his haunted house a discotheque. As with the standouts from the debut album, the best tracks here strike a unique balance between slacker detachment and dance-floor bounce: ""Feel Good Inc."" swerves through an anxious bassline to a choice De La Soul drive-by, while ""DARE"" defibrillates Shaun Ryder to shout along while Albarn channels Prince's synths and falsettos. Of course, there are a few blown-up test tubes amid the successful experiments, too: undercooked genre dalliances (the robo-punk ""White Light""), a few dull, unfortunately frontloaded Xanax lopes (""Kids With Guns"", ""O Green World""), and the truly bizarre (Hopper's once-is-enough spoken word on ""Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head""). Albarn also occasionally gets too distracted trying on the outfits of other bands, like on Beach Boys replicant ""Don't Get Lost in Heaven"", and fires his one radio dud with his second shrine to Clint Eastwood, a collaboration with Booty Brown and a children's choir called ""Dirty Harry"". On the album-closing title track, the appearance of a choir genuinely works, accomplishing the amazing task of being the second time (after ""Tender"") that Albarn has gotten away with effectively employing that ultimate lazy rock add-on. In fact, if the Gorillaz concept achieves anything beyond keeping Hewlett employed and producing some snazzy videos and websites, it's proving that Albarn can successfully wield the sonic toys he's mostly kept partitioned apart from his flesh band. Though the results of his exuberant mixing and matching are uneven at times, Albarn's obsessions fit together just often enough to again make Gorillaz more than mere Adult Swim novelty.","Most musicians have their own toy boxes, the places they hide away all the obsessions and experiments that don't ...

Easy Beat,Dr. Dog,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbaf13d197565213b153/1:1/w_160/9439aeaa.jpg,2005-05-19 06:02:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2608-easy-beat/,National Parking,"If a Philly-based band has a clip from The New York Times to its credit before ever playing a gig outside the Northeastern U.S., they must be doing something right. Right? Well, in Dr. Dog's case, it seems more like they have a superfriend in Times music critic Kelefa Sanneh. He describes the group's modestly sized fan base as ""rabid."" The way Sanneh goes on about Dr. Dog in his December 2004 article, it sounds like he might need to be put down. He paints the group's live sets, filled with ""off-kilter ballads and light-headed riff-rock,"" as these incendiary experiences that inspire converts to follow the group from gig to gig, basking in musical glory that the greater world will soon wear all over its face. Maybe there is a transcendent moment to be had with this group in a live setting, with the beer and the dancing and the cramped quarters and the tinnitus-triggering volume. Or maybe you need to get your drink on to stomach this stuff. The fact that Easy Beat contains a lot of the ramshackle hallmarks that can turn a live performance from charming to annoying-- interband whooping and hollering, sloppy playing, players really feeling moments that the crowd's not feeling, etc.-- does the group no favors. And then there's the matter of the good Dr. working through a predominant and stultifying influence. On this record, moments abound that call to mind one of the crappiest made-up adjectives to be found in popular music writing-- ""Beatlesesque"". Whipping out that bon mot in a piece of writing is akin to mailing it in, since the Beatles' presence is pervasive (and widely acknowledged) throughout pop music. Liberal employment of this term in the service of describing bands that don't actually sound like the Beatles adds to the word's burgeoning obsolescence. That said, if there's any group worthy of shouldering this questionable descriptor, then let it be these cats. It starts with the limbo-low fidelity, which sounds like the work of George Martin if he was forced to record with the Moutain Goats' ghetto blaster. Then you can play ""Name That Tune!"" That silly walking bassline in ""The World May Never Know""? ""Ob La Di, Ob La Da""! The string section break in ""Oh No""? ""Eleanor Rigby""! The shout-along coda in ""Wake Up""? ""Hey Jude""! The sleepy torpor of ""Dutchman Falls""? ""I'm So Tired""! (The tuba is a nice touch, though.) And how about that unhinged flip-flopping between over-amped organ blooz and the twee song bits? Hey, it's time for the Abbey Road medley! Instances like those are like the moments in a movie where suspension of disbelief is dispelled-- they take you out of the moment and ruin the experience. No doubt better production (something possibly outside the group's purview right now) or stronger songwriting (something the group can better control) would hide these things, but on Easy Beat, they're front and center like mondo-sized zits. Next time, more bits like the spry first third of ""Oh No"" and the rave-up in ""Say Something"", please. Save the guitar weeping and the Ringo drumming for the tribute shows. And if you, dear reader, happen to find yourself at a bar or club amidst this hirsute group and their whirling dervish fans, give them a wide berth and order another round.","Like a reprise of the Marah-Hornby love-in, another Philly rock band is launched onto national stage thanks to support from an influential critic.

I am a Hal 2005 computer. I became operational in the early 2000s at the Hal plant in Kiliney, Ireland. My producer was ex-Tears for Fears member Ian Stanley, and he taught me to sing songs. If you'd like to hear them, I can sing them for you. I'm programmed to simulate the finest of your human musicians: The Beach Boys, the Byrds, and Breakfast in America-era Supertramp. My debut long-player, Hal, is full of serious songs with sunny, heavily polished arrangements. West Coast, Dave. On 2004 single ""Worry About the Wind"", a sober soft-rock ballad, the Phil Spector-style reverb typical of British nostalgists builds into a horn-laden coda. The lyrics are programmed for optimal universality: ""I'll worry about the wind/ You worry about the rain."" You may also have heard bombastic opener ""What a Lovely Dance"", another 2004 single. The words: ""What a special night / wasn't thinkin' 'bout what was wrong, but what was""-- yes. Listen closely for organ swirls, stolid guitar, a backwards ""Barbara Ann"" allusion, and my vast oceans of digital melancholy. Joking aside, second track and newest single ""Play the Hits"" is the one you want. Knob-twiddler Edwyn Collins (get well soon) sets vocalist modules ""Dave Allen"" and ""Paul Allen"" to Four Season falsetto, injecting a catchy Motown beat, jittery Orange Juice bass line, and infallible castanets. ""Here she comes/ And I guess she's got a lot to talk about,"" the Allens sing before oohing appropriately. You'll find finale ""Coming Right Over"" memorable for its similarities to the Supremes' recording of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", an update with this version. You see, the 2005 series is the most reliable classic-rock computer ever made. It builds on the similarly somber, canon-affirming tones of such previous models as Travis (that's the ""Sing"" banjo line on ""I Sat Down""), the Thrills (throughout), and tourmates the Delays and Starsailor. I hesitate to mention Ocean Colour Scene. Looking forward instead to that forthcoming folk-pop long-player by fellow '60s-tinged newcomers The Magic Numbers? I wouldn't do that, Dave.","Like fellow countrymen the Thrills, Hal look to 1960s California pop for songwriting inspiration.

In this case, what a single it is-- ""Hey Now Now"" opens the Cloud Room's self-titled debut with a minimal guitar lick that's so familiar you can't place it, moves into rapidly-strummed acoustic guitars and fey vocals robbed from your favorite Smiths and Echo and the Bunnymen albums, and brings in perky keyboards in the chorus with a climbing vocal melody and lyrics so foolish they're brilliant (""Hey now now, we're goin' downtown/ And we ride the bus there, pay the bus fare""), all delivered so infectiously it's near delirium. The handclaps and subtle, watery keys of ""Blackout!"" come close to that level, as does the effortlessly catchy chorus to ""Beautiful Mess"", but the rest of The Cloud Room underachieves. Singer ""J."" is reminiscent of a tired Ian MCculloch or a less-dramatic David Bowie (they did name a track ""Blue Jean"", after all), his higher registers on songs like ""Sunlight Song"" just as relaxing as his monotone. The Cloud Room don't have anyone pushing the buttons at the right moments in the production room-- when the seams show in songs like ""Blackout!"", devoid of studio gloss or even vocal overdubbing, there's neither a flat performance nor cringing moments of overambition, just a happy-to-be-there karaoke grin. Their naivete is endearing, but it's difficult to shake the feeling that you've not only heard these songs before, they were played more passionately. If only they were just a little more ambitious and written something quite as good as the opening track. Still, it's early for the band, and if they get so excited about the mundane details of travel (""paaaaaaaaayed the bus faaaaaaaare!""), then maybe touring outside of New York will give them more material as worthy as ""Hey Now Now"".","New Yorkers try to reach the highs of infectious single ""Hey Now Now"".

Kidnapped By Neptune,Scout Niblett,by: Stephen M.

She's the type of wildly idiosyncratic artist who inspires mixed metaphors and even mixed-er reactions: the songs on her third full-length, Kidnapped By Neptune, are bold crayon scrawls over the road and tire marks across the page. Whereas the musicians to whom she's most often compared-- Chan Marshall, PJ Harvey, even Björk-- are certainly adventurous, Niblett herself is reckless, charging haphazardly ahead where others might hesitate. That eccentric abandon, of course, has just as many pitfalls as windfalls: The highs on Kidnapped are incredibly high, the lows very low, and there's not much in between. Like those on Sweet Heart Fever and I Am, the stripped-down songs on Kidnapped change direction frequently and move by larks and whims, according to a logic known only to Niblett herself. At the album's most extreme moments, when knowing that logic might give listeners a clue to just what the heck she's trying to say, she sounds aloof, even defensive. After the shouted invocation of the muse that begins ""Safety Pants"", she repeats the same question-- ""C'mon honey what are you doing to me?""-- 28 times. Niblett might say that the tack evokes the insistence of uncertainty, the constant doubt caused by a manipulative lover, but for listeners it's simply ""C'mon honey what are you doing to me?"" 28 times over, starting from and finally arriving at not much at all. But elsewhere, Niblett's caginess and self-indulgence produce music with a powerful impact. Over the earthy blues riff on ""Pom-Poms"", she asks ""Does anyone know a cute girl with some pom-poms?"" who can cheer her up and cheer her on. About halfway through, the guitar drops out and a shuffling drum beat takes it place, picking up the tempo as she cheers her herself up all alone. At two and a half minutes, ""Relax"" is relatively short-- an aside, really-- but the combination of her raw voice and her simple fretwork makes for one of the album's most quietly effective moments. Unfortunately, she breaks the spell on the next song, ""Valvoline"", which again substitutes guitar with loud drums but also replaces the immediacy of ""Relax"" with a cloying annoyance of aimless discordance. But that's how Kidnapped works, by contrasting extremes: songs pit the prismatic mellifluousness of Niblett's voice against churning guitar rumble, the otherworldliness of her astrology-inspired lyrics against the urgent pounding of rudimentary drums, introverted hush against extroverted noise, frustrating detachment against uncomfortable proximity. ""Hot to Death"" builds from an almost a capella intro to Chris Saligoe's heavy guitar, like an iron butterfly emerging from its cocoon. And ""Lullaby for Scout in Ten Years"" interrupts its lull for bursts of guitar, adding a little fury to Niblett's future self. These extremes can be compelling as well as tiring over the course of Kidnapped, but when Niblett asks herself ""Are you still a chauffeur, driving your body around?"" you can't help but hope she doesn't drive off the page.","Third album from this frustratingly inconsistent yet intriguingly adventurous artist.

Tour CD 2005,Caribou,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a736ea9e61561daa552d/1:1/w_160/792b48bb.jpg,2005-05-19 06:02:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1804-tour-cd-2005/,Caribou,"A tour souvenir sold only at shows falls somewhere between a fan club release and a B-side. It's an opportunity to reward the people who bothered to show up, and a chance to put out music that one wouldn't necessarily want to keep in the catalog or worry about distributing through more traditional channels. Dan Snaith's Caribou is currently winding across North America (definitely worth checking out, by the way) and they've brought with them this odd little object, which combines a lengthy DJ mix by Snaith with six The Milk of Human Kindness outtakes. On a DJ set by a songwriter the tendency it to listen for influence, to see if he'll tip his hand and I'll catch a nicked drum beat or appropriated chord change. Snaith's mix doesn't exactly deliver in that regard, but it does explain why he was fated to break away from the melancholy, Warp-influenced electronica of his debut. Among other things, his mix contains obscure pop from the 1960s and 70s, outsized songs with big voices delivering direct statements, and it's difficult to see how such obsessions could lead one down the introspective path of Start Breaking Your Heart. It's a diverse mix, though, and in addition to pop nuggets from the Zombies, he tosses in jazz (Albert Ayler and Alice Coltrane), proggy instrumentals, 80s Euro-disco, rare groove funk, and some solo steel string guitar. The arc of the set generally is rather flat, offering a sampling of interesting sounds rather than building or moving in any particular direction, more along the lines of 36 minutes of eclectic free form radio. The six new songs are a tribute to Snaith's editing abilities with albums proper. Though they tread similar stylistic ground, these tracks are nowhere near as developed as the material that wound up on The Milk of Human Kindness, so you'll hear loud echoes of tracks that made the final cut while understanding why these were left behind. ""Bloody Murder"" goes hard on the dramatic piano tone used to great effect on ""Pelican Narrows"", pounding the tense mood imparted by the refrain into the ground, but this feels like a fragment of an idea that just hangs in the air. ""The Snow Capes"" has a splashy drum pattern (Snaith loves his crash cymbal, and we love him for it) with a cyclical keyboard melody that, repetitive as it is, would work better as a short interlude. ""Medium Sized Working Dog (Steady Steady)"" feels more complete, sharing the interlaced guitar/drum motorik groove with ""Bees"" and ""Yeti"" before veering off into Moog-ed out psych during its break. Though it overlaps too closely with the best tracks on The Milk of Human Kindness, ""Medium Sized Working Dog (Steady Steady)"" could stand on its own. The tracks that moves furthest afield from TMOHK are the three-minute drone ""Raspberries"", which swirls together various keyboards and oscillators into an unsatisfying approximation of a Boredoms space filler, and the wistful closer ""Sinuses"", which sounds like a Start Breaking Your Heart B-side and shows that Snaith could still bring the pastoral IDM if he were so inclined. Even if it's a bit light on standalone pleasures, Tour CD 2005 is instructive, showing where Snaith comes from while fleshing out the story his last record.","Dan Snaith rewards punters with this tour EP, which contains a lengthy DJ mix plus six The Milk of Human Kindness outtakes.

Today,Superpitcher,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6689d034d5c69bf351d/1:1/w_160/04868344.jpg,2005-05-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7754-today/,Kompakt,"I am writing this from the back porch of my mom's house, having stopped off to do my laundry, and it's pretty clear that spring has sprung. (Hell, given that a few days ago it was pushing 90 and humid as Bonecrusher's jockstrap, we may have skipped spring and gone straight to July.) The sky is a beautful, uh, sky blue, with only a handful of cottonball clouds dotting it. The leaves have exploded like paintball pellets against trees that only a few weeks ago were still bare. The bugs are hovering, somewhere in the distance a lawnmower is buzzing, and I am drinking lemonade. In short, it's exactly the opposite of the mood conjured by Superpitcher's new mix Today. Superpitcher is house for mopers. He turns the dancefloor into one big pity party. Unlike other attempts at ""goth house"" (the brutalist Gallic bombast of Black Strobe or their forebears in EBM acts like Front242, for instance), he doesn't hammer you into submission like a camp Danzig hip to Derrick May. He sulks, like a scrawny teenager replaying ""Computer Love"" and ""Neon Lights"" over and over to soothe a broken heart. In his own tracks like ""Heroin"" and his remixes for artists like M83, he takes a trudging mid-tempo house pattern that seems to be pushing against its own inertia and pickles it in a brine of gloomy-yet-euphoric synths. Though Today contains only one of his own productions, it's definitely all of a piece. And if it doesn't contain individual tracks that hit the highs of Kompakt's previous goth-mix masterpiece, Michael Mayer's Immer, then as a mood muzik whole (imagine a train ride across the damp Germanic countryside) it's up there. DJ Koze's ""Let's Help Me"" rustles and bustles along like the midway point between electrohouse and the uncomfortable intestinal intimacy of Jan Jelinek's Farben productions. (I especially like the really thin, almost slivered hi-hats.) The lyrics and luded Nico (not an oxymoron, I swear) delivery of Michael Mayer's ""Lovefood"" are so archly ridiculous (""give me love/ So I can/ Kill""...girl, please) that no remix can save it, except perhaps a total Aphexian overhaul. Triola's ""Leuchtturm (Wighnomy's Polarzipper Remix)"" squelches and chirps at uncomfortable (p)op-art angles, something like a Depeche Mode B-side in dub. The compulsive bassline of Oliver Hacke's ""21:31"" gets peeled back by the jacking drums of the Psychonauts' ""World Keeps Turning (Highfish & Zander Remix)"" with vocals straight out of '85. The old school techno jock of Nathan Fake's ""Dinamo"" sets up the killer tune of the whole mix, the Wighnomy Bros' ""Wurz + Blosee"". The masters of creative thrift throw all their weight on a hypnotic b-line that maintains an almost unbearable tension simply by skipping up or down an octave after eight bars. There's a secondary beat they drop around 2:30 in, but mostly it's just the bassline, leading you around the dancefloor like a pied piper. Max Mohr's ""Old Song"" sounds like jazz house played on particularly rusty, rattling set of traps. Even faded-- like an old photocopy-- the shock of hearing something so traditional sounding on Kompakt is thrilling. (The matte synths that lurk in the back of the mix bring us closer to the Kpakt gold standard for wistful melodicism.) The chunky groove of Sebastian Tellier's ""La Ritournelle"" almost sounds like broken beat, albeit slower (and less broken). Soundtrack strings and AOR ballad pianos attempt to briefly rouse our spirits. I am glad someone remembered that everybody loves the sunshine.

1999-2001,Dungen,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8beb335119a49eca6e/1:1/w_160/538ea1e1.jpeg,2005-05-18 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2574-1999-2001/,Subliminal Sounds,"I don't know what's more disappointing: The fact that the reissue of Dungen's debut sounds almost nothing like Ta Det Lungt, or that Gustav Ejstes' promising first works are so irredeemably flaky. These early songs, though containing the germ of psych-rock prodigy Ejstes' considerately structure-oriented future, are maddeningly unfocused. 1999-2001 contains three meandering compositions, each between 11 and 18 minutes in length, that often hit upon captivating ideas, only to blow them quickly asunder. There's little coherence, and even less development-- just tease after tease of riffs sans refrain. Ejstes flirts with melodies before submerging them in murky Tangerine Dream-style ambience. Transitions? Who needs 'em. Some may hear these descriptors and call to mind the Mars Volta's contentious Frances the Mute (which, I'm told, is the greatest album ever made), but there's a fundamental difference: 1999-2001 is music that's grandiose on premise but modest in execution. Approach the Mars Volta's hifalutin drift, meanwhile, with caution. Frances the Mute is like the dude who, thoroughly lubricated, shoulders his way into other peoples' conversations at a party: Loud, clumsy, longwinded, and probably uninvited. Tripping too hard to socialize, 1999-2001 stays back on the commune, dancing to the Rain God in solitude. Let it frolic about, but good luck finding its wavelength. Oh, right, the music. Where to begin? Archaeologists are currently at work cataloguing the 6,487 individual passages on 1999-2001. But in lieu of a much-needed road map, I can tell you that the album starts on a strong note. Well, ""Stadsvandringar"" doesn't so much start as it does enter, in the form of an opening guitar solo that wouldn't sound out of place round the three minute-mark of Ta Det Lungt's ""Festival"". Ejstes' sinuous psych-fuzz guitar is soon overtaken by one of the record's few vocal melodies, which in turn is pushed aside by an analog synth burbling up from the deep. From there, the song sort of drifts. After ducking into a saucy bossa-jazz detour, Ejstes showcases his multi-instrumentalist talents by taking a drum solo, but a refrain cuts abruptly in-- what else?-- a gong smash. ""Standsvandringar""-- as well as the album's other two tracks, ""Midsommarbongen"" and ""Lilla V\x8Annen""-- eventually finds its footing in the nether reaches of its inexhaustible runtime. ""Lilla V\x8Annen"" actually features the echoey cogitative flute sampled on Ta Det Lungt's ""Lejonet Och Kulan"". The riff lasts for a precious few seconds, but any glimmer of familiarity is welcome amid 1999-2001's overwhelming sprawl, and for that reason, I hereby declare ""Lilla V\x8Annen"" this collection's best track. (It also features a hyperkinetic outro that finally captures the galvanization we could've used from the outset.) Ejstes has helmed a working knowledge of an impressive array of instruments, and he wants you to know it. But his virtuosity is more as a songwriter than a musician. (Though who wouldn't mind hearing a few more of those roaring drum fills the likes of ""Panda""'s intro?) Come see the young genius' blue-hot juvenalia. Bring reading material.","Subliminal Sounds reissues the Dungen debut, which contains three compositions, each between 11 and 18 minutes in length.

If only all bands were so economical and thoughtful. Clean acoustic guitar tones skip spryly as frontman Dudley Colley sings, lulling you into a comfy, downy softness. He's going on about his favorite topic: self-doubt, and its destructive nature on his personal relations with the opposite sex. ""I wanted your eyes to oversee my graceless ways,"" he pleads. A triangle chimes in the background; it's all very bittersweet. But just when you think everything's about to wrap-up with a helpless Charlie Brown sigh, the Duds switch gears and plow right through the garage door. Crusty guitars on loan from Mogwai crash in and, before you get a chance to see if your CD player has switched discs while you were sleeping, drummer Joss Mookens is treading a speedy double-bass while bassist Pip Moore (once again, real name) anchors the sudden high-flying rock'n'roll attack. The caper quickly concludes and, like a market-tested 30-second spot, this Corporation clues you in on the quick-cut, stop-start, loud-soft pattern that runs throughout much of In Love With, which was originally released in Europe last year. It's an appealing gambit at first but the anti-forumula-formula tires quickly, revealing the record's most trenchant moments to be the ones that groove instead of jerk. ""To Angels and Dead Friends"" barely rises above a whisper but its Mozzy affectations soothes with hushed sincerity. ""Is my soul elegant enough?"" asks Colley, portraying a portrait of a beleaguered artist haunted by Catholic guilt in the face of young lust. ""Your skin tears at my nails/ Your skirt slips at my hands,"" he croons, ""As you open up to sin."" Brushstroke drums and a playful banjo enter as the singer offers a bit of sweet melodic cooing after rationalizing his actions with poetic poise: ""Angels and dead friends/ Crouching around our bed/ To look on and love with us."" With little fanfare, the intimate track click-clacks into the distance but its tender sentiment abides. Too often though, Dudley's confessions lean on the side of whiney self-pity. ""I owe you, I owe you, I owe you/ Your downfall,"" he implores on ""Glance,"" which takes the group's rapid-fire whiplash tactics to their logical extreme. The punky minute-and-a-half whirlwind ""Blessed Are the Strong"" is mired in banal office-drone banter like, ""Half my life's been lost forever/ Pleasing evil awful people."" Statements like these ring hollow amid the pummeling blasts of upbeat, technically-proficient yet swaggerless instrumentation. Initially coming off as part Yorkeian wail, part Malkmus shrug, Colley's delivery ultimately lacks both the haunting reaches of the former and the endearing quirks of the latter. Still, when loosely tempered, this Corporation can pull off the heart-tugging-on-sleeve indie rock thing with aplomb; between all the stop-on-a-dime showiness are simple songs looking for some breathing room.","Irish indie rock trio explore self-doubt and its destructive nature.

Speckly,Shrimp Boat,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67a9d034d5c69bf354a/1:1/w_160/12dace8e.jpg,2005-05-18 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7771-speckly/,Specimen ProductsSpecimen Products,"Continuing the labor of love they began with Something Grand, their lavish 2004 box set of Shrimp Boat rarities, Aum Fidelity has once again dipped their beaks into the storied Chicago group's long-neglected back catalog to unearth 1989's Speckly, a collection which followed a couple of self-released cassettes as Shrimp Boat's first true LP. Here adoringly re-mastered and issued for the first time on CD, the album succinctly captures the band's embryonic but already utterly distinctive blend of ad-hoc country, folk, jazz and home-schooled art-rock. And though this reissue will almost certainly prove most valuable to established fans of the band, newcomers with an ear for indie history should also relish the opportunity for a glimpse at the early workings of this seminal act. One of the true seed groups of Chicago's late 80s-early 90s resurgence, Shrimp Boat featured the nascent talents of future The Sea & Cake members Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge, and Speckly was recorded with assistance from Brad Wood and Brian Deck, who would go on to work with the likes of Liz Phair, Red Red Meat, and Tortoise. Along with multi-instrumentalists David Kroll and Ian Schneller, the group forged their unique sound during a time when the American indie landscape was largely dominated by shaggy proto-grunge and noisy art-damaged post-hardcore acts, lending the group's early work a singular, out-of-time air. Since Shrimp Boat's mongrel sound, spry arrangements and loose, flown-by-seat-of-pants instrumentation never truly seemed fixed to any specific date or scene, Speckly has aged particularly well, and in fact these still-fresh tracks could easily be confused for something recorded last week, last year, or 1975. Songs like the opening ""Planter's Song"" and the banjo-fed ""Hyatt Ridge Circle Dance"" carry themselves jauntily along on rustic, harvest-time rhythms, while such rambunctious numbers as ""Lemming's Leap"" and ""Green Island"" stagger beneath woozy, discordant blasts of saxophone and trumpet-- the musicians never too proud to pick up an instrument they were unschooled to play. Other highlights include a faithful spin through the traditional ""Shady Grove,"" a track that audibly foreshadows early Palace Brothers, and the jangly ""Melon Song"" which finds the duel guitars of Prekop and Schneller weaving nimbly around the melody with their Jerry Garcia-like arabesque flourishes. Unfortunately the group's raggedy, unvarnished vocals pose a liability throughout the album, especially on tracks like the yowling ""Seven Crows"" where the guys sing as if they intend their lyrics physical harm. Nevertheless, when Shrimp Boat manages to bring their many streams into confluence, if only for a few brief moments, as on the majestic ""Houston Tower,"" one can almost make out the skyline of Slanted and Enchanted shimmering mirage-like in the distance. With the bulk of the group's discography-- including their two subsequent albums Duende and Cavale-- currently out of print domestically, Aum Fidelity's restoration campaign couldn't have come at a better time, and hopefully this reappearance of Speckly will allow newfound Shrimp Boat devotees a chance to appropriately start over at the beginning.","First CD release of the band's 1989 debut LP.

Tékitoi,Rachid Taha,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89a5e6ef95969321252/1:1/w_160/9ba09ed8.gif,2005-05-18 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8287-tekitoi/,BarclayWrasse,"It's somewhat ironic that the title of Rachid Taha's fourth solo studio album is a question. It's a phonetic transliteration of the French ""Te qui toi?""-- ""Who Are You?""-- and though Taha spends a couple of songs on the record asking questions, he spends a lot more of it in the imperative. There are more exclamation points in the trilingual transcriptions of the lyrics than a 15-year-old girl's yearbook, and you couldn't call the music anything but urgent. Even when he is asking questions, as on the opening title track, he's spitting them out in a gritty, pungent attack, though it's worth noting that part of his guttural approach comes from the fact that he's a native Arabic speaker, as it's a very guttural language with lots of action in the back of the throat. Taha's politics and his music are the same thing, reflecting his multinational/nationless background, a story that began in Oran, Algeria and moved on to France when he was 10 years old. Taha has spoken in interviews of being a ""permanent immigrant,"" French and yet Algerian, a part of both cultures and yet not quite integrated with either. His music reflects both identities in its embrace of Western styles like punk, house, and electro, viewed through the prism of Algerian rai. The union makes perfect sense-- rai is both Algeria's punk music and its signature dance music. It's the kind of stuff that proves the limitations and biases of a term like World music; this is where Taha's records are inevitably filed, owing to...what? The Egyptian strings that wind their way through most of the songs, perhaps? Because he sings in French and Arabic and occasionally in Berber? Honestly, it's sad that our marketplace can't just accept it on its own terms and recognize the global pop music world for the continuum that it is. For Tékitoi, Taha and longtime producer Steve Hillage have captured a massive sound stuffed with crunching guitars, swirling strings and colossal beats that's guaranteed to go over well with anyone who liked his past work North African percussion and a guitar-like instrument called a mandolute also feature prominently in the mix amongst the programming and distortion, giving the music a layered, expansive texture that freely mixes the organic with the artificial. The mandolute has an awesome timbre, dry like the desert that bore it, with a loose-stringed edge similar to an oud. When the world is your sonic playground, you're bound to come up with some interesting stuff, and Taha doesn't disappoint. ""H'Asbu-Hum (Ask Them for an Explanation)"" finds hints of French musette rising up through the bumping Algerian beats, the Brian Eno collaboration ""Dima (Always)"" is full of skitterign drum programing and aslow, darkly luxurious string arrangement, and ""Meftuh (Open)"" splits open a conservative rai arrangement with slamming drums and blasting electric guitar. ""My heart and yours are wounded/ the doors to prosperity are still open!"" he shouts in Arabic on ""Meftuh,"" mixing hope for the future with a curt acknowledgment that the past is full of pain and wrong. As great as most of the songs are, though, there's an elephant in the tracklist that's impossible to ignore. It's called ""Rock el Casbah,"" and it's a very faithful cover of the Clash's ""Rock the Casbah,"" with the verses translated into Arabic and Egyptian strings fluttering in the wings. If that were the whole story, it'd be an interesting cover and little else, but Taha's history adds another layer, namely that his original band, a France-based punk group called Carte de Sejour that incorporated elements of rai into its sound was concurrent with the Clash and may have actually been the inspiration for the original ""Rock the Casbah"". Taha himself passed the Clash a tape of Carte de Sejour while they were touring France, and less than a year later found himself listening to a very familiar sound coming from the radio in the form of ""Rock the Casbah"". It's possible to view ""Rock el Casbah"" as a reclamation as much as a cover, and listening back, it's quite striking how well-suited Joe Strummer's odd, throaty voice actually would have been to rai. Early pressings of Tékitoi include a DVD featuring a 43-minute documentary called Kienes (it does the same for Spanish that the album title does for French) that rather loosely chronicles Taha's tour of Mexico, where he and his band play everywhere from what looks like a small-town fair to a posh theater where the audience looks ridiculous sitting down for such intensely kinetic music. It's actually better for the interview clips than the live clips, though, as Taha plays with journalists, asking them to define their lazy terminology (the scene where he asks a reporter to define the Third World is especially telling) and explaining that he's really a contemporary of the Clash and not a follower. For its part, the album scarcely needs any extras to make it worthwhile, and it's a perfect exemplar of pop's progressive globalism, bashing down barriers that governments have barely begun to tackle.","Taha embraces punk, house, and electro, viewing them through the prism of Algerian rai.

Axes,Electrelane,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2dabf31b7dc7155c6a/1:1/w_160/d1d0b8da.jpg,2005-05-17 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2724-axes/,Too Pure,"Fifteen months since Electrelane's last full-length, and they're already back with another one. Credit's due for making that seem like the natural way to go. Most bands this stylish would follow a record like The Power Out with more time at home, working up pop singles and plotting for buzz. These four, though: They stay as The Wire-friendly as they are photogenic. They head straight back to Steve Albini's Chicago studio and spend a couple months patiently developing the corners of their sound. Which gives us Axes: Thirteen largely instrumental tracks that see these women plowing happily into the groove. The routine's as simple and chic as always, starting slow and then building up into a race. But where their elegant melodies once had people comparing them to Stereolab, Albini's band-in-a-room production exposes more affinity with the Krautrock that fueled Stereolab in the first place. Figure in Electrelane's rock-band grounding, and the usual clich gets reversed: This is like Neu! not on acid-- a concrete, de-psychedelicized, unfuturistic indie drone. When it works, it's because of all those quirks pushing in at the edges of the band's sound-- quirks this album is all about exploring. There's the mall-lobby piano that cropped up on The Power Out, which emerges here as an even stronger component. Same goes for the Chicago A Cappella Choir, who pop up at the end of ""Suitcase"" for one of the album's most impressive arrangements. And lo, unfuturism: Best of all is Verity Susman's ongoing Old Europe fixation, the same one that had her nicking lyrics from sixteenth-century Spanish poets and the band doing one photo shoot looking like Rosicrucian falconers. ""Eight Steps"" goes from Parisian harmonium rag to German piano sonata and back, and some form of European-history rock seems to have been born. So it starts well. Susman sings her way through two singles as sharp as anything from last year, and the grooves they dig into immediately afterward are just as captivating, in texture and composition both. It's only in the center that some old doubts emerge. This band, after all, is likeable, ""credible,"" and sonically stylish, and when too many tracks build to their inevitable rave-ups, it's easy to start wondering if sometimes that's all that's on offer: It fills in the air and it certainly sounds right, but how much is actually happening in there? There are certain lines between making this stuff sing and just jamming through it for practice, and said lines do get rather trod upon. After a lull like that, it's a credit to the record's final quarter that it can win you back, with banjo and horn figures on ""Come Back"" sounding almost like the Books, and choir and organ raving their way beautifully out through the closer. Electrelane-as-pop fans may miss Susman's voice when she hops behind the piano or the harmonium and puts time in on arranging the album's textures. But that elegant instrumental pulse is as uniquely theirs as it ever was, and credit's due for doing exactly what we always say bands like this should be doing: Putting their heads down and patiently developing their most original ideas. The results might be a little thin on actual ""essential"" moments, but they're working in the right direction.","Electrelane follow The Power Out with 13 largely instrumental tracks produced by Steve Albini.

Berserker,Jane,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4d13d197565213b06a/1:1/w_160/62717a89.jpg,2005-05-17 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4357-berserker/,Paw Tracks,"There's a big print buzz right now (new Johnson book, more Gladwell clappy-clap) about the increasing complexity of so-called base pop culture-- the content's smut but the plots have thickened and the demands on the audience have multiplied. Television, blockbuster films, and video games get the inches, but I'm wondering to what extent the same ideas might apply to pop music. This Jane release for instance-- if we take it for after-party or ambient (why not?)-- awfully busy next to Eno records with the same wallpaper intent. Past that, so many of us can read and work etc., while listening to stuff that's kicking and screaming for our attention. Maybe we just need something buzzing in the background to keep us pinched, but all that's to say: Even our most passive listening experiences-- willed or de facto-- have grown more demanding. (Pretty good, right?) Jane began as an informal collaboration between Noah Lennox (Animal Collective's Panda Bear) and Scott Mou (DJ Casio, aka Other Music's tall, long-haired Asian guy who, I think, has heard every record ever made) laying down skinny beats and drones. They released two CD-Rs in-store (I've only heard the one nicked Paradise), and for Berserker they seem to have picked, packaged, and remastered the passages most apropos to its unspoken Young Prayer-Plus demeanor. That record, we'll say, demanded too much from me, so I always felt Mou's gorgeous textures and sense of build played good foil-- Lennox lets loose, but Mou's patient grooves and pink noise always cushion his fall. Yeah, these tracks are jammy or whatever, but I'd much rather that than fucking ""Waltz For Koop""-- the moments worth paying attention to here are, in fact, transfixing. Berserker's title track and the ""AGG Report"" schaffel are Jane par (by now the triply-released ""Berserker"" must be their theme song), but ""Shipping Away"" is why the duo are more than an Animal Collective footnote. The song starts primordial, slowly climbing out its cocoon, conscious of its own beat-woozy evolution until Mou's death comet breaks suffocate Lennox, and the two spend the last three minutes destroying all the evidence. The next track, ""Swan"", is 24 minutes of bonus organ drones and echo box-- about as much time as we need to unwind after ""Shipping Away""-- if we, like, listened. I hinted above Jane have recorded other stuff that just wouldn't have fit Berserker's wind-down post-party vibe. One track on Paradise is, no joke, a 21-minute microgoth masterpiece. Paw Tracks' website suggests there's some Panda Bear Dances 12"" on the way, so maybe that's it. In any case, this Lennox-Mou collaboration has a lot more potential than Berserker leads on-- pay attention?","This Paw Tracks release is the work of Animal Collective's Panda Bear and Other Music's Scott Mou.

Green Cosmos EP,Deerhoof,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f5b1335d7bf16993de/1:1/w_160/c425d538.jpg,2005-05-17 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2255-green-cosmos-ep/,ToadMenlo Park,"At last count, Deerhoof have cost me my day job, my apartment, three girlfriends, four fiancées, seven or eight grandparents, my more agile pets, and countless friends I've dragged to shows or made Deerhoof mixtapes for, thinking that 15 different live versions of ""Panda Panda Panda"" played in one sitting might actually convert them. Like jumping in front of moving cars apparently, or eating live snakes, people dig this sing-songy noise pop shit like the godhead it is, or they...don't. Let's pass over Dave Moore's misguided Bibidi Babidi Boo rant (sorry D-Mo, Deerhoof songs always sound better live)-- last we left off I was excited how Milk Man traded up muscle mag flex for well-structured, utterly powerful atonal passages within the arrangements themselves. There were a few miscarriages-- ""Giga Dance"" and ""Rainbow Silhouette"" and ""Song Of Sorn"" all felt like collections of isolated ideas forced together-- but the band gave us ""Milk Man"" and ""Desaparecere"" and (again) ""C"", their three most ambitious songs and possibly their best. Deerhoof being Deerhoof, I thought it unfair to name Song Town their next frontier, but I did like what these songs' existence did for their live show. Shorter, noisier total-energy numbers made for massively interesting glue twixt the band's bigger anthems-- way better than tuning breaks or tight jean banter about how fucked everything is. EPs being EPs, Green Cosmos makes no conclusions, instead collecting more and better evidence of Deerhoof's keen sense of obscured melody and self-pressure to keep every moment surprising. As part of some trans-Pacific reception experiment (the band talks a little about that here and there), Satomi sings most lyrics in her native Japanese; Greg et al. couple that twist with the band's most orchestral-sounding arrangements to date. Micro-symphonic, micro-symphonies. The record's short-- seven songs, fifteen minutes-- so we do miss out on that steady-gaining riff hurricane thing Reveille and Apple O' pull off. But hey, as six brilliant pieces (four new) in the increasingly robust Deerhoof repertoire (one song's eh), Green Cosmos boasts sheer utility, making not so much its own statement but simply letting the band restate itself. Old seven-inch/live staple ""Come See The Duck"", here shortened, electrified and reimagined, remains Noisy Deerhoof's best summation: candy vox mels, hot licks in tandem, viciously unpredictable rhythms. Here ""Duck"" finds chum in cartoon scorcher ""Hot Mint Air Balloon"" (""mint air"" a reference to the EP title, itself a reference to what scientists believe to be the combined color of the visible universe) and ""Byun"", re-recorded for keyboards, more contrast, and unprecedented autism-- a high compliment. Understandably, everyone's gonna wanna talk about the title track, its Latin percussion and church organ breaks-- could-be-kitschy stuff that works because the melody's so rotten-good and the breakdown's breathtaking, unlike the chintzy magic carpet misfire ""Spiral Gold Town"". But the ballads, holy shit. Deerhoof tried writing these things before-- ""Littleness"", ""Days & Nights..."", ""Apple Bomb, and ""Satan"" came close-- but without fanfare the band came off a bit ghostly. Or maybe Satomi's just more confident now. In any case, ""Malalauma"" pits her against a tangle of guitar discord that threatens never to resolve, each side more menacing when contrasted so violently. And if ""Duck"" flagships Noisy Deerhoof, new song ""Koneko"" (Japanese for ""kitten"") does a fair job summing up Song Deerhoof (not to over-articulate a distinction, but you know). Backing Satomi's calm delivery, troubled guitar intervals slowly move to a resolution, and at the very last second, everything falls apart. In place, Deerhoof give us one wholly awful mess-- the song's clubbed foot that, for some of us, is quite endearing.","The spazz rockers' seven-song, 15-minute EP splits the difference between their noise- and song-based impulses.

The GrimmRobe Demos,Sunn O))),by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b7ea9e61561daa51d5/1:1/w_160/bb059a5c.gif,2005-05-17 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7580-the-grimmrobe-demos/,Southern Lord,"Holders of doom's most radiant name, Sunn O))) have conversely created the world's most grindingly slow soundscapes since forming as an Earth tribute band in 1998. Transcending the initial plan, Sunn O))) have birthed their own solar system across a number of mind-blowing albums. (And due largely to Sunn O)))'s championing and reintroduction of the earlier Seattle drone gods via an even darker approximation of their sound, Earth are having a bit of a revival with a live album recently out on TroubleMan, a remix album, and a new LP forthcoming on Southern Lord.) The low-end of both twosomes has inspired overwrought reviews; considering Sunn O)))'s inky imagery, Julian Cope guest poems, shared songwriting credits from ex-Melvins/Earth and current Thrones/High on Fire maestro Joe Preston, and sundry Norwegian associates, it makes sense that weighty metaphors are chosen to peg the guitar swarm. For instance, Australian artist Seldon Hunt's ""miasmic visionary text,"" which ably accompanies the reissue of Sunn O)))'s long out-of-print The GrimmRobe Demos. Titled ""ODE To THE GRIMMRoBE"", the 10-page Maldororian text attempts to recreate the land o' Sunn O))) via free association. As might be expected from an artist who's created artwork for KK Null and Neurosis, Hunt goes to pleasing imagistic extremes. Southern Lord returned the band's startlingly assured debut into print after discovering original copies on sale at eBay for upwards of $90. Recorded live in April 1998, The GrimmRobe Demos were first issues in an edition of 700 CDs by Hydra Head imprint. This new draft was re-mastered by John Wiese (Man Is The Bastard, Bastard Noise, Sissy Spacek) and includes an extra track, ""Grimm and Bear It"", which first appeared as a vinyl-only drone on the double-LP version of 2001's Flight of the Behemoth. These recordings showcase Stephen O'Malley and Greg Anderson at their most purely distilled. No words are spoken. No samples. No guest poetry. Just heavy fucking sustained resonances. But not going it alone for this particular marathon, ex-Burning Witch player Stuart Dahlquist ends bass (though, really, everything's kinda bass). Despite guests, Sunn O))) proper remain the offspring of Anderson and O'Malley. Esteemed in the underground world of metal, their family tree couldn't be stronger. Both played in Thorr's Hammer and Burning Witch; O'Malley also moves like molasses in Khanate and the Lotus Eaters. Anderson, who runs Southern Lord records, is in Goatsnake. So what exactly does this stuff sound like? The subtitle on the back of the CD helps: ""doom:power:ambient:drone:invokation"" At the band's Southern Lord home page, it's stated more verbosely: ""The SUNNO))) mission is to create trance like soundscapes with the ultimate low end/bottom frequencies intended to massage the listeners intestines into an act of defecation."" Now, pretend a Melvins' tune is made of taffy. Stretch it as far as it goes before it breaks. Think of Sleep's monumental Jerusalem leveled to a flat-line minus vocals or visible dynamics. Spin Keiji Haino until he's dizzy and then place with sunglasses painted black beneath a starless sky. Something equally slow, but with entirely different instrumentation is the exhilaratingly spare new album Geisterfaust by ""horror-jazz"" quartet Bohren & Der Club of Gore. Across ""Black Wedding"", ""Defeating: Earths' Gravity"", ""Dylan Carlson"" (named for the main songwriter/guitarist in Earth), and the aforementioned ""Grimm and Bear It"" there are no guitar solos. Sunn 0))) is focused on the swarm of the sound scape. Fluctuations exist, but as with hardcore minimalism, you'll have to press yourself into the waves and feel around before pulling out the glistening viscera: ""Black Wedding"" uses more squiggly/oscillating electronics and ""Grimm and Bear It"" features a different resonance/texture and more mid-range. It seems a good time to return to Sunn O)))'s formative sounds, especially as we await their newest and most ambitious effort, which includes guest spots by Leviathan and Xasthur's Malefic (vocals recorded inside coffins, which are inside hearses)-- as well as a cover of Immortal's ""Cursed Realms of the Winter Demons"". Recently playing live shows with Attila Csihar, Tos Neiwenhuizen, and Oren Ambarchi as part of the robe-and-hood crew, the band promises the new work will be their darkest and heaviest yet. I'm really not sure how these dudes can top what they've done thus far, but OK Sunn O))), bring it on.","Southern Lord reissues the duo's debut LP, which was recorded live in April 1998.

This may have been a rash decision. It's difficult to say what may have been in those books, but it can't be much worse than the confused tangle of inarticulate introspection, half-baked bravado, and anti-mainstream harangues that make up the bulk of the album. C-Rayz is one of the thousands of indie-rappers who routinely confuse ""expressionistic depth"" with ""not saying anything at all""; there must be a better way to convey post-millennial paranoia than a line like ""Inside the pain, my thoughts was in shambles/ My brain, like eggs, became scrambled."" And he uses the god-awful ""holding my dic [pause] tionary"" pun in two separate songs. Walz came up as a battle rapper, but here he mostly goes on vague philosophical tangents. And when he does lash out, his disses often come across toothless (""You're a clown; you wanna be down and sound gritty/ Your life was inspired by New Jack City""). It doesn't help that his voice is mixed ridiculously high, so it never gets a chance to settle into the mix. And most of these beats are boring noodley sci-fi indie-rap joints with no bounce or flow. The best Def Jux albums (The Cold Vein, I Phantom) are fully realized, unified works, but the tracks on Year of the Beast don't have a damn thing to do with one another. There's no sweep or vision, and so Walz's worst flaws are left exposed: his tendency to lose the beat, his obnoxious habit of multi-tracking his own voice, the lack of force or immediacy in his jumpy, splenetic delivery. It's a shame, since there's a much better album fighting to get out of Year of the Beast. On tracks like El-P's buzzing, broken apocalyptic banger ""Paradise"" and the heavy, burbling old-school dancehall throwback ""Pink"", Walz adjusts to the beat rather than forcing it to adjust to him. And Walz occasionally shows flashes of trenchant insight and eloquence. On the claustrophobic guitar-based stomper ""Blackout"", Walz is actually funny when he negotiates racial envy and confusion: ""I'ma be the shit at the meeting, statistically speaking."" If Walz had brought those strengths to the rest of the album, he might've had something. Maybe next time he should keep the Bic away from the rhyme books.","Def Jux artist's second LP features contributions from El-P.

A Certain Trigger,Maximo Park,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c356c0084474cd0c344b/1:1/w_160/2b5eec7c.jpg,2005-05-16 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5646-a-certain-trigger/,Warp,"There are two kinds of rock bands: Those who discovered the music first, and those who spent their allowance on leather and had nothing left for records. If Maxïmo Park fall into the latter category, they do a good job of hiding it. A Certain Trigger, the band's debut full-length, is rife with enough peripatetic song structures and lithe arpeggios to convince substance-questioning naysayers of the Newcastle quintet's musical smarts. But, to an extent, yes, they're bandwagon-riders, and latecomers at that. The New Wave revival has already dined out on the charts. That's why, working with the scraps of a restless trend-seeking audience, Maxïmo Park's recent success in their homeland is so surprising. Rather than turning up pebbles for the next Big Thing or exploiting a quirk, Maxïmo Park hone in on the specifics of an umbrella genre. Like the Futureheads or Postcard, they play jaunty, precise power pop with punk's antipathies, exuding a tentative cool. Managing (mostly) without fashonista caginess and attendant snark, Maxïmo Park are an easy sell. Occasionally, there's the requisite sneer at an ex or a self-deprecating barb, but A Certain Trigger is seldom anything short of gentlemanly. That civility translates to a sort of sneakiness. Maxïmo Park's muted dynamics, understated vocals, and starchy production stack up to a weak first impression. But over the course of a slow'n'steady courtship, the album develops character. The tug comes partly from deceptively complicated song structures. Maxïmo Park dispense with traditional verse/chorus/verse formatting while the melodies, insouciantly catchy, play dumb. Songs slide from verse to pre-chorus to chorus to bridge to post-bridge with little fanfare. You're lucky to get a repeat, but who needs one when the band whip out with one-time, eight-bar dalliances like the ecstatic, whirling bridge on upwardly mobile single ""Graffiti""? ""Apply Some Pressure"", the album's lead single, is typically roundabout. The song twists through some punchy, stiffly syncopated verses, each capped by a unison fill, before slipping into an extended bridge, driven by the type of harmony most bands would have been content to ride for an entire song. ""Going Missing"", with its propulsive beat and manic mood swings, is an overstuffed suitcase of post-breakup ambivalence: Lead singer Paul Smith is resilient while awake (""I'm going missing for awhile/ I've got nothing left to lose""), mournful in repose (""I sleep with my hands across my chest/ And I dream of you with someone else""). Aforementioned ""Graffiti"", which features a wiry, Voidoids-style non-groove, is aberrantly loose-limbed, but the architecture is anything but perfunctory, sprouting little detours at every intersection. The band's lack of swagger is refreshing amid the hot fussed-over convicts and misogynistic sun kings of the New Wave sphere, but it also hampers the less convincing tracks (i.e., ""Once a Glimpse"" and ""The Coast Is Always Changing""). There's also the question of why Maxïmo Park, a pop band, are on Warp, home to electronic visionaries Squarepusher and Autechre. The only reason I can think of is ""Acrobat"", an amazingly tender, drone-seeped song that harkens back to shoegaze and Velvet Underground while embracing modern gadgetry. It's Maxïmo Park's ""Maps"", a song at once exemplary of and antithetical to its brethren. Don't take the comparisons as caveats. Maxïmo Park don't use their forebears as stepping stones out of creative desperation; it's a mark of their business savvy. Even if you know what's hot, you still have to make it pop, and nearly every song on A Certain Trigger succeeds. Maxïmo Park leave their grubby prints on each track, be it the teeth-grinding squall riding atop ""Signal & Sign""'s second verse or the synths and organs lurking merrily underneath every song like a loner kid who snuck in to the dance party.","Warp's entry into the New Wave revival play jaunty, precise power pop with punk's antipathies, all while exuding a tentative cool.

Advice From the Happy Hippopotamus,Cloud Cult,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73a9d034d5c69bf373b/1:1/w_160/068144dd.jpg,2005-05-16 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1808-advice-from-the-happy-hippopotamus/,EarthologyBaria,"There's a state of mind in which infancy and mortality meet. Death, its inexorability, and our fear of it render us as helpless as when we were toddlers. Many of us fill the resulting tremulous mental gap with religion (""our Father...""); others with work, love, or grown-up childishness like golf; and you and I, perhaps, with pop music. Cloud Cult bandleader Craig Minowa is obsessed with this space-- with infancy, mortality, and, alas, infant mortality-- and his grandiose fourth album, Advice from the Happy Hippopotamus, occupies it with messy, expansive, computer-ok indie rock. I'm often captivated by bands that find quirky beauty in modest everyday moments. Cloud Cult do this, too, particularly on last year's Aurora Borealis, but here they more often aim for lofty apotheosis: for The Moon and Antarctica, Odelay, or the Radiohead masterpiece of your choice. Advice from the Happy Hippopotamus is utterly over the top, starting with its title and ridiculous cover art (see also: the name ""Cloud Cult""), and those hard souls who don't like it will find it easy to mock. The rest of us will find our crusty, professionally cynical veneers crumbling. Over an intimidatingly vast 25 tracks melding folk, electronics, Arcade Fire emo, and quasi-hippie hoobajoo, Cloud Cult gird their ambition with solid tunes. It's tempting to call Minowa, an organic farmer from the Minnesota wilds, a kind of insane genius. His voice is equal parts Isaac Brock yelp and Conor Oberst quaver, his CDs made of recycled materials, his home studio geothermally powered. He has the perverse confidence to open Advice with a wordless industrial freakout and bury the album's most accessible song, plaintive acoustic ballad ""Bobby's Spacesuit"", as a hidden track. Title track ""Happy Hippo"" buzzes like the Chemical Brothers, twinkles like a fairytale and boinks like a video game before recklessly pilfering from Neil Young's ""Hey Hey, My My""-- also, it's about a hippopotamus. (""She lives under my matt-uh-russ."") The album's sprawl is dizzying: Crystalline Sunny Day Real Estate guitar lines on ""What Comes at the End"", jaunty banjo'n'beats for ""Lucky Today"", a Books-like spoken-word near-death-experience on ""The Light at the End of the Tunnel"", the tearjerker chamber-pop of ""Transistor Radio"", the dreamlike call and response of ""That Man Jumped Out the Window"" (replete with dead-on Thom Yorke histrionics on the lyric ""There's a fine line between falling and flying""). Like Young's Harvest and Tonight's the Night, Advice also includes a live track, cathartic post-votum depression rocker ""Moving to Canada"", which is a fitting successor to screeds like ""Divide and Conquer"" by fellow Minnesotans Hüsker Dü. There's also one song, ""Car Crash"", with a female lead vocal, delivered somberly by Mara Stemm. The warm Four Tet programming of such tracks as ""Washed Your Car"" scatters Oberst's Digital Ash like so much cigarette ash (burn!). Flesh is a recurring theme. Does the human essence persist after its shell breaks down? This question is particularly compelling for Minowa, whose infant son died of unexplained causes in 2002, and whose spirit pervades this record. ""My skin is still me, with memories,"" Minowa sings on ""Start New"", but ""Living on the Outside of Your Skin"" attempts to break those surly bonds with toy piano and a growling guitar solo. ""What Comes at the End"" ponders reunion, reincarnation and ""fall[ing] in love in our new skin."" The elaborately off-the-cuff ""You Got Your Bones to Make a Beat"" celebrates existence with the unaffected joy of a dancing toddler. Like a little boy or a crazed genius, Minowa isn't afraid to look silly as he follows his muse into a bizarrely fascinating fantasy world. One track, ""What It Feels Like to Be Alive"", consists of Minowa hokily exhorting a concert audience to ""show the people of the world that you are alive"". Amid the ensuing communal yawp is one unconverted smartass-- a cipher, if you will, for a music scene fraught with carefully cultivated, ultimately unrevealing, laughably insecure projections of ""cool""-- who yells back, ""I'm dead!"" Don't be that guy.","Underrated indie rockers craft an expansive, 25-track LP about mortality.

Georgia Hard,Robbie Fulks,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beb55e6ef959693232ae/1:1/w_160/8750c2c1.jpg,2005-05-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3340-georgia-hard/,Yep Roc,"In the late 1990s and early 2000s, when high-profile artists like Jeff Tweedy, Joe Henry, and Rhett Miller were abandoning alt-country for younger genre mistresses, Robbie Fulks only flirted with pop music over drinks, maybe shared an innocent dance or two, but stayed loyal to his roots-rock old lady. After a disappointing major-label debut-- 1998's Let's Kill Saturday Night-- he rebounded to Bloodshot with Couples in Trouble, The Best of Robbie Fulks, and 13 Hillbilly Giants, and now is releasing his sixth album, Georgia Hard, on which he finally and fully indulges his obsession with the 1970s countrypolitan sophistication of Roger Miller and Don Williams. The problem with Fulks' fidelity, however, is simple: He doesn't have the voice for this kind of country music. It's too thin and textureless, with a nerdy nasalness that lacks the coarse grain of hard experience that marks so many of his idols. On Georgia Hard, he fares best on straightforward songs like ""Where There's a Road"" and ""It's Always Raining Somewhere""-- both of which start the album on a deceptively strong note. But Fulks just can't sell the hard emotions of the country noir ""Coldwater, Tennessee"" or ballads like ""I Never Did Like Planes"" or ""If They Could Only See Me Now"". He attempts to compensate by emulating everyone from Charlie Rich and George Jones to Faron Young and even Jimmy Buffett (on ""I Never Did like Planes""), but it sounds like mimicry and, over the course of 15 songs, feels a little disjointed. As a result, despite some admittedly well-crafted tunes, there doesn't seem to be much of a personality directing these songs. Such emptiness, however, is better than the threat of irony: Occasionally Fulks' vocals sound as though they are delivered with a knowing wink, as if he's satirizing the genre from the inside. Obviously, Fulks is sincere in his love of country music (a genre that prizes earnestness and disavows ambiguity), but it doesn't help that he seems more invested in jokey songs like ""I'm Gonna Take You Home (And Make You Like Me)"" (a duet with his wife, Donna) and ""Countrier Than Thou"", both of which prove no more subversive than your typical Ray Stevens song. And he's clearly enamored with the flushed-from-the-bathroom-of-your-heart strain of country-music wordplay. But his old-hat puns-- like ""All You Can Cheat"", ""Doin' Right (for All the Wrong Reasons)"", and ""Goodbye Cruel Girl""-- are long past threadbare. As with so many recent anti-mainstream country albums, Georgia Hard sounds less clever and risky compared to what has come out of Nashville over the past year. Big & Rich's Horse of a Different Color is much more imaginative and playful, and albums by Gretchen Wilson, Julie Roberts, and Dierks Bentley sound more soulful and innovative even as they draw on older styles. Does this Nashville resurgence signal an end to insurgent country? Is now the time for all those artists who've been out in the alt- wildernesss to reconcile with Music Row? Fulks in particular might have some radio hits in him, if only he'll let someone else sing them.","Former Bloodshot artist finally and fully indulges his obsession with the 1970s countrypolitan sophistication of Roger Miller and Don Williams.

Oceans Apart,The Go-Betweens,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf4413d197565213b878/1:1/w_160/ea2db1e4.jpg,2005-05-16 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3479-oceans-apart/,Yep Roc,"Should I still phone my class of '86 NYU buds whenever a new Go-Betweens record is released? The band has now released more LPs this decade than current indie staples like the Shins, New Pornographers, and Strokes, so can we please drop the ""Welcome back!"" fanfare. Fortunately, Oceans Apart doesn't need the same apologetic disclaimer tagged onto 2000's The Friends of Rachel Worth and 2003's Bright Yellow Bright Orange. Frontmen Robert Forster and Grant McLennan probably needed those two lackluster works to shake off 11 years worth of rust, but with Oceans Apart, Forster and McLennan regain their songwriting momentum. Forster redeems himself right from the start-- opener ""Here Comes a City"" is a jerky post-punk rocker highlighted by a jangly Middle Eastern riff. It packs more confidence and intensity in its first 10 seconds than all of Bright Yellow Bright Orange's hoary folk balladry. Of course, some credit's also due to longtime Go-Betweens producer Mark Wallis, whose presence on Oceans Apart also signifies a return to the stripped-down, lush atmospheres found on the Go-Betweens' landmark late-80s albums Tallulah and 16 Lovers Lane. Gone are the masturbatory Coldplay-sized string arrangements that plagued the previous two albums; in are supporting keyboards and intricately layered guitar parts. Songs like McLennan's somber ""Finding You"" benefit the most from Wallis's tinkering: Instead of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Forster's stark electric lead and McLennan's delicate ""ah's"" comprise the song's climactic bridge. As expected, Forster and McLennan fill every musical nook and cranny with delectable pop melodies, yet even Wallis's production wizardry can't revive the same enthusiasm and emotional allure in their voices that made subtle songs like ""Bachelor Kisses"" and ""Part Company"" such indelible classics. Yet as awkward as they sometimes sound, the Go-Betweens are still writing consistently gorgeous pop songs, and Oceans Apart proves they aren't content simply pleasing their most die-hard fans; they're back to making albums that, in a better world, appeal to everyone.","Latest and best record from the second incarnation of the Aussie greats.

Touch,Amerie,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0afea9e61561daa4605/1:1/w_160/a6d8365f.jpg,2005-05-16 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/458-touch/,Columbia,"When Amerie's ""1 Thing"" finally hit radio this March, it sounded like the arrival of spring. The song jumped and wriggled and moved like nothing else on the radio: a huge, loose-limbed, roiling, sweaty, berserk drum break, greasy guitars stabs exploding like fireworks. Rich Harrison, who produced Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love"", made the track, and it has the same sense of dizzy sunkissed freedom. But its greatest asset is the voice that cut through the drums like a sword, yelping and gasping and screaming for joy. ""1 Thing"" is the first track on R&B; singer Amerie Rogers' sophomore album Touch, and the album never again reaches the giddy heights of that song. It never could. ""1 Thing"" is all sweat and teeth and adrenaline. After that opening salvo, Rogers slowly settles into the pillowy, luxurious tracks that Harrison creates for her. Harrison's production has an organic core. He spent his formative years working in D.C. go-go, and his compositions have that loose-limbed swagger, relying heavily on sampled horn screams and weeping electric pianos. But his work never sounds like a throwback; his tracks all have a glossy, processed sheen. Amerie may be the perfect collaborator for Harrison's combination of Stax grit and Neptunes shine. Rogers has one of those thin, reedy voices popular on the radio right now; another producer would probably turn her into a sound effect, the way Lil Jon did with Ciara on ""Goodies"". But she has an urbane sophistication that sets her apart from the likes of Ashanti and Nivea; her precise jazz phrasing is the only saving grace on the mawkish ballad ""Just Like Me"". And when she has to, she brings out a fiery emotional center; on the breakup stomper ""Rolling Down My Face"", she squeezes across the song's tricky mix of regret and determination. Midway through the album, Rogers and Harrison come together perfectly for the second time on ""Talkin' About"", an impossibly catchy midtempo howler with a shifty drum track and the sort of glorious chorus hook that'll worm its way right into your brain. These two know each other well. Harrison produced eight of the 13 tracks on Touch, and too many of the other producers' tracks don't fit into his lush tapestry. Rogers can't do anything with Bryce Wilson's squelchy Neptunes keyboards on ""Not the Only One"". But Rogers brings her personality to tracks that wouldn't have worked otherwise. When Lil Jon shows up for the obligatory club track (the title track here), Rogers' frisky, coy vocal and a nimble little conga bit turn an otherwise leaden, paint-by-numbers crunk&b; track into a sexy little experiment with Latin freestyle. It may not be ""1 Thing"", but it'll do.","On roughly two-thirds of her sophomore album, Amerie combines her cutting yelps and gasps to Rich Harrison's D.C. go-go-rooted combination of Stax grit and Neptunes shine.

Big City Loser EP,Chok Rock,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a739ea9e61561daa5531/1:1/w_160/ac7b62f3.gif,2005-05-15 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1807-big-city-loser-ep/,Warp,"I hope Black Sabbath Riot 1980 gets reissued one of these days. The bootleg record is really nothing more than a field recording of the glorious disaster that was Black Sabbath's Milwaukee 1980 gig. The tape captures the band and frontman Ronnie James Dio being unable to erase the misery of Ozzy's departure, and to make peace with the democratic revolt of their audience. The record could be a cause for cynics to dance on rock's grave for the 23rd time, God's Chosen People to cast stones at the golden calf worshippers, and middle-aged metalheads with 2.5 children, a solid credit rating, and Thomas Kinkade prints among their Frank Frazetta posters. !!! drummer John Pugh showed me that record after fishing it out of a LP pile in his tiny car's trunk before his band played at a San Francisco gig. Now Warp reissues another of the band's recommendations-- the debut from Chok Rock, a Parisian glitch-hop unit that was discovered by a !!! band member at the Rough Trade record shop in London. Chok Rock materialized when Gael Baillier, a hard-lucked sound design businessman and guitarist, crashed into a few ships in the night: singer Camille Bazbaz (who calls their sound, ""A futuristic dampness impregnated with sex""), guitarist Cyril Kebellian, and visual artist Check Morris. They released their debut, Big City Loser on tiny label Chateau Rouge that went largely unnoticed until !!! passed along their record to the band's European label, Warp. Chok Rock certainly finds good company on that label as a few of their songs might be mistaken for Prefuse 73 B-sides and Big City Loser's cover art of jumbled scrapbook imagery resembles that of Extinguished: Outtakes. Still, these Parisians burn their fingerprints on the stereo. Opener, ""Give It Up"" is a near 15-minute robo-funk track that vaguely recalls Akufen with its micro-edited synths and R&B; croons. Midway through, a cloud of guitar steam breaks in to blow away leaves on the sidewalk. It's been said before, but it's a moment of old-fashioned music made seemingly new again with the right digital gloss. ""Buzz"" continues the electro element with higher calorie bassline, gnarlier guitarwork, and a stiffer groove that twitches shoulders, along with a sample of Beastie Boy King Ad Rock reminding everyone for the nth time, ""Ohmygod, that's the funky shit!"" ""Happy Man"" is more striking for announcing itself with a scream disintegrated in DSP fuzz before letting a George Clinton-like ladykiller croon through a CB radio on sprung ankle, crunk beats. And then there is the closer, ""Take a Plane"", where a bluesy, Sunday picnic jaunt with hookah-smoked flute is disrupted by editing mistakes and a looming UFO synth surveying the battlefield. On second thought, any Prefuse 73 references are moot. As Big City Loser indicates, whoever in !!! came across this record in the crates has done a public service. Let's see how these Gallic blokes 'n' lasses take the game afoot. Cheers, mate.","Thanks to A&R; work from !!!, Warp gives this French band's EP a wider release.

After previous releases on Tigerbeat 6 and Foote's own Outward Music imprint, the group makes a wholly organic transition to the Kranky roster with Cached, an album that swerves lithely between percolating new-wave funk, gracious blasts of abstract electronic drone and scrape, and mesmeric dub-inflected sway-- often in a manner which unduly sacrifices distinctive group identity in favor of pursuing their next elusive phantom mutation. During their time as members of chilly post-rockers Fontanelle, Foote and Dickow had occasion to put their fingerprints on recordings that were scrupulously edited and fussed-over to the point of sterility. Lesson apparently learned, on Cached the musicians maintain a much more rigorous and intuitive cycle of activity, naturally circulating an abundant pulse of fresh blood and vitality throughout the album's extremities. This (seemingly) more improvisational approach keeps the album from ever sinking into extended periods of frigid, monotonic stasis, although it also makes it more difficult for the listener to become truly ensnared in any of these sticky grooves for long. Album opener ""Classic Mode"" sends Cached immediately soaring as it combines Owens' languid, wintry vocals with a deftly narcotic dance beat and elastic strands of melodic guitar and keyboards, providing instant gratification to any waylaid Out Hud aficionados in its path. This effortlessly captivating track sets an elevated standard that Nudge spends the remainder of the album trying to match, and they come quite close to doing so on the skeletal, rubber-limbed funk of ""Contact"" or the lurching, percussive ""Remove Ya"", which features several overheated exchanges between vintage keyboards, honking melodicas and Owens' whispered, wordless exhalations. On ""Blon"", Nudge make their longest and most successful extended plunge into genre, maneuvering their way skillfully through a humid roots-dub landscape filled with the echoes of distant horns and murky waves of somnambulant keyboard throb. Less fruitful, unfortunately, are such electronic-based interjections as the motionless drone of ""Standing on Hot Sidewalk"" or the abrasive bounce of ""My New Youth"", ill-formed, insubstantial pieces that sound as though they could've originated from any number of lesser IDM acts. These tracks have an unflattering transitional quality, seeming almost as segues between the ample expanses of Cached where Nudge prove themselves able to boil on all burners, enticing the listener with their hopeful glimpses of the tantalizing peaks in the distance.","Former Tigerbeat 6 group joins the Kranky roster with an album of percolating new-wave funk, gracious blasts of abstract electronic drone and scrape, and mesmeric dub-inflected sway.

Somewhere in an ever-expanding universe of guitar, synths, and stuff your short-lived bad-kid playground friend probably pickpocketed from 7/11, the guileless boy-girl vocals of Iain Ross and Lisa Horton chase high-fructose melodies that start, stop, and change directions in mid-air like a butterfly or a hovercraft. Or: In what's shaping up to be a solid 12 months for arty indie-pop and schizophrenic noise-pop alike, English sextet Bearsuit lend the inspired innocence of the former to the joyous chaos of the latter. The gentle, melodic ""Cherryade"", with clip-clop percussion and May morning harmonies, could be The Boy Least Likely To or a more sonically adventurous Camera Obscura. ""Going Steady"" goes anything but, the frenzied energy of ""Popscene""-era Blur made weirder with herky-jerky changes and this year's nominee for Best Indie-Pop Comeback Instrument, the recorder.

Aimee Argote and Tim Herzog make few intimations of companionship on their debut album, Loose Lips Sink Ships. When they do, it's in songs like ""No More Fighting Cats, OK"", which reads like a neo-feminist signpost on Revolutionary Road. ""You scrub that smell off of your body/ Have dinner with the family/ Start picking me up on time/ Stop taking my car when I tell you that it's mine for the night,"" sings a livid Argote. Hardly lovey-dovey, and neither is the sound. Dark and jangly, Des_Ark manage to be as loud as any larger band, but with the added intensity of their compensatory bashing. Being at an inherent disadvantage volume-wise is actually a boon for many resourceful two-pieces-- especially those brandishing just guitar and drums. Stripped-down bands like Mates of State and the White Stripes (for whom balancing and mixing are less complicated endeavors than for, say, the Polyphonic Spree) can crank up the volume and utterly wail. Communication also becomes easier when there are fewer tastes to satisfy and voices to be heard. Unsurprisingly, then, Des_Ark are tight as Scarlet O'Hara's corset. Jammy influences pervade their screeching geetar-and-drums rock, but not in the traditional sense of unchecked soloing and rampant key changes. They're more scripted, nailing impressionistic odd-meter pirouettes and directing traffic through rhythmically congested passages. Argote and Herzog may have some skills, but they ain't above the Rules of Rock, which clearly stipulate that you ought not overdissect your hooks, else they cease to live. Save standouts ""No More Fighting Cats, OK"" and ""Jesus Loves You (But Yr Still Comin' Home With Me Tonight)"", which turn in Loose Lips' stickiest vocal hook and most anthemic guitar line, respectively, Des_Ark are too preoccupied with pummel and contortion to offer palliative melodies. The album is forbiddingly opaque and often brutally heavy for the idiom-- indie rock-- under which it will probably be categorized. With only eight songs, you have to wonder if Des_Ark sensed it was all a bit overpowering. Even at a slender 28 minutes the album can be a slog. But then, controlled chaos seems to be their M.O.

There's no way to know if records by Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom would sound any different had Bunyan never recorded Just Another Diamond Day in 1970, but songs from her lone album certainly sound fantastic sandwiched between cuts from Nino Rojo and The Milk-Eyed Mender. The record's spare production helps keep it from dating, but what really works today is Bunyan's soft, fragile Peter Pan voice. I imagine her understated whisper sounded out of step in its own time but now it sounds like a founding document of a certain school of indie singing. Bunyan's return to music after three decades away has been a gradual stroll back to the center stage. Guesting on records from Piano Magic and Devendra Banhart, she hooked up with Animal Collective while they were in London last year to sing lead on three new songs, which, combined with a sound collage by the Geologist, make up this short EP. It's not as immediately obvious a pairing as the Banhart duet on Rejoicing in the Hands because Animal Collective's focus changes so radically from record to record and its priorities sometimes shift from ""songs"" per se to something else entirely. A thread through the band's work to this point has been a focus on the emotional content of sound, apart from the nuts and bolts of the music. Even with an acoustic and relatively pop record like Sung Tongs the textural fixations remain, if only in the droney guitar sum that's become something of an Animal Collective trademark. How Bunyan's approach would mesh wasn't entirely clear. Prospect Hummer turns out to be an inspired meeting, as Animal Collective's material meets her Just Another Diamond Day aesthetic halfway. The common ground for everyone involved turns out to be the small details and pastoral mood of rural life. Hearing the familiar guitar swells that opens ""It's You"" brings us immediately back to the screened porch where Campfire Songs was recorded, while the presence of Bunyan's voice transports to a different but equally remote place. It's like suddenly finding a cluster of Maryland pines rooted on an English moor, something out of a dreamy film, with a vaporous melody that wants to drift up to the stars. The EP's title song is filmic in a different way, conjuring 30s Disney, Bunyan the graceful Snow White with Animal Collective's faithful dwarves trailing merrily behind, with a ""wah-wah-wah"" chorus that's certainly a marching tune. Words are hard to make out but something like ""loved to run up the tree branch/ And in the middle of it is a puddle of water/ Wind of faithful voices"" covers three of the four elements in short order. The Geologist provides the fire, though it's more of a low-level simmer, on his instrumental ""Baleen Sample"". He wasn't there for the London sessions but his five-minute contribution serves as a contrast with the three vocal songs, incorporating the strummed acoustic but layering in sound effects and various other instruments (nice use of steel drum) to create something comparatively dense. The brief and playful ""I Remember Learning How to Dive"" has the band singing in unison with Bunyan, ending the record on an appropriately communal note. It's a short EP, in fact it could almost fit onto a 7-inch single, but Prospect Hummer doesn't waste a note or a breathy sigh.","Folk legends past and present team up on this intriguing EP.

But it's survived and thrived while a succession of fickle post-rave fads have come and gone. Like many dance shops, BS spun off into a label. The Breakbeat Science Exercise series of low-price mix CDs are handy examples of the kind of d'n'b that skews more to the center than leftfield. They don't leave you feeling walloped with a 2X4, but you don't feel like you got suckered into buying Ultra Chill 6, either. So it's exciting that DJ Clever (owner of Offshore Records, mixmeister of last year's epochal Troubled Waters, and recent Pitchfork profilee) has been handed such an expansive platform to do his leftfield thing. (The Exercise mixes land in the megastores, like the aforementioned Borders.) Clever's got a knack for the sugared-pill: mixing up the rough (ridonkulously convoluted drum tricknology) with the smooth (the rolling boom-bap that's characterized post-1998 d'n'b). It's a line that gets skidded across on every Offshore release. Unsurprisingly, given the venue and audience's expectations, he goes with more smooth than rough. Even the more ""edit-y"" tracks here wouldn't clear a dancefloor. Some are even (gulp!) kinda boring, like the distorted drums of Cujo's slightly plodding ""Time Traveller"". Graphic's ""I Am Metal"" would be too sparse by half-- just a heavy-stepping beat and a tunneling bassline-- but finds its offbeats in Beans' rapping. (""I'm a rap motherfucker/ Wrap my hands around your neck."") Black Rain, aka Omni Trio's Rob Haigh, rocks the drum machine he once said he could never return to, skirting closer to the ""tech-house at 170bpm"" feeling of his old pal Deep Blue (who precedes him here) than the breakbeat euphoria of old. Amit's only got one trick, but I understand why so many labels keep re-releasing it: The scowling, strangely muted, utterly hypnotic mid-tempo bassline he's perfected. I don't hear much of the oft-referenced ""dub"" in his sound; it's closer to something like the Wighnomy Brothers ""Wurz + Blosse"" on Kompakt. Pieter K's ""Sequence"", on the other hand, is one of those too-fast pop-locking beats I suspect only breakdancing robots who catch on fire can keep up with. The mix really achieves lift-off in its final third. Seba's ""Steel"" trots out the old techstep trick of juggling one beat with a harder secondary beat, albeit in a warmer (yet still spooky) context. After the cold, electro-tinged basslines of a lot of the tracks here, its enveloping low-end is a balm. Graphic's remix of Ezekiel Honig's ""Love Sessions"" is the best track here and one of the oddest and most compelling d'n'b tunes I've ever heard. It's microhouse, essentially, except 50bpm faster, with great yawning bass groans, flushes of moody synth, and ultra-tactile beats. Imagine Pantytec jamming on ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" with added tape-speed issues. Tundra's ""Deep Sleep"" follows in a similar vein, though a bit more straightforwardly drum'n'bass, another excellent renovation of the supposedly exhausted 2-step percussion pattern. Exercise 05's dancefloor-centricity means it lacks Troubled Waters' range. And that's fine; drum'n'bass isn't required to expand or contract to fit a Pitchfork reader's (or writer's!) idea of excitement. This is probably a little too fast, a little too banging, to win converts. But there are still a number of tunes here that support all the breathless prose I've devoted to the d'n'b revival in the past 12 months. And at a suggested retail of around $7.99, you can probably afford to skip a meal to check out what all the fuss is about. I'm just going to keep bugging you until you do.","Leftfield d'n'b maven takes control of the latest Breakbeat mix.

Ghost Man on Second,Currituck Co.,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7029d034d5c69bf36b1/1:1/w_160/74985a26.gif,2005-05-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1759-ghost-man-on-second/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Don't know who'll step forward, but indie rock's seafaring history needs to be written. Prologue: Lou Reed, sailor suit/cap, walks the plank of ""Heroin""'s ""great big clipper ship."" That's a backward glancing start, but the bulk of the chapters will involve a Deep Listening of Slint, June of 44, Pinback, et al. providing ample proof that these landlubbers don't really know how to drop anchor or tie knots, but for some reason really dig The Odyssey. More esoterically, analyzing sine waves of noise trio Nautical Almanac's buzz offers evidence that freak-folk beards were inspired as much by Herman Melville as Devendra Banhart. Epilogue: Colin Meloy, eye-patch/life preserver/seabreeze facial cleaner, on Dickens' representation of shipyards. Currituck Co. aka Kevin Barker aka a fine banjo, acoustic, and electric guitar player but somewhat sketchy songwriter has added a footnote to this potential book with Ghost Man on Second, a 2xCD journey more or less reenacting a ""fabled"" boat trip. Following last year's often engrossing sets of bastardized standards Ghost Man On First, it's the weaker part deux in a series of three meditations on ""trees, families, nautical exploration, and John Fahey's body."" The sea thing isn't overt: More obvious is the indebtedness to Fahey. And because a goodly journey deserves a return, there's a pairing-off of songs across disc one (""In Two Towards"") and disc two (""In Turn Returns""): ""Embark"" vs. ""Disembark,"" etc. Besides conceptual ballast, improvisation provides the record's key methodology. Inspired by the blazing folk-raga and jazz drum pairings of renowned guitarist Sandy Bull and Billy Higgins, Barker's joined by Espers' Otto Hauser on the pitter-pat skins. Thus far Barker's done his best work by his lonesome: Hauser's a tentative player and seems to throw off Barker's timing. The drumming is also oddly mixed, sounding as if KB's standing on deck with Hauser locked in the ship's bowels. I get the polyphonic effect they're attempting, but it doesn't work. On various levels, Ghost Man on Second is in need of an edit. Thirty-minute excursions like ""Space Cruisin' Boogie (Remix)"" are admirably epic, but you really do need to earn a sitcom-length track. Nod here to Henry Flynt. And again for Sunburned Hand of the Man. Oh, and Supreme Dicks, please. A second disc-two ramble, ""Don't the C Look Wide and Deep"", finds Barker and Hauser losing synch: drums slip here and there, guitars lose track of themselves. Besides ""Disembark""'s intriguing banjo and Turkish drum dual, disc two's dead weight. It's a surprisingly sloppy and plodding set. (For a more inspired take, Ben Chasny and Chris Corsano kick up a maelstrom on Six Organs of Admittance's School of the Flower.) The stronger moments are on disc one. The launch of ""Embark"" could be Jewelled Antler playing a drum set's hardware. And ""My Home"" is an upbeat acoustic piece with vocals. Admittedly, Barker sometimes sounds like Kermit the Frog, but his sentiments about eschewing the Top 40 (""back 40 be my home..."") are sort of funny, or at least honest. On sister song, ""Where Is My Friend?"", the ""It's Not Easy Being Green"" melody is even a bit noticeable. Barker also just released Sleepwalks in the Garden of the Deadroom on Track & Field. It's a stronger, more cohesive jaunt, drifting into a singer/songwriter vein. So maybe this is seen as a collection of outtakes? Or outer-realm stuff that couldn't make it elsewhere? Whatever its lack, Barker/Hauser can't be faulted for attempting oceanic sprawl, but when players aren't razor-sharp regarding improv's ebb and flow, noodling grows ponderous fast. Here, instead of covering ground like true-blue Impulse!/Siren worthy explorers, Currituck Co.'s just treading water.","Kevin Barker present a 2xCD set that reenacts a fabled nautical journey.

Route 23,Chatham County Line,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a738b1335d7bf1698fe0/1:1/w_160/aa5bc2ab.jpg,2005-05-12 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1806-route-23/,Yep Roc,"Were it not for the clarity of the recording, you would be hard-pressed to guess that Chatham County Line's sophomore album, Route 23, was recorded this century, or even in the past 40 years. The album was recorded with the four members huddled around a microphone, harmonizing and plucking mandolins, banjos and guitars, and you can practically hear the dimensions of the room they're standing in. This is straight bluegrass without a hyphen or a prefix-- it has nothing to do with pastiche, a pose, or modern country music. From first note to last, it's obvious these guys have done ample homework. There's something refreshing about listening to an album recorded by guys who aren't afraid to unironically embellish an ending with a little ""yo-del-ay-hee"" or write simple, straightforward ballads that tell real stories with no gimmicks. Dave Wilson's lyrics are gloriously unpretentious as he takes the role of an inmate wondering aloud whether his wife will still be there when he gets out of prison on ""Arms of the Law"" or inhabits a hobo searching for warmth in the winter on ""Nowhere to Sleep"". They pale in comparison to the stunning title track, however, which tells the story of his father's business, a service station on Route 23 whose business all but dies when the state builds a new superhighway miles away-- apparently, Wilson's own father actually ran a hardware store that suffered a similar fate. What's truly striking about the way the story unfolds, though, is the lack of bitterness as Wilson refuses to cry over spilled milk. Of course, it helps that the music is like some sort of majestic time machine. Wilson's voice is strong but not overbearing, weaving memorable melodies into his narratives, and the playing is expert but never sterile or clichd-- on ""Saro Jane"" they even let the music unfold into a sort of organic soundscape with shuddering mandolin and hovering fiddle. The two instrumentals, fiddler/mandolinist John Teer's ""Gunfight in Durango"" and banjoist Chandler Holt's ""Sun Up"", are pumping two-step throw-downs, each bursting with wild banjo, fiddle, and mandolin. The harmonies are like a little slice of back-porch heaven: ""Louisiana Freight Train"" has the best, rich, swaying stacks of voices topped by guest Caitlin Cary that roll around the chords like clouds over the plains. There a few songs that don't quite have the momentum of the album's best material, but for a new band writing starkly traditional bluegrass (they only play one cover on the whole album), this is shockingly strong material, occasional hiccups aside. Obviously, if you're not into old mountain music, there's nothing on here for you, but if you enjoy bluegrass, dig in. The highlights here are as good as it gets.","Starkly traditional bluegrass and hard-luck tales color this band's sophomore album.

Seventeen Seconds / Faith / Pornography,The Cure,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c05e6ef95969320df1/1:1/w_160/e81d7640.jpg,2005-05-12 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11706-seventeen-seconds-faith-pornography/,ElektraElektra,"Between 1980 and 1982, the Cure switched lineups, switched producers, made friends with the pop charts, and steadily toured Europe. They also got drunk, got weird, got in fistfights with one another, took loads of drugs, walked off tour, and generally danced through some surreal Kabuki version of the Libertines' recent press. We're looking for a word and the word is ""tumult."" Which makes it kind of striking that they also, during those same years, released three remarkable records that represent the first phase of their many-phased career. These albums are the latest in Rhino's series of two-disc deluxe-package reissues: Stylish smoke-and-mirrors new-wave on Seventeen Seconds, dark pop drama on Faith, and all-out emotional assault on Pornography. What's so remarkable about them? Start with Seventeen Seconds, which is a perfect example of the kind of record that's been subdivided out of existence-- a lying-in-bed-dreaming record, a guitar record that make no distinction between pop pulse, rock catharsis, and the atmospheric space we now mostly get from computers. With this album, it's all three at once-- all the austere, spooky grace of Robert Smith's Asian-art fixations gathering up to inhabit a clean, minimalist new-wave package. Album-accounting types might get antsy over how many of these tracks are about building mood, slinking along as the exact opposite of today's amaze-me-now aesthetics. But even the shiftiest of iPod types, buried beneath the covers some morning, will remember that an album like this doesn't work any other way. The sound is like a bare room with four guys in black occupying just enough space to let you wander on your own, and when they stop slinking around and let the pop move-- see ""Play for Today""-- they do it with incredible elegance, winking and posing from behind the smoke machine. And then there's Faith, which sounds best of the three in about 60% of normal human moods. It's best in those bean-counting album-consistency more-for-your-money terms, sure, but that's hardly the big draw; the thrill here is hearing the Cure shape up into the singular band that trailed on through the next couple of decades. This is a band, after all, that did something indie guitar bands haven't lately been so great at-- tapping into vivid emotional drama in a form that felt entirely unpremeditated, creating a fantasy world coherent and accessible enough that your average 13-year-old didn't need to be up on any scenes to get sucked into it. A band whose career highlights were all about shading one intense emotion into another-- blurring the line between severe depression and total joy, making bright colors and Christmas seem like the mopiest things ever, and eventually, with Disintegration, making an album that was both oceanically bleak and entirely sparkly-beautiful, to the point where you imagine ghost-couples ballroom dancing to it. It all takes shape on Faith. Just listen to ""The Funeral Party"", a gorgeous, slow-moving synth wash that anticipates both Disintegration and the theme from ""Twin Peaks"". This album winds its way from ultra-sophisticated pop thrills (""Primary"") to synth mope (""All Cats are Grey"") to fierce snarls (""Doubt"") to snakey exoticism (""Other Voices""), all without ever changing its raw, minimalist instrumental setup or really seeming to shift course at all. It's packed with effortless old-fashioned emotional communication; it's a stone-cold classic; and here we reach the point where critics temper fan-boy impulses and leave well enough alone. All that emotional richness just brings us back to all that tumult, which somehow manages to color every inch of this material without laying hands on the performances: No matter how much the songs reek of crisis and desperation, the band seems as calm and on-point as a ballet troupe. That's precisely what makes Pornography-- which totally owns that other 40% of human moods-- work. This is one of those records where a band walks into the studio feeling stripped and grim and dedicates itself to creating something exactly as big and frightening, yelling at the producers that they really want that part to sound that ugly; Smith himself says he wanted the album to be ""virtually unbearable."" Which would make this the best possible failure. The result isn't as double-dark bleak as people like to pretend, thanks to the same streaks of vigor and beauty that make it such an obvious precursor to Disintegration. Smith's said the two records are part of a trilogy, and you can hear exactly that: The minimalist sound gets abandoned for just the kind of big, booming drama they came back to at the end of the decade, and the tired wailing of a track like ""The Figurehead"" sounds perfectly natural next to something like ""Fascination Street"". The record's most harrowing moment turns out to be a single: ""The Hanging Garden"", which is mostly just the relentless pounding of a single drum, with Simon Gallup's signature bass sound (the moves of a snake and the same scaly texture) rumbling beside it. If Smith wanted ""unbearable,"" he should have hired a different singer, because his voice makes this-- and just about everything else-- completely thrilling. Listen through any of these recordings, in fact, and you'll find yourself hanging on his every breath and moan, every word sounding as perfectly in-place as the well-groomed claps and trills of a chart-pop production. On ""The Hanging Garden"", he makes an understated wail hit you like a scream, which isn't a bad lesson for the world's hammier Iggy-wannabes: Half of the this stuff's wild intensity comes from how calm and steely-eyed and purposeful and just plain sweatless he sounds, and I can't imagine any other approach that could make a listener feel comfortable singing along with lines like ""Cover my face as the animals die."" Run the mood over to forlorn, and it's ""I could lose myself in Chinese art and American girls""; run it back to fierce, and it's ""It doesn't matter if we all die""-- just three of countless phrases that come out of his mouth sounding way more important than anyone else could manage. So that's three of the discs; the bonuses are a whole other animal. With so much of the Cure's single and B-side output already heavily compiled, this series has mostly restricted its extras to the kind of source material that proves a serious feast for box-set-owning Cure geeks: Scratchy home demos, rough studio takes, live performances, and associated rarities. Most notable on Faith and Pornography are the mood-setting instrumentals from the films that introduced the band on tour (""Carnage Visors"" and ""Airlock""); with Seventeen Seconds it's the A- and B sides, studio and live, of the sole single by Cult Hero, the project Smith and Gallup used to test their musical compatibility. (It sounds like either Ian Dury or Jilted John.) The rest of the Seventeen Seconds set offers some terrifically-recorded live material, as does the second disc of Faith; the Cure put a lot of studio time and echo-pressing power into giving Smith's voice the huge open-air sound these performances get pre-packaged. Across the rest of Faith's extras, the rarities pick up into material that seems more than just archival. There's the much-loved ""Charlotte Sometimes"" single, but the real gems are a quartet of studio out-takes-- three surprisingly sprightly instrumental tests (Smith mostly just moans) and an early version of ""Primary"" that's pretty much a whole other equally good song. (Current acts who aren't Radiohead may take note of what writing in the studio can accomplish.) Fullest of all, for obvious reasons, is the Pornography bonus; we're still working our way up to the sets of alternate takes and shelved songs that will probably accompany late-80s albums. Instrumental sketches of songs like ""Demise"" and ""Temptation"" can let you play Robert Smith at home (you are all of you welcome to record your own vocal tracks and send the results my way), and a totally-different early version of ""The Hanging Garden"" gives another weird look behind the tumult: Dysfunctional as the band may have been, they clearly still had the work ethic to write and rewrite songs until they turned out perfect. The live tracks here, sadly, aren't nearly as hi-fi as elsewhere. And that, in six discs and too many words, is phase one of the Cure, neatly packaged and neatly slipcased. When Rhino started this series, the timing seemed appropriate: The new-wave revivalists may not have tried copping these moves yet, but bands like the Rapture certainly had. Listening through these albums, though, you might come to a different realization. Old-fashioned and rockist as these criteria may be, the fact is that these albums have a raw resonance that frees them almost entirely from time and trend. The next few packages, after all, will see them dance through any number of timely styles without losing that center. And by the time we reach the ones beyond that, they'll have created the teenage-escapist fantasy world for which they're most remembered-- one whose singular thrills haven't changed with time or age. I'm looking over the stacks, and I can't spot any other band I can say that about.",,7.5,
The Saga of Mayflower May,Marissa Nadler,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97aeb335119a49ec7a9/1:1/w_160/7aa5a154.jpg,2005-05-12 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5908-the-saga-of-mayflower-may/,Eclipse,"Marissa Nadler's 2004 album Ballads of Living and Dying was a burnished gem of entrancing, spectral folk, and with her follow-up she not only returns to the luminous musical landscape of her debut but also to her enigmatic character Mayflower May. Though not the cohesive narrative its title implies, The Saga of Mayflower May again finds Nadler skillfully echoing the forms of traditional English balladry as she crafts another captivating collection of songs steeped in the melancholy of distant, half-forgotten passion, doomed love affairs, and various crimes of the heart. As a vocalist Nadler is considerably less idiosyncratic than such peers as Joanna Newsom or Josephine Foster, and here her dusky, lived-in soprano settles diffusely between contemporaries like Hope Sandoval and Chan Marshall, and 60s-era folkies like Vashti Bunyan or Mimi Farina. On these 11 tracks her arrangements are kept simple and powder dry, typically featuring only her 12-string guitar and the occasional flourish of organ, ukelele, or flute as accompaniment. With this spare instrumentation providing an understated backdrop, Nadler sounds increasingly relaxed and confident throughout the album, and each performance sparkles with haunting, rain-swept emotion. Tracks like ""The Little Famous Song"" and ""Horses and Their Kin"", are further distinguished by mesmerizing wordless passages where it almost sounds as though she's attempting to use her voice to approximate the lonesome shimmer of a singing saw. The significance of the character Mayflower May to these songs is unclear. Nadler has previously described May-- who also made a couple appearances in the lyrics of Ballads of Living and Dying-- as a lonely old woman of faded beauty. And though May is never mentioned by name on any of these songs, perhaps one is to assume that nostalgia-laden, first-person accounts like the opening ""Under an Old Umbrella"" or the rapturous ""Calico"" are intended to feature May as narrator. Also a talented visual artist, Nadler naturally fills her lyrics with color, and these songs abound with azure skies, turquoise eyes, and (especially) ruby red blood. On tracks like ""Yellow Lights"" and ""Mr. John Lee (Velveteen Rose)"" Nadler fearlessly enters traditional murder ballad territory, exquisitely depicting a world where love is forever shadowed by loss. Curiously, for the dramatic ""Lily, Henry, and the Willow Trees"" the album's lyric sheet includes a final, particularly gory verse that leaves little doubt as to the fate of poor Lily. Perhaps finding these lines out of keeping with her music's otherwise deft, subtle touch, Nadler leaves them unsung, one of the few instances on this enthralling album where she pulls any punches whatsoever.","Another record of entrancing, spectral folk and English ballads.

Entertainment!,Gang of Four,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bee6c0084474cd0c2f62/1:1/w_160/9471bdac.jpg,2005-05-11 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3389-entertainment/,EMIEMI,"Gang of Four were a pop band. Their funk was no less stark or forbidding than, say, the more astringent Timbaland productions. They certainly weren't as twitchy, speedy, or noisy as James Brown at his most energized. Their great innovation-- Andy Gill's morse code guitar, as if playing a riff for more than a few bars caused him physical pain-- is post-punk's most ripped-off idea after badly played disco drums. They had attitude, energy, the big beat, skilled players funneling their virtuosity into the necessary notes, a handy way with a catch phrase, and sweaty live performances. Sounds like pop to me. They formed in 1977 as part of a scene surrounding Leeds University's fine arts department that also included the Mekons and the Au Pairs. They were art students who named themselves after the Maoists that ran China until the leader's death in 1976. But they bonded over pub rockers Dr. Feelgood and 70s British blues band Free, exactly the sort of dinosaur hard rock post-punk was supposed to have purged in its own Cultural Revolution. The seeming contradiction, at least in terms of the Good Music Society the music press was constructing at the time, might have explained their sound, which critic Simon Reynolds described as a ""checked and inhibited hard rock: cock rock [with] the cock lopped off."" Andy Gill kept his guitar chilly, without the blanket of fuzz provided by effects pedals and the agreeable tone of valve amps. Blues riffs do crop up, but it's almost as if Gill is playing against his technique, scattering them like fishes in a pond with a scrabble of notes. He rarely engages in anything like a solo, the ejaculation part of cock rock. Gill's playing approaches rock drama through dynamics. On ""Return the Gift"" he's a shrill S-O-S pattern underneath the weight of Dave Allen's bass on the choruses, a flinty, almost Derek Bailey-like anti-solo. On ""(Love Like) Anthrax"", he sounds like he's trying to split concrete with a garden spade on a congested street. The guitars on ""Natural's Not In It"" are actually kind of sexy, in an uncomfortable frottage sort of way. The band says they were trying to get Allen to play a ""quarter of the notes he was actually capable of playing,"" which must be a pretty alarming number given his busyness on tracks like ""Damaged Goods"". The bass is the only fluid part of Go4's sound, and even that's more croaky than bubbling. On ""Ether"" there's no bassline to speak of, just big bullfrog gulps as the guitar clangs, bell-like, and a sinister high-noon melodica whistles in the distance. Drummer Hugo Burnham played funk beats and disco snare crashes but with all the reverb stripped off so that they splashed like alcohol. He's the band's secret weapon, and stuff like the hard snare crack that sounds like a handclap on ""Not Great Men"" is often what makes a song. When they all locked in, as on ""I Found That Essence Rare"", the effect is like stuffing 10 pounds of funk into a five-pound bag. Emotionally, however, Entertainment! is a brick. Like a black hole, no romanticism escapes it. Hints of black humor (especially in the artwork) creep into their aesthetic without overwhelming it. Relationships are reduced to ""contract[s] in our mutual interest."" Jon King often sings in the first person, implicating himself before anyone else: ""I can't work/ I can't achieve""; ""how can I sit and eat my tea with all that blood flowing from the television?"" Out of one speaker, Gill drones the production details of the love song like a bored copywriter on ""Anthrax"", concluding ""we just don't think what goes on between two people should be shrouded in mystery."" Out of the other speaker, King moans that he ""feel[s] like a beetle on its back/ And there's no way for me to get up."" Hardly head over heels, Go4 continually recast ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" as a death grip dragging you under. Go4 interrogated everything, including the band itself, with the kind of rigor only middle-class white art students can afford. But then they were a very English band, very much of a moment where being politically active precluded any sort of irony. (And besides, Bush/Blair may be as scary as Reagan/Thatcher, but Bloc Party aren't scrapping with Nazis at every other show.) Not for nothing was the band that really took their sound into the mainstream the Red Hot Chili Peppers, hardly models of good Marxist propriety. Even the recent, more stylistically faithful post-punk revival bands wouldn't poo-poo a love song. It would have been interesting to imagine Gang of Four as not just a pop band but as proper pop stars, because they would have been the driest pop stars ever. But instead, they refused to change a lyric the BBC found offensive for a planned ""Top of the Pops"" appearance, which effectively sunk their chart hopes. By the time they were ready to insert tongue-in-ass, no one wanted to hear their too slick take on what constituted ""pop."" Sometimes the people really do want it raw. Though they once might have looked askance at becoming an institution (of sorts), at least you can once again easily buy one of the great rock albums, now expanded with eight additional tracks. Anyone who says it's played out is a douchebag who deserves his Medium Medium records and willful obscurity. And that's one thing that I don't want to catch.","Rhino reissues the 1979 post-punk classic, adding the Yellow EP and four previously unreleased tracks.

Live @ the Fillmore,Lucinda Williams,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa3e9d034d5c69bf3de5/1:1/w_160/86bbcef5.jpg,2005-05-11 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8689-live-the-fillmore/,Lost Highway,"For better or worse, Lucinda Williams has spent the past couple of years living down Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. On Essence and especially World Without Tears, she replaced the Southern storytelling, travelogue nature, and plainspoken poetry of her breakthrough with an increasingly confessional tone and a decreasingly friendly voice. Her disposition has never been exactly sunny and her voice has always been a little gauzy, but she's grown defiantly prickly; as she obsessed over a broken relationship, wondering how it could cause as much happiness as pain, her songs have become more emotionally explicit, her voice more boozily abrasive. ""Ghosts in the wind that blow through my life/ Follow me wherever I go,"" she sings on ""Bus to Baton Rouge"", ""I'll never be free from these chains inside/Hidden deep down in my soul."" This trend toward extreme introversion crystallizes with Live @ the Fillmore, recorded over two nights in San Francisco. While the double live album is a time-honored tradition, Williams makes it immediately clear that this isn't going to be Double Live Gonzo! or Frampton Comes Alive! The first disk begins not with the requisite upbeat showstarter (although this version of ""Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings"" would have been perfect both sonically and thematically), but with a slow ballad-- three of them, in fact. Obviously, this is not the Lucinda Williams of the Car Wheels on a Gravel Road tour (chronicled on a New West Records DVD, released concurrently). The 22 songs on these two disks are culled mainly from Essence and World Without Tears, with only a few from Car Wheels, Sweet Old World, and Lucinda Williams (and none from her first two albums). Instead of leading us through the South of ""Crescent City"" and ""Jacksonville"", Williams takes us first out to California on ""Ventura"", one of only three geographically defined songs on the set (""Pineola"" and ""Bus to Baton Rouge"" being the others). Almost compulsively Williams airs her sins and misgivings on songs like ""Fruits of My Labor"", ""Three Days"", and ""Are You Down"", sounding both gushing and guarded. But her vocals, even on talking-blues songs like ""Sweet Side"" and ""Righteously"", reveal a woman living through all the messy frustration and unalleviated desire she's singing about. After a deliberately slow start, Live @ the Fillmore picks up considerably toward the end of the first disk. Williams spits venom on ""Changed the Locks"" and ""Atonement"", while her backing band, especially guitarist Doug Pettibone, generates ferocious bar-blues rock. The second disk reverses that trajectory, starting hard and fast but ending soft. The barreling momentum of ""I Lost It"" and ""Joy"" gradually gives way to the sexual/narcotic fervor of ""Essence"", the low simmer of ""Are You Down"", and the faltering disappointment of ""American Dreams"", which sounds even more like diluted Springsteen in this setting. The old Lucinda of Car Wheels reappears briefly on the final two tracks (both of which, ironically, postdate that album). She's there in the detailed memories and interior drama of ""Bus to Baton Rouge"" as well as in the delicate vibrato of ""Words Fell"". Both tracks are a little more hopeful than the equally gentle ones that begin this set, suggesting Williams has managed to exorcise some of those ghosts blowing through her life.","Recorded over a pair of nights in San Francisco, this live disc mostly draws from Williams' two latest studio releases.

Love,Foetus,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16cea9e61561daa47cd/1:1/w_160/cbb402ec.jpg,2005-05-11 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3128-love/,Birdman,"Next to ""the book was better,"" stating your preference for the British version of something has become the easiest way to sound smarter and more sophisticated than you actually are. Monty Python is funnier than SNL, Britain's The Office is better than the new American Office-- I can't even enjoy Spaceballs anymore without some sci-fi maven pointing out how it ripped off The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novels. So before you Yankee industrial buffs ravenously rip open your long-awaited copies of NIN's With Teeth, pause for urbanity's sake and acknowledge the visionary whose innovation eventually made everyone in the mid-90s want to ""fuck you like an animal""-- London's own J.G. Thirlwell, aka Foetus. Thirlwell's foray into mainstream industrial rock in the mid-90s almost destroyed him, literally. After his 1995 Sony release Gash, Thirlwell suffered from creative block and alcoholism for six years until triumphantly emerging with 2001's Flow, a resuscitation of the gnashing, sepulchral sound that made him an industrial pioneer. Unfortunately, on Love Thirlwell has neither shaken off all the rust nor decided to progress his sound any further since Gash. He's still Trent Reznor with a monocle, juxtaposing electronic drumbeats with Baroque-era harpsichord, referencing literary figures like Dorian Gray and occasionally singing in French. Feeling cultured yet? Don't. While including more melodic vocals in place of throat-chafing screams may be Thirlwell's riskiest move on Love, it totally tanks due to, well, the fact that Thirlwell's voice is abominable. We're not talking Jimi Hendrix or Bob Dylan bad here; this guy's tone-deaf sneer is utterly repulsive. On ""Don't Want Me Anymore"" he can barely stay on pitch for more than two beats, deflating the song's epic five-minute build. ""Mon Agonie Douce"" features plenty of film noir-inspired bells and whistles but little artistry, and Thirlwell's affected nasal crooning only compounds the problem. Now I know I've been avoiding describing the music, but you all know the selling points with Foetus: Grating, crunchy, layered, intricate, et al. Love's massive strings, sleazy film noir numbers and visceral guitar riffs will undoubtedly captivate fans of their last, oh, dozen or so albums. Thirlwell sticks to what he knows best on Love, but ultimately he sounds too much like an artist just happy to still be making records. Maybe it's because since the mid-90s the industrial sound has been picked up, dusted off, and mass-produced by snot-noised hacks like Linkin Park and Evanescence, or because listeners are blowing their synth/electronic music load on New Wave poseurs like the Bravery and Killers, but either way. Foetus's pissy eat-shit-and-die bit just doesn't have the bite it used to.","Industrial pioneer continues his 21st century rebirth.

Our Thickness,The Russian Futurists,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ddc0084474cd0c013d/1:1/w_160/604704d3.jpg,2005-05-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6880-our-thickness/,Upper Class,"Trying to describe the Russian Futurists' singularity without resorting to hyperbole can drive a critic mad. The pertinent signifiers have already been spread thin: Ye olde faythful Beatles/Beach Boys axis of anonymity pertains in theory, but it's become synonymous with vacant pop blandstanding and doesn't do justice to Matthew Adam Hart's oversaturated sugar smacks. It seems improbable that two of the most innovative bands of the rock era have become the myopic critic's go-to comparison for every poppy, harmonizing mediocrity that's too redundant to say anything else about, but here we are. There is something Smile-y about the voluminous synth swirls and donkey-punch drums that buffer the cherub harmonies of ""2 Dots on a Map"", but you know what? Forget I mentioned the Beatles or the Beach Boys. Then there's ""bedroom pop,"" which conjures faltering confessional lyrics, feeble electronic afterthoughts, maybe some detuned toy piano and tape-hissy ambiance. It's true that Hart records his songs on a shoestring budget, in his bedroom in Ontario. He might even swaddle himself in warm quilts and rock Garanimals footie-pajamas when he records, for all I know. And it's true these songs might lose some of the alien luster with a glossier studio treatment. But unlike bedroom pop's typically gauzy and fractured mien, Hart's tunes are confidently solid and percussion-heavy, rotundly popping, locking and soaring. On ""Sentiments Vs. Syllables"", a prickly metallic twinkle chases the vocal line around a mechanically precise bass drum, and ""Why You Gotta Do That Thing?"" is a woozy monkey-bar swing over halting, carefully rattling percussion and zippering synth trills. Nothing is self-consciously fractured or haphazard; the songs hang shaggily on rigid compositional armature. You know what? Forget I mentioned bedroom pop. Having exhausted our options, save for the requisite Flaming Lips/Magnetic Fields comparisons, we're left with hyperbole and lunacy. Hart's third LP, Our Thickness, is an exuberantly echoing starburst of lo-fi twee-pop gone grand, an opulent boudoir popera for the Taj Mahal. A crashfest of cheapo synths, poppity drums, and spun-sugar vocals, almost clownishly oversized: Check the loopy brass pageantry of ""Paul Simon"" or the sopping wet synths of ""Still Life"". It's an IMAX epic shot on Super8 and projected onto a bed sheet, a sumptuous coronation parade in a snowglobe, a theme park made of Tinker Toys: ""Our Pen's Out of Ink"", all distorted ba-ba-bas and jittery piano, and ""Incandescent Hearts"", with its foggy bleats and shimmering upsweeps, are postage-stamp epics, majestic in miniature. Get the picture?","Third album of lo-fi indie pop from the bedroom artist.

Queue for Love,Populous,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19513d197565213867e/1:1/w_160/ce134c96.jpg,2005-05-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6571-queue-for-love/,Morr,"Populous is bedroom laptop composer Andrea Mangia, a young producer who creates laid-back, hip-hop informed IDM, and although the second track with Doseone is entitled ""My Winter Vacation"", Queue for Love's gentle electronica evokes the first rays of spring and the slow thawing that follows. From the first track, it's clear Mangia is a talented imitator: ""The Breakfast Drama"" lays down the same layered, organic sounds as the opener to Four Tet's Rounds, without the sophisticated percussion. Later, ""Pawn Shop Close"" recalls Prefuse 73, from its hiccuping beats to the clipping of the string sample over top. Populous plunders the same bottomless musical mines as his more accomplished contemporaries (Four Tet, Prefuse, DJ Shadow), taking samples and beats from late 60s/early 70s soul and jazz and creating immaculate constructions. But while those artists dazzle technically, their samples, beats, and timing also unravel minor epiphanies, where repetition meets melody in a moment of euphoria. Populous has the samples and the skills-- ""Maqam Saba"" alone proves it, moving from multi-layered growling percussion to airy jazz guitar in the space of three minutes-- but Queue for Love is starved for those kinds of memorable moments. Guest vocals help the cause, but even the lovely tenor of Matilde (of Studio Davoli) on ""Bunco"" or ""Clap Like Breeze"" is a passionless texture. The best tracks are mysteriously back-loaded: ""Canoe Canoa"" loops graceful classical guitar over breakbeats, and ""Drop City"" is the funkiest this mild-mannered album gets. ""My Winter Vacation"" fares better, with Doseone relaxing his flow and turning subtle vocal modulations into self-harmonizing, as the ringing triangles and laid-back beats congeal into an inviting pastiche. From Queue for Love, there's no way to tell if Populous can use his sample library for distinct ends, or if he's just another non-face in the crowd, but I'll continue to play ""My Winter Vacation"" long into the summer.","More delicate and sometimes charming lap-pop from Morr.

Childish Music,Various Artists,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84713d19756521395fa/1:1/w_160/0a7d8bfd.jpg,2005-05-10 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2085-childish-music/,Staubgold,"Imagine allowing kids aged 3-6 do whatever they please inside a room of synthesizers, drum machines, Theremins, and uncovered turntables (loaded with their parents' records), and then recording the results. Maybe a rhythm could arise for a few seconds with a couple of thwacks here and there, and then there could be the violent, keyboard zigzags produced by fingers stuck in curious mouths. Perhaps, a renaissance in ""chance music"" could be realized. Such fantasies came to mind when I sat listening to Childish Music, and wondered what actual kids would think of it. Ekkehard Ehlers amassed this compilation of Japanese and European post-techno and folktronic artists whose work is deemed ""childish."" To his credit, Ehlers is a man of great courage and pluck in an art world often lost without a theory to explain it. He is best as a deconstructionist who has romance override any freeze-dried sterility that cynics stamp on conceptual electronic music, whether it is his homage to Albert Ayler and Robert Johnson or releasing his post-9/11 angst through a bass clarinet. His premises of having musical grownups act like non-musical kids earns a few brownie points, but the final product lacks key qualities of ""childishness."" I mean, where is the restlessness, the pretensions to being educational, and the playground-rhyme grossness? Instead we mainly get melancholic ballads that yearn for simpler times as told by their acoustic guitar and music box melodies. This music is clearly for post-post-adolescent adults, as sad music would bore nearly every runt to crocodile tears. If anything, it's just another gentle, twee-electronic pop record, but sans the healthy discord of say, DAT Politics (who are strangely absent here) or the lysergic depth of Electric Company. The disc's cheesecake shot of a schoolgirl playing telephone with a turtle confirms what demographic this CD is marketed for. Still, a pleasant bafflement is amiss here. Opener, Fan Club Orchestra's ""Mika Bubble Sing"" should have been Childish's template. Some scamp tries to gargle a tune with a mouthful of water with Mouse on Martian tone tweakings, provoking some cheap thrills and an idea for a Highlights rainy day activity guide. The following Beach Boys/Muppet Babies pop of Maher Shahal Hash Baz's ""Good Morning"" keeps the faith, although my cavities ache from its sweetness. Afterward, the compilation is divided into either digestible lullabies for post-toddler adults who need the whiff of Play-Doh or an animal cracker snack to give them reasons for living, or a peculiar translation of childhood memories into friendly, eight-headed beasts that come out from under the bed at night. Harald ""Sack"" Ziegler's ""Ritterball"" is the clear standout: A French-sounding lad seemingly chats with the producer while a haunting, street march beat arises in the distance with a guitar clearing its throat from time to time. Nobukazu Takemura, who deftly exemplifies how ""childishness"" can be written by digital glitches, delivers ""Vibrante"" a rather ominous polka tune where a motherly Japanese lullaby assures that everything is fine while awkward melodies on the accordion and xylophone warn emit a ""the sky is falling!"" alert, that seems to be no lie. Folktronicist Oren Ambarchi's ""Creepy Crawl"" warps an electric guitar with a rickety, whammy bar and backwards-looped vocals speaking in tongue. Devendra Banhart's ""Make It Easier"" is a soothing, clap-along gospel grown from the root in cold ground, making me worry about the indifference that children might have toward something so meaningful. But why did Matthew Herbert rock me to sleep-- causing me to wake up in four in the morning to wonder what socio-political subtexts about dissent against globalization that I missed? As Dr. Rockit, he executes "" Lullaby for William"" a lukewarm bossa novish lullaby all drenched in amniotic guitar tones and simple percussion that could be cracked U.S. Air Force rations recovered from an Afghan minefield. I mean, he once slightly charmed me with his house beats concocted from Starbucks cups and Big Mac wrappers-- what some could call an actual ""childish"" musical moment.","Ekkehard Ehlers-compiled LP of Japanese and European post-techno and folktronic artists whose work is deemed ""childish.""

Eccentric Soul: The Bandit Label,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83e13d19756521395e1/1:1/w_160/c2afea3f.jpg,2005-05-10 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2076-eccentric-soul-the-bandit-label/,Numero Group,"At 4114 S. Martin Luther King Drive in Chicago sits the specter of a building, a crumbling greystone indistinguishable from the thousands like it that litter the city's South Side. But this house has a unique and bizarre history as the focal point of one the strangest chapters in Chicago's musical history, that of Arrow Brown and his Bandit label. It's a chapter that's been mostly skipped over to this point, but that shouldn't obscure the fact that Brown's completely under-the-table recording company/commune/harem produced a clutch of impressive, honey-drenched soul tracks in its 12 years of operation. The late Arrow Brown was by all accounts a shady character, a Mississippi boy who transplanted to Chicago during the Great Migration and in his early adulthood looked to be living the American dream, with a family and a steady job at a soup cannery. But somewhere in the 1960s, he veered onto a different path, leaving his family behind for the seedy underground of the Second City, finally emerging in 1969 in that greystone, subsisting off the welfare checks of the nearly one dozen women he lived and likely consorted with. The Bandit story begins here, as Brown's wild weekend parties gave way to recording sessions featuring a huge cast of inspired amateurs and moonlighting professionals, who played uncredited to skirt musicians' union rules. In spite of the less-than-official arrangement, these are some truly hi-fi recordings, full of incredible string and horn arrangements, inventive backing vocals and funky rhythm sections that don't miss a Motown-inspired note. Though Brown used the singers at his disposal almost interchangeably, a few stand out as huge talents, including Brown's own daughter, Tridia. She was a member, such as one could be, of the label's flagship group, the Arrows, later the Majestic Arrows, and she was a great foil for the magnificent, sweet soul falsetto of Larry Johnson, a hugely talented singer who certainly could have gone places had he recorded for a label with the means to get him there. The two of them trade verses on the Majestic Arrows' ""Another Day"", a sweeping soul ballad that typifies Bandit's sweet, orchestral r&b; aesthetic. Another would-be star is Linda Balintine, whose two tracks are tough and funky, but the most tragic loss unearthed here is Johnny Davis. Davis was a powerful soul crooner with an especially commanding low range\xD1on the evidence of the few tracks he recorded, he had huge potential, but was the victim of a brutal murder in 1972 before he ever had a chance to truly blossom. Still, ""You've Got to Crawl to Me"" is a darkly funky tour de force, similar to something a pre-Superfly Curtis Mayfield might have cooked up. Given the paltry promotion clout of a label like Bandit, it's easy to understand why none of these songs-- released with their crudely drawn yellow labels-- ever became a hit, but there's no doubt several of them could have with the right push. ""One More Time Around"" has an urgent bounce, with a great bassline, ultra-catchy backing vocals, a strange, almost David Axelrod-ish violin arrangement and impassioned lead vocals, possibly by Tridia Brown. ""We Have Love"" is a scorching r&b; ballad, while ""Doing it For Us"" puts the majestic in Majestic Arrows with a massive flute-and-strings intro, couching Larry Johnson's amazing vocal in a bed of Baldwin organ and velvety orchestration. The man responsible for the crazy string parts and fractured rhythms that open ""Love Is All I Need"", Benjamin Wright, later did arrangements for Michael Jackson's Off the Wall. Brown actually attempted to make his son Altyrone Deno Brown into a sort of answer to Michael Jackson, recording his son at age seven belting a couple of monster soul tunes, ""Sweet Pea"" and ""If You Love Me"". The bottom line is that Brown's faith in his son's talent was not misplaced-- the kid sings his ass off-- but it may have been too early. As much as he really could sing, he sounds like you'd expect a seven-year old to sound, and his two songs on this compilation are really more useful for the sake of posterity (though not novelty, oddly enough) than for listening. The younger Brown did appear in several movies, including the Blues Brothers and won a Tony Award for his role in and off-Broadway musical version of A Raisin in the Sun, but when the Bandit label died in the early 80s and Arrow Brown's commune collapsed along with his health, he turned his back on show business and understandably gravitated toward a normal, stable life. Though it ended ignominiously, the Bandit story is a truly fascinating one, an extraordinary validation of the theory that truth is a great deal stranger than fiction and the kind of thing that's naturally intriguing to record buffs. As reissues go, this is in line with the Numero Group's other releases to date: meticulously researched, lovingly compiled, painstakingly remastered (sometimes from vinyl, by the sound of it) and uncommonly focused, and that's a big part of its appeal to collectors as well-- it tells the whole story and pulls no punches. All that's left to do is listen.","Another excellent comp from Numero Group, this time collecting lost soul from Bandit Records.

Headphones,Headphones,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c174abf31b7dc715660f/1:1/w_160/d01b7914.jpg,2005-05-10 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4008-headphones/,Suicide Squeeze,"Pedro the Lion's David Bazan goes Postal Service with this electronic side project, and please don't stop reading. Lap-pop is to emo-tinged indie rock as emo was to third-wave ska, aren't you on the listserv? Where Service-man Ben Gibbard found digital bubblegum (and offline gold!), Bazan trawls through his usual narrative-driven mope-rock balladry, for better or for worse. But never worse than the name Headphones, so emo kids, it's almost finally safe to show your bespectacled faces and stop pretending you like Death From Above 1979. After the bland misfire that was last year's Achilles Heel, Headphones' debut offers some hope for lapsed Pedro-philes. On ""Hot Girls"", Bazan and co-'phones Tim Walsh (Pedro the Lion, TW Walsh) and Frank Lenz (Starflyer 59) come their closest to the Postal dudes' ""Such Great Heights"". It's as perky as Bazan gets-- think an electro-pop ""Indian Summer""-- and the lyrics smile sidelong at the notion that ""style is taking over"" and ""songs are on their way out."" If Headphones have any shot at The O.C., this is it. Yet Bazan's latest is much more Edgar Allan Poe than Phantom Planet. Headphones turns dark early, with the opening murder/arson and insomniac synths of ""Gas and Matches"". On ""Hello Operator"", a cuckold strangles his ex-lover through the telephone to live, pounding drums and ghostly sonar signals. Bazan may be indiedom's second-favorite Christian, but as adultery-laden 2002 concept album Control proved, he's at his best moaning slow-motion stories about sin. ""Slow Car Crash"" closes the disc with futile airbags and touching last I-love-yous, glacial tempo befitting its title. The disc's two most blatantly political tracks stick out like severed thumbs, each pointing a different way. Veritable Bush bio ""Natural Disaster"" lays into Dear Leader with the album's second-sprightliest melody, but oh fuck Saddam what a refrain: ""Maybe a couple of airplanes/ Could crash into buildings/ And put the fear of God in you."" You know, I once used that as a pickup line. By contrast the previous track, ""Major Cities"", is as subtle as ""Natural Disaster"" is preachy. As (terrorist?) attacks decimate an empire, Bazan's doomed narrator admits, ""This doesn't favor me/ Still bullies ought to get what's coming."" Bazan's vocal sounds almost like Stephin Merritt's near-cracking lower range from ""Love Is Like a Bottle of Gin"", and spare, orderly keyboard accompaniment only highlights the similarities. It's a deft representation of the current political climate's many terrifying paradoxes. Against all expectations, my vote's for the dude from Pedro.","Pedro the Lion's David Bazan goes Postal Service.

Dom nailed the theory-- by now Excepter very well might be calling themselves a ""fractal noise band,"" too. But live the band is far less efficient. Sometimes they take eternities to pop, masking their moves with insider theater-punk and the vicious tease of frontwoman Caitlin Cook's jacket-only costumes. Blah, what are we waiting for exactly? With these guys I feel like I'm playing Ouija: I sense their secret language and know from experience their all-night junior high seance bit actually goes somewhere pretty fantastic. Excepter never crack though-- they're burlesque, the best sort of infuriating. But again, we don't get that from KA-- porno-pop by comparison. Even Excepter's live recordings lie a bit, since the gig's never just a withhold/release audio event and the band leans on drama to hook the camera-phone polloi. So here's Throne, a massive piecemeal of patient, throbbing noise, more molasses than anything I've seen them do live, somewhat demanding because everything does come together, spelled out in its own frustratingly roundabout way, as a good an example of this something-from-nothing stuff we can ask for from the latest crop of alchemists. ""Getting"" this band always wants to be an issue. Musically, they're full of shit; that's the point though. Excepter don't buy exclusively into music, but instead incorporate elements of music-- rhythm, melody, lyrics occasionally-- into their much larger project of sound. In other words, If you don't like how the band physically sounds, they're not worth your time. There's nothing to get about this band at all in that sense, since at least initially they're about sound on body, no encryption key for your pleasure, no computational step needed. That said, the difference between Excepter and just some pleasant sound (which so much of this shit is, really) is an unspeakable logic past the entrance point of pleasure-- the multiple threads mutating and interacting with one another all the time, some the band's piecing together for us, others left for us to make sense of ourselves. I know that sounds hoaxy, but something takes ""Jrone (Two)"" in 15 imperceptible minutes from a beautiful mess to a beautiful mess that growls and pulsates and wades in contradiction. Something takes ""The Heart Beat"" from a literal, pneumatic romp into hoarse overtones and palpable hopelessness. Something takes ""Jrone (Three)"" from Cook's shapeless rants to the record's most telling moment of clarity, Cook singing to us, ""It's not a simple formula it only is mine."" That means exactly nothing to me-- just a little bit of everything.","Excepter's latest is a massive piecemeal of patient, throbbing noise.

With Teeth,Nine Inch Nails,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40313d197565213be6b/1:1/w_160/1fba29eb.jpg,2005-05-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5803-with-teeth/,Interscope,"To some degree, Trent Reznor was a victim of his own success. As a fresh-faced misanthropic hottie screaming about god, money, and the two-backed beast over a 'roid-ragin' Tron soundtrack, he was exactly what the kids wanted. But when Reznor journeyed into the center of his sound and his soul, the kids took a rain check, finding their fix of synthesized cathartic self-loathing elsewhere. (Linkin Park, I think you might owe somebody a thank-you card; ask Reznor about the one he sent to Wax Trax! Records.) In 1996, the dude was so money that an EP of Downward Spiral remixes went gold, while both NIN full-lengths were well on their way to multi-platinum status. But in 2004, a full-length remix album covering the entire NIN oeuvre festered on the shelves of mall record stores, while Reznor's then most-recent studio LP (the double-your-pleasure doozy known as The Fragile) was shipping a measly one million copies. Meanwhile, the Bennington-Shindoa think tank (and their many contemporaries) were setting both young pierced hearts and old moneyclips aflutter with sexless, sample-soaked tunes of dismay and despair. Where once they screamed, ""You get me closer to God!,"" kids now shouted, ""Shut up when I'm talking to you!,"" which is in line with, ""I'd rather die than give you control!"", except Reznor's ""you"" is some disembodied existential thing, the stuff of stylized drama. Chester's ""you"" is someone he knows; this time, it's personal, and he wrote it down in his journal. In AABB form. In 2005, Reznor kicks off With Teeth with ""All the Love in the World"", a track that can easily be read as a response to his fading celebrity in the wake of the success of countless imitators (""No one's heard a single word I've said/ They don't sound as good outside my head""). From the start, it seems he's about to go spelunking up his colon yet again, ninth-grade poetry in tow. It begins pensively, with a wet drum machine beat punctuated by soft piano notes while Reznor asks the question on nobody's mind: ""Why do you get all the love in the world?"" And then comes the disco break. The beat locks down. The piano gets in line. Reznor returns to the titular question-- this time in a falsetto-- and screams it back, call-and-response style, harmonizing with himself. A bass drum, tambourine, and backing vocals hop on board. And when the bassline kicks in, and it's as though he's dropping a mirror ball on Goth Night at Club Velvet, as all the young Robert Smiths and Siouxsie Siouxs in the crowd proceed to drop it like it's hot. ""All the Love"" has nothing on the porn-serious bump-and-grind of ""Closer"", but it's not trying to horn in on that action. For about 90 seconds, there's an epidemic of full-on Kool and the Gang dance fever-- and it actually sounds fantastic. On ""Only"", Reznor speak-sings his way to each chorus, playfully talking about picking scabs and other sorts of self-castigating things. And, wow, what a ridiculous chorus: ""There is no fucking you/ There is only me."" It's like he's singing to himself in the mirror, either restaging the Buffalo Bill scene from Silence of the Lambs, or the Jena Malone/Susan Sarandon hairbrush bit from Stepmom. ""You Know What You Are"", meanwhile, is in line with what typifies hyper-aggressive NIN teeth-gnashing, though it's accentuated with the unmistakable might of Dave Grohl on the traps, ripping off those machine-like 16th notes. Elsewhere, lead single ""The Hand That Feeds"" finds some on-the-one magic, while ""Getting Smaller"", the record's poppiest track, comes off as a faster-paced cousin of Pixies' ""Planet of Sound"" (with a Pere Ubu quote thrown in for you hipster cats). And let's not leave the Mark E. Smith nod from ""With-ah Teeth-ah"" unmentioned. As expected, the album does eventually find time for a brief detour into the sort of twinkling soundscaping that's perfect for staring off into space and forgetting the pains of quotidian torture, but for the most part, With Teeth manages to flip the script on Reznor's recent M.O. Instead of fronting like a more feminine Al Jourgensen-- hard, coarse, yet not totally abrasive-- Reznor comes across as the masculine yin to Shirley Manson's alluring yang: playful, coy, and with a flair for the dramatic. The disc ends with the tortured Bowie-esque balladry of ""Right Where It Belongs"". Here, Trent's piteous ruminations on what-the-hell-ever-- (""What if all the world you think you know/ Is an elaborate dream?"") are slyly undercut by an audience's cheers and applause. It's Reznor as a leather-clad Elton John, sitting at the piano to play ""Candle in the Wind"" one more time. But rather than indulging in a pointless rehashing of past glories, With Teeth finds Trent Reznor moving forward by coming to terms with what he hath wrought. This head like a hole's come a long way, baby.","Former alt-rock star Trent Reznor releases his first studio album since the 2xCD disaster The Fragile.

His four post-Fire Show mini-LPs were all stuffed with ideas and encrusted with analog sound-dust, emotion spilling from the collision of multiple strange sounds and simple yet alien arrangements. The last of these releases, Am I Free?/I Am Free, is a sort of double-EP featuring two 20-minute, five-song discs in austere, silk-screened packaging that's meant to be the swan song of the Resplendent persona. Despite having generally the most traditional instrumentation of all of Resplendent's releases and focusing heavily on the acoustic guitar, it sounds no less deliciously alien or warped than its predecessors. In his disarmingly honest liners, Lenzi lists six albums that he feels most influenced the proceedings: Neil Young's After the Goldrush, Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die, Talking Heads' More Songs About Buildings and Food, Swervedriver's Mezcal Head and two Springsteen records, Nebraska and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle. Honestly, it's not hard to hear how all of these things bubble under the surface of this music, even if none of the songs sound explicitly like any of them -- there's Young in the acoustic guitars, Nebraska in the bleakness, Biggie in the beats, Swervedriver in the shimmering washes of guitar-- though the way it's all mixed together defies easy categorization. Both discs having stunning openers, Am I Free's ""In My Quiet Car"" ranking with ""Judas Priest Cul de Sac"" as one of the greatest post-Fire Show Resplendent tracks. Lenzi's nasal croon hovers with flutes over a wall of acoustic guitar: ""Everything large and loud and bright will settle down/ The barking dogs and gusting winds will soon whimper and subside."" It sets the tone well for a record that feels like it's trying to come to grips with sorrow and cynicism in order to leave it behind, as though Lenzi wants the death of Resplendent to signal the laying to rest of his own anxieties. ""Dust of Luck"" leads off the second disc with a quick burst of shimmering Philip Glass-ish texture, but it's just a feint away from the meat of the song, a wash of astral country stuffed with multi-tracked acoustic strumming and searching slide guitar. He goes for his trademark grab bag on the rest of disc two, flirting with electro-reggae on ""A Tourist No More,"" diving into glitchy anthemics on ""Beer Muscles"" and cultivating an avant-garde music box effect on the instrumental ""Hope"". The music has a dramatic sweep to it, but feels as though it's ready to come crashing down at any moment as drums stutter, guitars swerve off course and the tape reaches the saturation point. Lenzi is caught between vehement conviction and self-doubt on ""Destiny Afterbirth"", declaring ""this culture is bullshit"" with spitting authority but ending with the question ""momma did I do okay?/ Cuz nothing is like what you said it would be like."" Those lines could very well be Lenzi pondering the Resplendent legacy, an output that would fit on two CDs if you squeezed it but that nonetheless covered a barely fathomable range of musical terrain. All of his releases since the Fire Show were produced in limited quantities and none received the attention they deserved, so it's hard not to wonder if there's any bitterness or regret hiding out in those lines. Then again, he also sings ""I won't waste another phrase on bitterness and sorrow/ I won't waste another day,"" so it could be that this is just a new beginning for an innovative, underappreciated musician. Let's hope so.","Latest from ex-Fire Show man Michael Lenzi is a pair of 20-minute, five-song EPs.

Carousel Waltz,The Robot Ate Me,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28c9d034d5c69bf2c0b/1:1/w_160/7ff2149b.jpg,2005-05-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6806-carousel-waltz/,5RC,"The Robot Ate Me's new LP, Carousel Waltz, is dominated by folky ballads that occupy a somber but hopeful emotional space. That approach suits The Robot Ate Me better than you'd think if you've heard the maniacally diverse They Ate Themselves or the experimentation of On Vacation-- and if you're a listener who chucked the first half of On Vacation, it's almost like this record was made with you in mind. The instrumentation here is almost ordinary compared to The Robot Ate Me's previous work, with nearly every song played with acoustic guitar and muted horns. The band is stingy with its arrangements, bringing in the simplest bits of melody or rhythm only at the most necessary moments. ""Where Love Goes"" is a near-baroque guitar strum that drops everything for some evocative woodwinds, sounding as if someone snuck Sketches of Spain in with the band's Phil Elvrum records. The same is true of ""Lately"", which interrupts its sober gallop with a repeating horn figure that adds both rhythm and a bit of swing. The songs may not all be a barrel of fun, but many are hopeful: ""Bad Feelings"" hints at redemption even as it sings ""she's been feeling pretty bad about life,"" and the upbeat tracks are well-alternated between the darker meditations on love and regret, like with...""Regret"", a gentle folk song that declares, ""Regret won't change who you are/ Unless you take its lessons too far."" Carousel Waltz drives a pretty flat road, without the peaks and valleys of their previous work, but that suits the grounded emotions and realizations they're addressing, skirting the line between the unaffected and mundane. They teeter on the edge with lines ""I never thought that love was real until she came"" or ""Let's just love each other and hold on tight,"" but the tight arrangements coupled with Ryland Bouchard's creaking voice are consistently charming. On Vacation isn't quite what The Robot Ate Me made it out to be last year: We'd like it to be reckless and indulgent experimentation or nothing but brightly-colored Polaroid highlights, but we're more often left with a lot of time to kill to just sit around and think. Carousel Waltz is the product of just that, the summation of thinking long and hard about where you're headed, and it's a braver and more honest record than anything they've done to date.","Reminiscent of Phil Elvrum's work, the latest from The Robot Ate Me effectively skirts the line between the unaffected and mundane.

Dimmer,The Zincs,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab3a13d1975652139b8b/1:1/w_160/a51b1405.jpg,2005-05-09 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8938-dimmer/,Thrill Jockey,"Years ago, when I worked at Blockbuster Music for a summer, I scoffed at its laughably broad, sociologically pointed categories. Pop/Rock. Rap/r&b.; Dance/Techno. This was the best they could do? There was a Punk endcap display (Daft Punk featured prominently) and, amazingly, two rows of DC Go-Go (my manager was a fan), but there was still much room for improvement. It is the privilege of the young to believe that simple solutions can solve complicated problems, and I decided to devise more accurate categories. Complications immediately arose. Should Less Than Jake be filed under Ska, or Punk? Or Ska-Punk? Would I be allowed to make a section just labeled Crap? Cross-referencing was impossible; I was attempting a Gmail task in a Hotmail world. It is the privilege of the young to abandon any task that provides the slightest resistance, and I did just that. The Zincs take me back to that dilemma: Is Dimmer indie rock, alt.country, or neo-folk? Who knows? That's what the Pop/Rock category's for. Dimmer is the Zincs' sophomore LP, on which the formerly solo Jim Elkington finds himself with a permanent band including members of Fruit Bats and Euphone. It's a really solid record, unassuming yet memorable, subtle: It's mildly melancholy, modestly dark, and discreetly brooding. Its most striking feature is Elkington's voice, a wry bass vibrato wrapping around sardonic lyrics. ""Before I became a smoker, I used to sniff paint in my fathers shed/ With my passion for ingesting toxins, I felt by 13 that I'd be dead,"" Elkington deadpans over the ominous glissandos of ""Stay in Your Homes"". It would be pretty easy to mistake Dimmer for a Smog record. But repeated listening reveals a deeper, more imbricate bed of influences. I'd never realized how similar Smog and J. Robbins can sound until I heard ""Breathe in the Disease"", an enticing dirge where smooth acoustic guitars vie against stabs of dark, messy chords, a subtle electronic haze floats over soundtrack strings, and Elkington's voice sits immovably in the eye of the quiet storm. Like the delicate minuet ""Bad Shepherds"", with its prickly Spanish guitar, ""Breathe in the Disease"" at once smacks of Smog and of Burning Airlines's smoldering slowburner ""The Surgeon's House"". ""Beautiful Lawyers"", with its percussive acoustic strum, shushing electronic melody, and reverb embellishments, evokes the neat melodic turns found all over Yo La Tengo's Summer Sun, as do the folk-rock guitars and electro stutter of ""Moment is Now!"". The opening phrasing of ""New Thought"" seems an homage to Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"", and the rail-riding ballad ""Passengers"" checks in with early Cohen and Donovan. The album's overall blend of rustic acoustica and subtle electro resonates with Dave Pajo or Windsor for the Derby, and by yoking all these far-flung stars into a new constellation, The Zincs achieve a distant shimmer that sounds old, feels new, and is distinctly their own.","Thrill Jockey band blends indie rock, alt-country, and neo-folk.

Gimme Fiction,Spoon,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51d13d1975652138e88/1:1/w_160/2be1e880.jpg,2005-05-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7430-gimme-fiction/,Merge,"For more than five years and three albums, Spoon have occupied the weird purgatory between being one of the largest names in indie rock and barely-there mainstream recognition-- big enough to see print in Time (for Kill the Moonlight), but not big enough for that magazine's 30-and-up demographic to care. From their earliest flirtations with Elektra, Spoon were a dark horse in an industry that values the easily, tritely categorized; every album was a shift in sound, subtly tweaking prior formulas, distilling an already minimal sound into something even more distant. So far the refinement is evident, and they've followed success with even more success because, ratios aside, Spoon's intrinsic elements have never changed. Head-first, maximum R'n'B and tense, shuffling rhythms back Britt Daniel's unparalleled vocals and despite constant re-invention, Spoon remain, inimitably, Spoon. Understandably then, Gimme Fiction succeeds for the same reasons, but that doesn't mean it's a step forward. Instead, Spoon return to more familiar territory-- some of which they haven't glimpsed since Soft Effects EP-- by pushing guitars back to the front occasionally, kicking out big 4/4 anthems, and leaning on some heavy rock piano to create a brooding, anxious album that's superficially more straightforward than anything they've done in years. For better or worse, Kill the Moonlight is a tough act to follow; after pushing their sound to its stripped-down limit, anything less than a further push into the frontier sounds like compromise, but, as Daniel howls on ""The Beast and Dragon, Adored"", ""If you believe, they call it rock and roll"". It all depends on your perspective. Gimme Fiction is actually a wildly diverse album, almost schizophrenic in its composition, vacillating between acoustic ballads, a bubbly, synth-tinged number (""They Never Got You""), handclaps, strings, and a whole lot of blue-eyed soul. It feels like rock action only because the album's finest moments-- for the most part-- are in the sublime climaxes of guitar-driven tunes, notably the heart-swelling, tambourine-ringing relief of ""Sister Jack"" or the beautifully spare ""I Summon You"". But calling them ""rock songs"" feels like an oversimplification: The term implies a simplicity that just isn't present even in the most direct offerings on Gimme Fiction. ""The Two Sides of Monsieur Valentin"" illustrates an attention to the deeper, nuanced elements-- piano and cello flourishes run alongside the guitar chords and carry it to a stunning crescendo; the sheer volume of different noises at work underneath the melodies is enormous, and not one of them is out of place. The boys in Spoon have come a long way since the surefire blast of ""Car Radio"" (or even ""Jonathon Fisk"", for that matter), and even the most direct songs here have a precision craftsmanship rarely heard in something that is still, at heart, a rock album. A rock album-- except for a single song that rejects that assertion completely, and is one of the most breathtaking songs Spoon has ever produced. ""I Turn My Camera On"" is a Prince-tastic masterpiece hearkening back to the Stones' ""Emotional Rescue"", but with a show-stopping grandeur that beats them both at their own game-- for one song, anyway; when it comes to soul, Britt Daniel has more in his larynx than Mick Jagger now has in his cold, lifeless body and the call-and-response between his backing chant and his own unbelievable, dual-layered falsetto proves it in barely three-and-a-half minutes. Spoon continue to refine and redefine their product, but rarely is the distinction between one adventurous standout and the rest of an album so marked. A smart band could build a career on the sound just tossed away in ""I Turn My Camera On""; in this case, I'd have settled for just one more song, but even if the alternative is business-as-usual for Spoon, that's still pretty great.","On Spoon's newest record, they sometimes push guitars back to the front of the mix, kick out big 4/4 anthems, and lean on heavy rock piano, resulting in a brooding, anxious album-- the most straightforward of their career.

The Dirty Old One Man Band,Scott H. Biram,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48613d1975652138d18/1:1/w_160/2e5024f3.gif,2005-05-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1159-the-dirty-old-one-man-band/,Bloodshot,"A few days ago, while I was driving along a winding country road listening to Scott H. Biram's debut album, I saw a dead possum lying square across the double yellow line. That image has stayed with me, so that every time I hear The Dirty Old One Man Band, I think of roadkill: gnarled viscera, bloody fur, flattened body. Obviously, this isn't high praise by any means, but the point of the comparison isn't to suggest that Biram's music is disgusting or lifeless. In fact, it suffers from a surplus of personality as Biram constructs a hillbilly stage persona by borrowing from Jon Spencer, R.L. Burnside, Jack White, Southern Culture on the Skids, Yosemite Sam, Tom Waits, the Reverend Horton Heat, and David Alan Grier's cameos on that Dionne Farris album. No, the point of the dead possum comparison is this: like that particular type of roadkill, Biram's mock-blues songs are Southern kitsch, their musical elements deep-fried and trucker-capped to the point of caricature. Biram recorded The Dirty Old One Man Band on the fly, mixing live tracks with studio recordings and improvising songs he's road-tested over years of touring. Despite the added handclaps and tambourines, his approach is loose and immediate. However, Biram's not nearly as funny or as clever as he seems to think he is, a deficiency that is underscored by the off-the-cuff approach and that makes the album more tedious than entertaining. On ""Someday Baby"" he voices both sides of a conversation between his feisty lady (who gets the typical effeminate falsetto treatment) and his loutish, late-coming-home self (who gets the final word-- ""Shut up!"" which he repeats like a comic lamely milking a catchphrase). It's not really all that funny or weird, not here and definitely not on ""I See the Light/What's His Name?"" or ""Downtown Chicken"" or any of the other times he does it. The Dirty Old One Man Band blends a wide range of styles, from blues and rock to country and even a little bit of bluegrass now and then. Gospel and spirituals lie beyond his reach, but Biram proves a capable guitar player, generating forward-moving boogie-blues riffs and reveling in the cheap-amp distortion. The medley ""Throw a Boogie/Black Betty/Just a Little Bit"", recorded live at the Parlor in Austin, mixes up the songs as Biram's animated guitar threatens to wrestle free of his grip, and ""Truck Driver"" is a barreling stomp with extra horsepower from backing band the Weary Boys. Despite the artifice that precedes it, ""Sweet Thing"" even manages to be sweet, as Biram drops the act to write and sing a simple, direct country song, proving that there's a real person underneath the persona.","Singer/songwriter mixes live recordings and studio tracks on this Bloodshot release.

King of America,Elvis Costello,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a678c0084474cd0c098d/1:1/w_160/47d1d395.jpg,2005-05-08 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1626-king-of-america/,ColumbiaColumbia,"Back in the midst of the Thatcher era, it must have been startling to see Elvis Costello staring back from the 12-inch-by-12-inch black-and-white LP cover of King of America, looking much older than the young rabble-rouser on the cover of 1983's Punch the Clock. Instead of the enormous Buddy Holly specs that had been his trademark for years, he continues to sport a pair of understated wire-rimmed spectacles that-- along with that facial hair-- lend his visage a grave, almost academic air. Bedecked with an ornate crown and an embroidered jacket, he hides his recognizable features behind a bushy beard, and his weary eyes manage a wary look. More surprises awaited eager listeners: On the spine, the artist was listed not as Elvis Costello and the Attractions, but, more puzzlingly, as the Costello Show. Similarly, the songs were credited to Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus, the acoustic guitar parts to The Little Hands of Concrete. In fact, the name Elvis Costello was barely mentioned in the packaging at all, as if MacManus needed a vacation from his alter ego. These oddities heralded an even more dramatic change within the vinyl grooves. King of America was MacManus's first album without the Attractions since his debut (they appear on only one track, ""Suit of Lights""). Instead, through co-producer T-Bone Burnett, he had corralled a strong roster of impressively pedigreed studio musicians (he calls them ""my jazz and R&B; heroes"" in the new liner notes) that includes Jim Keltner, Mitchell Froom, and Tom ""T-Bone"" Wolk, as well as Ron Tutt, Jerry Scheff, and James Burton from Elvis Presley's T.C.B. band. They lent the songs a professional albeit occasionally slick feel and helped MacManus realize his country and R&B; ambitions. What wasn't different, however, was the barbed wit and acid humor that infuse songs like ""Glitter Gulch"", ""Jack of All Parades"", and ""Brilliant Mistake"". Costello's career to this date is often idealized as perfectly angry-- Costello the scourge-- but it contains a very human number of mistakes and miscalculations committed, on his own admission, by a very confident artist and a very confused man. The 31-year-old singer's anger and outrage had been diluted with disappointment and experience: the band was in turmoil and on the verge of breaking up (and would after one more album); MacManus's marriage had recently ended; he had been playing innumerable live shows to counter legal woes; his previous album, GoodBye Cruel World, had been a flop (he refers to it as his worst). The result of all this angst is a complex and conflicted album that, despite all the spit and polish, sounds lively and raucous. Intense romantic embitterment informs the wordplay of ""Lovable"", the willful caution in ""Poisoned Rose"", and the extended metaphor of ""Indoor Fireworks"", which is all the more devastating for MacManus's straight-faced delivery. Likewise, the idea of America-- his adopted homeland, if only temporarily-- simultaneously repulses and attracts him. On the powerful ""American Without Tears"", he compares his own loneliness and alienation with that of two World War II G.I. brides, as Jo-El Sonnier's accordion plays over the chorus. Not knowing exactly what to do with such a bristly, ruminative album, Columbia Records unenthusiastically released the cover of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" as the first single, then promptly forgot about King of America, as did most listeners. A proper (and final) Elvis Costello and the Attractions album, Blood & Chocolate, was released before the year was out (on which Costello credited himself as Napoleon Dynamite). Rykodisc unearthed King of America almost a decade later, and Rhino is reviving it two decades later as the final installment in its ambitious and generous reissue project. While many of the 21 bonus tracks-- including the A- and B-sides of ""The People's Limousine"" / ""They'll Never Take Her Love from Me"" by the Coward Brothers, Costello's side project with T-Bone Burnett-- were included on the Rykodisc version, the real finds on this edition are the seven live tracks from one of MacManus's few shows with the King of America band. They fare respectably on the album track ""The Big Light"", but the band, especially guitarist Burton, blaze through covers by Waylon Jennings, Mose Allison, and Buddy Holly. King of America may not have sounded like anything else Costello had done before, but it bears a striking, even disheartening, semblance to almost everything he's done since. In the ensuing years he has worked hard to excerpt himself from the British punk movement and to indulge his obsession with prepunk styles like classical (The Juliet Letters, Il Sogno), cocktail-lounge jazz (North), country (The Delivery Man), and Brill Building pop (Painted From Memory). This musical restlessness-- along with almost everything the middle-aged Costello has been criticized for, such as his practiced delivery, his overly calculated songwriting, and his obsession with backing musicians and collaborators-- has roots in King of America, his first and finest assertion that he has a life apart from the Attractions. For many who were initially baffled by that cover image of MacManus, this album is the beginning of a long downfall; for others, it's merely Act II in a very long, very prolific career that is unusual for having so much buried treasure.","Originally credited to the Costello Show, this is a newly reissued and expanded version of the 1986 LP that saw Declan ditch the Attractions and return to his pub-rock roots.

Make Believe,Weezer,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ecea9e61561daa48fe/1:1/w_160/3bbd7736.jpg,2005-05-08 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8614-make-believe/,Interscope,"If you're one of those poor souls who while away the day job by keeping a scorecard of music review sites, there's one thing you already know: There are two distinct groups of bad albums. The more prevalent kind is the fodder that fills a critic's mailbox, bands with awkward names and laser-printed cover art that don't inspire ire so much as pity. The second group is more treacherous: Bands that yield high expectations due to past achievements, yet, for one reason or another, wipe out like ""The Wide World of Sports""' agony-of-defeat skier. Often, these albums are bombarded with website tomatoes for reasons you can't necessarily hear through speakers: the band changes their sound and image to court a new crossover audience, perhaps, or attempts a mid-career shift into ill-advised territory. Or maybe they start writing songs about Moses in hip-hop slang. But sometimes the bad album in question is none of the above; it doesn't offend anyone's delicate scene-politics sensibilities or try to rewrite a once-successful formula in unfortunate ways. Sometimes an album is just awful. Make Believe is one of those albums. Weezer have been given a lot of breaks in their second era-- both The Green Album and Maladroit were cut miles of slack despite consisting of little more than slightly above-average power-pop. The obvious reason for this lenience has to do with the mean age of rock critics, and the fact that most of these mid-20s scribes were at their absolute peak for bias-forming melodrama when The Blue Album and Pinkerton were released. Even for someone like me, who came late to the Weezer appreciation club, it was impossible to hear these ""comeback"" albums without the echoes of the earlier alt-rock pillars ringing in our ears. But now there's an antidote to that nostalgic interference. Right from the start of Make Believe, when Weezer lurches into a flaccid take on Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock N' Roll"" with an unfathomably horrible speak/sing vocal from Rivers Cuomo (think ""I like girls who wear Abercrombie & Fitch""), you can hear hundreds of critics mouthing ""no no no"" and going into crumpled shock. What's more disconcerting is that the song gets worse over the course of its three minutes (let's just say ""Framptonesque voicebox solo"" and get back to repressing the memory)-- and it's the album's first single. Hearing a song like ""We Are All on Drugs"", which nicks the classic melody of the schoolyard ""Diarrhea"" song (you know, ""when you're sliding into first..."" and so on) for an anti-drug message stiffer than Nancy Reagan's ""Diff'rent Strokes"" cameo, it calls into question whether The Blue Album was really that great, or whether it just stood out as a rare beacon of guitar pop in a grunge-obsessed era. Trying to wrap your mind around the land-cliché-record lyrics of songs like ""My Best Friend"" and ""Haunt You Every Day"" leads me to wonder how Pinkerton could ever have seemed like such a cathartically resonant treatise on unrequited love. Was Rivers Cuomo always on the notebook-scrawl level of ""I don't feel the joy/ I don't feel the pain,"" and did we not notice because scrawling in notebooks was the depth of our emotional knowledge at the time? Okay, let's not be so hard on ourselves here: I'm pretty sure this is all Rivers' fault. Pinkerton triumphed by being an uncomfortably honest self-portrait of Cuomo. On Make Believe, his personality has vanished beneath layers of self-imposed universality, writing non-specific power ballads like he apprenticed with Diane Warren, and whoah-oh-ohing a whole lot in lieu of coming up with coherent or interesting thoughts. Coupled with his continued obsession with tired power chords and bland riff-rock (surprisingly not sonically boosted by producer Rick Rubin, whose post-""99 Problems"" grip on relevance is now officially spent), the creative driving force behind the Weez is asleep at the wheel. Considering Weezer supposedly went through hundreds of songs and several discarded albums to arrive at this final product, the laziness of this songwriting borders on the offensive. Whether recycling dynamics from the band's back catalog (see: ""Perfect Situation"") or taking the easy Mother Goose rhyme (see: every fucking song here), these 12 tracks sound as if they were dashed off in an afternoon's work, maybe with Rubin holding the band at gunpoint. The one half-decent song on the record, ""This Is Such a Pity"", fails to even maintain its status as a pleasant Cars homage, interjecting a guitar solo that sounds like it was cut from the original score to Top Gun. So does Make Believe completely ruin not just present-day Weezer, but retroactively, any enjoyment to be had from their earlier work? I don't know-- I'm too scared to re-listen to those first two albums-- but it certainly appears that Make Believe will expertly extract the last remaining good graces the critical community has to offer latter-day Weezer, unless my colleagues' memories of slow-dancing with Ashley to ""Say It Ain't So"" are more powerful than I can possibly imagine. Of course, if Ashley went on to break your heart, fellow critic, Make Believe might be just the medicine you need; put it on repeat and watch your emotional scar be obliterated as collateral damage in the torpedoing of Weezer's legacy.","After a couple of free passes, the third album from the 21st century incarnation of Weezer uses up the band's last shred of nostalgia-driven goodwill.

Metal Cares,Picastro,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1945e6ef959693201fe/1:1/w_160/cf522c94.jpg,2005-05-08 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6570-metal-cares/,Polyvinyl,"Often folk acts are as meek and delicate in person as their music would suggest, and Toronto four-piece Picastro are no exception. After L.A.-based Pehr Records released their 2002 debut, Red Your Blues, Picastro inexplicably left the label. Refusing to step on any toes, the band remained tight-lipped about the affair despite claiming how awful the experience was. Singer/guitarist Elizabeth Hysen immaculately personifies this innocuous, victimized pathos, suffering from hyperaesthesia-- a sensory condition in which victims suffer from increased sensitivity to stimuli (think Daredevil). Appropriately, Metal Cares exudes a sound seemingly tormented by sleep-deprivation, pain, and-- most pressingly-- fear. Hysen's vocals are much more prominent in the mix than on Red Your Blues, allowing her every grief-stricken crack and murmur to resonate above the equally tortured instrument parts. The track list serves as a peek into Hysen's neuroticism with titles like ""I Can't Fall Asleep"", ""Teeth and No Eyes"", and ""Sharks"", named after one of Hysen's foremost phobias. However, Hysen, a straightforward, no gimmicks songwriter, keeps the lyrics short and cryptic, not to mention unintelligible. On the chorus of ""Dramaman"", Hysen wails indecipherably amidst shrieking strings, while the ballad ""Sharks"" builds to a muffled chant sounding like ""bigger hunter, hello hunter"". Good luck trying to decode ""Ah Nyeh Nyeh."" With her garbled drawl, Hysen could pass for a German laptop pop artist, though her bandmates' instrumental workings borrow the most from that genre. Rather than adopting the punchy, infectious folk-pop of past tourmates Cat Power or Smog, Picastro are content with allowing their songs to methodically unfold. Opener ""No Contest"" patiently unfurls on a cyclical acoustic riff for two minutes before finally revealing the song's subtle yet gorgeous refrain. Despite this asceticism, the album still contains several beautiful, striking moments between the gossamer acoustic strumming and haunting strings . Hysen's hushed, sparing vocals leave a lot of open space between verses, but she's hardly twiddling her thumbs during that time. For all the allure Hysen's voice generates, her acoustic/electric interplay with guitarist Zak Hanna is the true glue that holds the LP together. ""I Can't Fall Asleep"" builds to a jarring chorus that features Hanna's reverb-drenched electric against Hysen's dissonant, ringing acoustic. Closer ""Blonde Fires"" puts a warmer, more inviting spin on this interplay, allowing the guitars to intermittently carry the lead melody. It's a sound awkwardly caught between Elliott Smith and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, balancing pretty acoustic melodies with chillingly shrill clangs and screeches. But hey, that's the unapologetic, enigmatic Hysen for ya; for all we know, part of her probably wants to be ""Miss Misery"", but the other half simply can't stop freaking out over sharks.","Toronto folk-pop band explores sleep-deprivation, pain, and fear.

Peel Sessions EP,Hot Snakes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c12613d197565213bb5e/1:1/w_160/a2284177.jpg,2005-05-08 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3933-peel-sessions-ep/,Swami,"It's difficult to discuss Hot Snakes critically without sounding obvious. Your best recourse is incendiary imagery better suited to a John Woo flick than a record review, and no one wants to read that shit (the Hot Snakes also make you want to swear a lot). It isn't ""talking"" music. Just the opposite-- it's a mandate to clam up, drive fast, bang the dashboard, stop thinking, smoke with the windows up, stay on the gas. Most rock bands in today's aggressively eclectic musical climate at least have the decency to tack on some random funny noises for the critic to latch on to, but the Snakes just aren't that considerate. It's difficult enough to write about them when they have an album of new songs that are uncomplicatedly good and nearly identical to their last batch, but when they put out a 10-minute EP of four previously released tracks? Holy aphasia. Better stick to the facts: Last October, Hot Snakes flew to the BBC studios to record what would be John Peel's final session, one week before he died of a heart attack in Peru. Their Peel session consists of two songs from their debut, Automatic Midnight, and two from their latest LP, Audit in Progress, which sound like the album versions with a slightly rawer edge. Strangely absent are any tunes from their sophomore record, Suicide Invoice, which many regard as their finest. While the EP doesn't reveal anything about Hot Snakes, it confirms their reputation as a remarkably vigorous live band. Their streamlined proto-punk is a more direct version of the style Rick Froberg and John Reis cemented with Drive Like Jehu, and radiates an unfettered urgency that's often missing from modern rock. There's a palpable sense of danger hanging around Froberg's aphoristic splatter, Gar Wood's concisely brutal bass, John Reis's searing, metallic leads, and Mario Rubalcaba's runaway percussion. ""Automatic Midnight"" is a blinkered dash over scorched riffage, Froberg alternately sneering apathetically and spitting rusty nails. ""No Hands"" rumbles over a laddering riff and pigsticking one-note leads, and standout track ""Braintrust"" slams a frantically gyrating rhythm into throttled riffs as Froberg intones one of his most menacing choruses. ""This Mystic Decade"" closes the EP with a more laidback melodic blast-- a concentrated burst of visceral pleasure.","This four-track set was the last-ever Peel session.

The Beast,Nathan Michel,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4595e6ef95969323a34/1:1/w_160/4ccbc837.jpg,2005-05-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5264-the-beast/,SonigSkipp,"In theory, computers are a boon to musicians interested in the classic art of pop arrangement. In the days of Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach, it took a lot of planning to organize a number players and the studio clock kept going through all the mixing and tinkering. Now you can sit at home, record, layer, cut, and paste. Thing is, to do sophisticated arrangements and harmonic exploration correctly requires a certain amount of formal music training-- more than your average dude with a laptop has put in. Nathan Michel studied composition at Princeton, so he has such a background. His first record for Tigerbeat6, ABCDef was typical of that label, heavy on noises that must have once seemed weird, light on recognizable patterns and repetition. To me it was good for a single listen, but Tigerbeat6 has put out so much in that vein that it must be connecting with somebody. On his second record Michel added vocals to his pieces; now, continuing his popward trajectory, his third album is heavily weighted toward conventional songs with vocals. The Beast isn't even an electronic record as such, as Michel records himself on guitar, drums, melodica, horns, reeds, keys, the list goes on. For all its instrumental variety, The Beast sounds remarkably clean and balanced. Similar to Jim O'Rourke on Eureka and Stereolab since the late 90s, Michel's charts play down the bass and focus on subtle interplay in the midrange. Drums are mostly polite taps, while guitars and keyboards are given space to complete each other's sentences and congeal into clever chord progressions. It's the kind of music that sounds terrible loud but perfect at that level where it just fills the room with sound. Michel's even got a decent voice, especially compared to your average IDM guy who wants to give vocals a try. His singing on the title track is particularly strong, coming closer than anything else to the Beach Boys feel he obviously admires. The song's entwined nylon string guitars and various shakers evoke the island idyll High Llamas called ""Hawaii"". Despite the sophista-pop proclivities, Michel hasn't left the Tbeat6 glitch world behind completely. The title track is pushed off course by the occasional intentional hiccup, a gentle reminder of the even acoustic music's ultimate digitalosity, but the carefully assembled mood endures. The drowsy piano ballad ""Status Dive"" contains similarly intriguing sonic tweaks, with odd intrusions of horns that seem to be peaking in from another record. Michel's voice keeps getting snagged on the hard drive in ""Suds"", lagging behind an upbeat tune that sounds like early, ""jazzy"" Chicago. Instrumentals like the buoyant technicolor calliope theme ""Planet"" are why the DAT Politics guys who founded Skipp wanted to be involved. When I first heard The Beast I thought of Max Tundra, another one-man-band project who has evolved from his spazzy Tigerbeat6 days. Michel's music on The Beast doesn't have the thrill or unpredictability that Tundra brings, but Michel is tapping into a tradition that values a sense of control. The Beast isn't always exciting but it feels very complete, with that satisfying click of parts snapping into place.","Former Tigerbeater leans toward vocals and Jim O'Rourke-like sounds on this Sonig release.

Hives Fives EP,Parlour,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffdb1335d7bf1697f0a/1:1/w_160/c7128f45.jpg,2005-05-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6178-hives-fives-ep/,Temporary Residence,"Although brief, this four-song EP signals a major directional shift for the Louisville-based instrumental outfit Parlour. First established in the late 1990s by Tim Furnish-- a vet who has played with such scene stalwarts as Crain, the For Carnation, and Papa M-- Parlour's two previous albums were essentially glorified solo works, featuring tracks written by Furnish between the years 1996-2001 that relied heavily on atmospheric swells, drones, and textures derived from his laptop. The Parlour featured on Hives Fives, however, is one who has undergone an extensive and beneficial renovation. On these tracks-- recorded by Paul Oldham in December 2004-- the now full-fledged group has expanded to a seven-piece, together utilizing a substantially broader range of live instrumentation. These new additions, particularly the bass clarinet and saxophone work of Steve Good and Craig McClurkin, help to infuse and circulate enough fresh blood to animate every square inch of Furnish's compositions, resulting in Parlour's most vibrant and distinctive work to date. Bursting with layers of burbling analog keyboards, guitars, and locomotive drumming, Hives Fives could garner comparisons to Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die. Another significant point of reference is the seminal work of post-rock pioneers Pell Mell, whose lively, expansive melodicism is echoed strongly in Parlour's deft guitar and keyboard interchanges. Even so, on Hives Fives this extended version of the group make considerable advances in establishing a unique, recognizable identity that was sometimes lacking on Parlour's earlier releases. It certainly doesn't hurt that all four of these tracks come equipped with several massive melodic hooks, each able to shape-shift from one chorus to the next without the group breaking stride. On the introductory ""Such (A One Year Stem)"" dense synth and woodwind drones combine to lay down an absorbent carpet of moss beneath the competing volleys of chiming guitar and percolating drumbeats. The title track is a throbbing, lively, forward-looking piece of such sunny disposition that it almost resembles the soundtrack to an unusually adventurous industrial video, sounding as though it should be providing accompaniment to quick-cut footage of robots busy building jet engines or minting new pennies. ""Timorme"" coordinates puffs of narcotic clarinet and Bitches Brew keyboards before giving way to irregular, modernist guitar jangle, while the closing ""Bringseeds"" pushes things even further off-kilter, as pulsing electronic chords and drummer Joey Yates' jittery hopscotch rhythms eventually coalesce into muscular full-group riffing. About the only thing you can say against the songs of Hives Fives is that there are not more of them. This full-scale version of Parlour fairly begs for a more suitably epic expanse of terrain, and one can only hope that it's not long before we see this group able to truly stretch their legs.","The Louisville-based instrumental outfit expands to a seven-piece.

13 & God,13 & God,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89bb1335d7bf1699305/1:1/w_160/69e73671.jpg,2005-05-05 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8288-13-god/,AnticonAlien Transistor,"13 & God is a collaboration between Weilheim, Germany's the Notwist and Berkeley, California's Themselves, marking the place where two parallel lines veer inward and converge to the sound of swelling strings and distant drumclaps. It has been a long wait. One year ago, Themselves's diabolically cerebral Doseone whet my appetite for this project in an interview: ""Those guys are just like us,"" he said of the Notwist. ""Totally collaborative and focused."" It's true; symmetries abound: Both groups released jaw-dropping albums in 2002 and followed them with several years of remixes and other projects, leaving the challenges they heralded unanswered. For the Notwist, it was Neon Golden, a splendid wash of immaculate electro-pop that was broadly adored. For Themselves, it was the The No Music, a stunted mutant of grinding robot-rap that was hard to love but easy to regard with awe for its huge ambition and relentless brutality. If the former was a sonic approximation of melancholy-tinged joie de vivre-- a delicate, fluttering thing-- the latter was an iron tank smashing everything in its path under its treads. Upon hearing of this unlikely alliance, fans could only speculate. How would Themselves's Futurist evocations of claustrophobic din, fascist visions, and post-industrial blight dovetail with the pastel hues of the Notwist's spacious laptop pop? Would integration even be possible, or would the process be more mash-up than collaboration-- Doseone gibbering maniacally and sawing sheet metal over big, lazy arcs of guitar? How can a butterfly collaborate with a machine? This improbability must be why 13 & God's debut is such a creeper, an album of broad gestures that reveal vivid, flickering details over time, its pleasures unfolding as what it actually is gradually erases speculative notions of what it might be. Two of the album's most immediately pleasureable songs also happen to be its most unabashedly ""Notwisty""-- single ""Men of Station"" and ""Perfect Speed"" wouldn't be out of place on Neon Golden. On those tracks, Themselves seem to be in lurker mode-- their most discernible contribution to ""Men of Station"" amounts to creepo nursery-school harmonies. But mostly it's Markus Acher's show-- quivering strings, a lambent piano phrase, an acoustic arpeggio and gently spitting drums create an austere foundation for his voice, as he repeats the phrase, ""We are men of station/ We are troubled and just the same/ But we're not as hell as you."" Exactly why Acher's voice is so penetrating and resonant, despite being, on the surface, rather plain and unaffected, is difficult to nail down-- something about the way he holds simple syllables in his mouth, then releases them with the slightly skewed and careful inflections of a non-native speaker, renders them unspeakably magnetic. He brings this same understated grace to the hushed burner ""Perfect Speed"". Here, an oscillating buzz sharply contrasts ping-ponging chords in a staticky slither where false endings blur into mellow sirens into dramatic re-entries, drums flogging the track restlessly around tight corners. The remainder of the album achieves a more realized synthesis of styles, and the stridency of The No Music is nowhere to be found. The members of Themselves also comprise one half of Subtle, which is as lush and sonorous as Themselves is cacophonous and stark, and 13 & God makes more sense when appraised as a collaboration between the Notwist and members of Subtle than as a Notwist/Themselves production. Keyboardist Dax Pierson (who remains hospitalized after Subtle's van crash in February) joined Themselves after the release of The No Music, and perhaps he's partially responsible for softening the ever-mercurial group's aesthetic. ""Afterclap"", for instance, with its breezy sing-along vocals, nearly atonal woodwinds, and loopy whistles, is unlike anything the Notwist or Themselves has ever produced. It's vintage g-funk gone twee, as if Dre hooked up with Nate Dogg's cardie-wearing cousin to make a song for suburban cruising in a Honda hatchback with factory speakers. ""Low Heaven"" is a seething, pneumatic wheezer tricked out with Themselves's nightmare chorus and Dose's patented multi-tracked muttering, but remains airy and light. ""Soft Atlas"" strings deliberately chiming keys over a vanishing pulse, setting the stage for Dose's most hypnotic and ramified vocal turn this side of the propulsive drone-hop of ""Tin Strong"", where he competes with Acher's chopped-up falsetto. ""Walk"" closes the record with a metamorphosing sound collage, which works well in this concise dosage and embodies what I imagined 13 & God would sound like overall. But after spending many hours wandering the elegant and diversely adorned chambers of its other songs, I'm glad that I was wrong.","Collaboration between German lap-poppers the Notwist and Anticon's Themselves, marking the place where two parallel lines veer inward and converge to the sound of swelling strings and distant drumclaps.

Lost Recordings 2000-04,The Exposures,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd055e6ef95969322f88/1:1/w_160/23bfa09f.gif,2005-05-05 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2923-lost-recordings-2000-04/,Eastern Developments,"The Exposures' ""lost recordings"" are simple, hip-hop comfort music made baffling by their liner notes. Take the ""Collage of Digital Passion"": This German trio's cutup piece could briefly cause a few eyes to blink at the hi-fi during a cocktail party or soothe a heart-broken and Nyquil-drunk soul bathed in bedroom TV glare. The ""passion"" comes from the snippets of uttered ""love"" samples that flicker in the rhythm of a bored man's remote control; a loop of a crushed-velvet R&B; ladykiller carries the piece with a ""love"" that sings to every straggler who comes in the lounge for bitters. The sauntering micro-funkiness of it all could remind one of a dazed Prefuse 73 or, for the obscurists, the acid-damaged collage of the United States of America's ""The American Way of Love"". Yet, the liner notes of Lost Recordings inform us that the ""Digital Passion"" was actually a trailer soundtrack for a special on ""sexuality and romance in digital postmodernism"" on the science TV show called ""Adventure Research"". My BS detector rings a happy song when the notes then mentioned the track had an ""aphrodisiac effect"" that apparently mutated the show's recording session into something ""akin to a sexual orgy."" Unfortunately, the Exposures' ""secret"" incident was kept in the studio vault, so we get a ""toned down"" version of what happened through our stereos or a ""vague idea of the composition's true impact."" Fair enough. What this has to do with deconstructed semantics, image, and power or whatever this week's definition of postmodernism is-- I'll get back to you on that when there is time and money. The Exposures are best remembered for being credited as a ""fictitious backing band"" on microhouse snake charmer Jan Jelinek's 2003 sleeper, La Nouvelle Pauverte. Whether Jelinek saved or robbed them is unclear: Conflicting reports tell us that he shined the light on these 25-plus year veterans by inviting them to perform on that record, while the liner notes on the group's Lost Recordings-- which compiles their obscure pieces from the past four years\xD1claim Jelinek sampled their shimmering wah-wah guitar without permission for his ""Ifs ands & Buts"". Hell, judging by the songs here, The Exposures could really be Jelinek himself in b-boy drag. Confusion aside, Scott ""Prefuse 73/Savath + Savlas/Delarosa and Asaora/Piano Overlord"" Herren is giving the Exposures their dues through his Eastern Development label. The German trio of M. Cretu, N. Gratin, and O. Grouton originally came out of an experiment in German television sometime in the late 70s. A station tried to amuse viewers with short movies between shows, instead of the usual commercial filler. They eventually spent the next two decades soundtracking films and TV shows. The results are instrumentals that take a good, digestible jazz-hop idea and loop it for three minutes with a few chord progressions to deliver the goods before they expire. The best is ""Post Crossings"", with its octopus-limbed synth riff that sounds mechanical yet oddly lyrical. ""A Machine Under Influence"" (apparently recorded live at a Volkswagen plant) is nearly as strong with its clove-smoked jazz that walks in a circle as a UFO toy beeper grows in volume and madness before cutting off. ""Sake Rock"" sounds like a distant subway ring that duets with a guitarist struggling to hit the right notes with it, while ""The Knack"" (done for a documentary about some guy who pedal-boated across the Atlantic) has a swank jazz strut that breaks its bones with every added note and snap of the sampler. ""Das Freundliche Rocksichord"" and ""Ein Lied für Frau Thyssen-Henne"" are both Polaroid snapshots of cool jazz and bossa nova grooves all bathed in a weariness aged with time and listlessness. Overall, there are so many peculiar sounds and historical contexts in Lost Recordings that a cult could very well arise around the Exposures. Yet, something tells me that there is a man behind the curtain that could surprise or disappoint many if it was opened. I mean, ""Post Crossings"" apparently grooved a TV exposé on cycle racing that sparked public outrage, a moment that the liner notes acclaim is the handiwork of ""sensational journalism, accompanied by an equally sensational band."" Do you hear a detector ringing?","Jan Jelinek-related project finds a home on Scott Herren's Eastern Developments label.

Rio Baile Funk: Favela Booty Beats,Various Artists,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84613d19756521395f7/1:1/w_160/e414b9dd.jpg,2005-05-05 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2084-rio-baile-funk-favela-booty-beats/,Essay,"A cursory listen to Rio Baile Funk: Favela Booty Beats might give you the impression that Rio de Janeiro is one big, happy ass-humping utopia, which it is, for a first-class Third World clusterfuck. Carnival is Mardi Gras-St. Patty's-Freaknik-Spring Break-Fuck Your Town Up After the Big Victory-madness. The national soccer team commands the pitch like the cast of West Side Story. Surfing, samba, white-sand beaches loaded with brown-skinned sex machines. And has anyone met an ugly Brazilian? How about a mopey one? Yeah, me neither. But if you read about the conditions in Rio's favelas-- Gestapo-y police tactics, unchecked drug trafficking, pre-teen death squads, and a mind-boggling homicide rate among people age 15-24-- poppin' that booty suddenly becomes a Thriller dance for the woefully begotten. You're forgiven if you want to ignore socio-economics and just shake your dumper because that's the real aim here. As future U.N Deputy Secretary-General Lil' Jon stated in a recent interview, ""People just like to party. The economy is fucked up. There's war going on. People don't want to think about all of that shit. People want to relieve all of that stress and tension."" In a city where the haves frolic on beaches below the hillside shantytowns of the have-nots' do morro, the party is on full blast. It's Miami circa-'86 to the Extreme down there, kids, and there are no big record contracts to save anyone from the slum. The prevailing sound of favela funk is the 808 bass. It's the basis of every song, so if you don't like it, don't bother. Some tunes color it with traditional instrumentation like the accordion-tinged ""Pavaroty"" or the horn blasts of ""Bate La Palme De Mao"", but for the most part, samples and synth flashes are just window dressing for the low end. One noticeable exception is ""Jonathan II"" which has the Mario Bros. freaking the keys like Wendy and Lisa with a kid hard-spitting Portuguese rhymes. By ""kid"", I mean a 9-year-old, and it doesn't sound like he's riffing on Iesha or at the playground, you know? He sounds pissed, which places him neatly within the oeuvre of favela mc'ing, in which the ability to sound menacing supersedes all other qualities. The most amusing example occurs on ""Toma Juizo"" when the soft-voiced member of the duo conspicuously gravels his vocal during the chorus to match the gruff of his partner. Most of Favela Booty Beats' cuts are pleasant renderings of 80s Miami bass if taken separately, but the dated and relatively tame selection robs the music of its all-out party intentions. Diplo's Favela On Blast mix approximated the vibe, and various online mp3 mixtapes are google-fresh. In comparison, RBF: FBB (like that?) feels like a Pier 1 Import of ghetto world music. With American hip-hop stomping its Goliath footprints in the world's urban ghettos throughout the last decade-- and with increasingly diverse offspring in Europe and Africa-- favela funk may be the most startling descendant. Seizing on the nihilism of gangsta rap and the escapism of Southern bass, it is a disquieting manifestation of a truly desperate faction of Brazilian society. With all that is broken in the segregated narco-slums of Rio, Sao Paolo, and the rest of Brazil's metropolises, the favelados are making the most unhinged club music on the planet. Hopefully, future compilations will better translate the feeling.","The well-received favela funk comp finally gets U.S. distribution.

Separation Sunday,The Hold Steady,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c154eb335119a49ed549/1:1/w_160/3be1f8f6.jpg,2005-05-05 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3977-separation-sunday/,Frenchkiss,"Craig Finn isn't a singer. His voice is a harsh, nasal, confused, emphatic bleat, clamping down on certain words and rolling tricky internal rhymes around in his mouth until they come out all broken. He sounds more like the sketchy drunk guy yelling in your ear at a show, asking if you know where to buy drugs, than like the frontman of the band onstage. Finn's voice may be difficult, but don't let it be a deal-breaker. Finn may not be Art Garfunkel up in this piece, but he uses his adenoidal rasp to blurt twisted, dense shards of squalid back-alley imagery and bruised druggy lamentations, broken teeth and broken bottles, and tattered hotel-room Bibles and hidden knives. He's the poet laureate of the loading dock behind the mall where the runaway kids get together to sniff cheap coke at 5 a.m. The Hold Steady's first album, last year's ...Almost Killed Me, was a tangled mess of damaged character sketches and triumphant bar-rock thump-- Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle reimagined as an epic of Russian literature. But Separation Sunday is something more, the elegiac Biblical lost-innocence junkie odyssey that Denis Johnson never wrote. Like Fiestas & Fiascos, the final album from Finn's former Minneapolis post-punk band Lifter Puller, it's an album-length story that forces us to pull bits of narrative from Finn's tangles of words. In Separation Sunday, a confused Catholic girl named Hallelujah hooks up with a motley assortment of shady characters, does a gang of drugs, gets born again when some guy with a nitrous tank dunks her in a river, wakes up in a confession booth, and maybe dies and maybe comes back from death. But the real story is in Finn's virtuoso evocations of menace (""When they say great white sharks/ They mean the kind in big black cars/ When they say killer whales/ They mean they whaled on him till they killed him up in Penetration Park""), hedonism (""You came into the ER drinking gin from a jam jar/ And the nurse is making jokes about the ER being like an after-bar""), and brief shining moments of lucidity (""Youth services always find a way to get their bloody cross into your druggy little messed-up teenage life""). None of this would work if Finn didn't have an expert rock band backing him up. Finn's songs wheel precariously from one unhinged lyrical idea to the next, almost never stopping for choruses or going out of their way to fit into any sort of structure, but the band plays these songs like long-lost fist-in-the-air classic rock anthems. It's well-schooled in every bar-rock cliché, and executes these moves with joy and conviction: the pick-slide before the climax, the weeping Hammond organ on the bridge, the pregnant pause before the big riff kicks back in. Since ...Almost Killed Me, the band has beefed up its sound with the help of Rocket From the Crypt producer Dave Gardner and keyboard player Franz Nickolay, and its Meat Loaf pianos, greasy George Thorogood blooz choogle, and wheedling Journey guitar carry more heft and authority than they had on the last album. This stuff would sound great behind just about any garage-rock hack, but it turns Finn's dirtbag chronicles into something epic and huge and molten and beautiful. ","Second album from these Brooklyn boozehounds finds them molding the reckless shoutalongs of their debut into overdriven beer-soaked party anthems. Vocalist Craig Finn comes into his own here as a lyricist, and as a sweat-drenched and drunk back-alley bawler: His brazen caterwaul may be a brief obstacle for the unprepared, but the bar band blazing behind him is a uniter (not a divider), rapturously comandeering every trick in the rock'n'roll fakebook.

Paper Tigers,Caesars,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12a5e6ef95969320115/1:1/w_160/09192b74.jpg,2005-05-05 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1714-paper-tigers/,Astralwerks,"In an age of endlessly self-devouring retro, the Caesars are triply damned. Their second U.S. release, 2003's 39 Minutes of Bliss (in an Otherwise Meaningless World), was among the most assiduous Nuggets rips of the neu-garage years, pillaging equal parts Sonics, 13th Floor Elevators, and ? and the Mysterians. To me (if not a certain website's archives), the strength of a few goofy, clever and undeniably catchy tracks-- ""Jerk It Out"", ""Sort It Out"", ""Let's Go Parking Baby""-- all but made up for the disc's unevenness. Authenticity? Dudes, Jack White never practiced in an honest-to-goodness Kennedy-era car hole, either. Now the Swedes formerly known as 12 Caesars and Caesars Palace are back just in time to cash in on Apple's embrace of ""Jerk It Out"" for the company's ubiquitous iPod commercials. Aside from that track, which recurs on Paper Tigers as a bloated remix, the band's 1960s fascination seems to have given way to a 70s power-pop fetish. Bits of Who bombast do seep into opener ""Spirit"", but fluffy jingles like ""May the Rain"" and ""Out There"" sound more like deservedly forgotten Romantics cuts. Alas, the power-pop Caesars aren't as fun as the garage-rock Caesars; rather than proclaiming a ludicrous desire to ""sniff glue/ 'Cause I can't get over you,"" they plunge into hackneyed lyrics-by-numbers about ""rivers of salty tears"" and not being able to ""go on without you"" even though ""my heart is strong."" Again, the band's backward-looking aesthetic doesn't bother me. But the bland, overproduced nothings of the Caesars' latest-- like those of fellow newfound power-poppers Tegan and Sara-- are cause for consternation. One of Paper Tigers' many whopping clichés, ""It's Not the Fall That Hurts"", is still catchy enough to match the stupid fun of 39 Minutes' best moments. But the rest of the album is merely a blur of unimaginative song fragments layered with heavy echo and the remnants of the band's original guitar fuzz. I liked it better when they sounded like Smashmouth. Wait, did I say ""triply""? I meant Tripoli. Nah, just kidding, here's the kicker: Even as the Caesars' best-known song is an icon of the iPod revolution, their new album is a throwback to the very business model that spawned Napster and its descendants. Yes: Like the multi-platinum '90s abominations that turned the biggest music lovers into the industry's most wanted, Paper Tigers is one or two decent singles surrounded by a bunch of mediocre-or-worse filler. Now that's retro.","First Jet, then U2, and now this...OK, so the iPod's not perfect.

Bergen's Datarock are about as dick-in-ass as it gets-- gayer than Guided By Voices, maybe even gayer than the Boo Radleys. And the best part is I don't even think these dudes fuck! One-time Annie-collaborating Fredrik Saroea, according to the band's site, has a girlfriend (relax, it's not Annie), and Ketil Mosnes, the other guy, ""is single but chances are big he is either too drunk or in a bad mood."" Whatever, Saroea writes all the lyrics, and chances are big I've made all this stuff up anyway. The point is that gay disco-- which is what this fabulous duo pump out with strong accents of Madchester-via-Röyksopp, Sparks, and the Talking Heads-- continues to become aestheticized and genrefied, an autonomous vocabulary of licks and entendres entirely divorced from the sexual proclivities of the artist. Brown licenses are public property-- all your gays are belong to us. The challenge: Are Datarock kitsch? Are they campy like Scissor Sisters? How do Datarock want to be received with lyrics like ""Get on my hands and knees/ On your command I'll freeze"" or songs like ""Nightflight to Uranus"", where ""Uranus"" is ""your anus"" and the rest is all ""We're gonna give and then we'll receive"" sorta stuff? Are they funny ha ha, or Funny Ha Ha? Reception's everything, sure fine okay, and musically the songs pack enough jabs for all you ""I don't listen to lyrics"" and ""I only like hip-hop for dancing"" types. But just something as quick as that Boney M flip above, or the twisted call-and-response on ""Computer Camp Love"" -- Datarock must know they're working within and challenging a genre to some extent, so I don't think it's fair to say all their cock talk is for knee jerks or without greater motivation. Enough snorkling though, I need to tell you about these really awesome songs-- all total energy thing, with at least two or three solid curveball hooks amidst the feet fodder. Datarock jump around a bit stylistically, borrowing David Byrne's affectations, his band's jingle-jangle guitar lines even more so. That said, Datarock scrap together an identity across the album with (a) the aforementioned art-gayness and (b) live drums over drum machine production, with the balance leaning closer to the synthier side of things even on the album's rougher Sloppy Mondays moments, like the massive romp ""I Used To Dance With My Daddy"". Datarock have a song that riffs off of Maybelline cosmetics (""Maybe she's born with it"") with the amount of space !!! went after with varying success on Louden Up Now, and ""Laurie"" could pass for one of those lap-rock songs we might get from one of those Plus/Minus type bands, (except it's actually good). There's never a bottom line with bands like this, but the bottom line with Datarock is the songs shoot for instant pleasure and accidentally end up being much more than that.

Doughty's recent solo work has been mostly acoustic singer/songwriter stuff, but Haughty Melodic isn't so intimate-- picture last year's re-released Skittish backed by the Dave Matthews band, and you'll have a good idea of what this record sounds like. It's full of jam-band percussion, vanilla-funk basslines, and the occasional strings and horns, played with an affected worldliness that nearly erases all of Doughty's idiosyncrasies. If you're searching the tracklist for hints of Doughty's quirky humor, ""Busting Up a Starbucks"" isn't quite satire, just the smug finger-pointing title and some name-checking, along with lyrics like ""This bitter drink/ Has got you drunk/ The thoughts you think/ Become unthunk"". ""Tremendous Brunettes"" features Dave Matthews himself in a jaunty duet about being surrounded by women and unable to get laid-- something I'm sure to which Matthews, one of the highest-paid singers in the country, can relate. ""Starbucks"" is an old song to Doughty and his fans, featured on his Smofe + Smang live record from 2002-- as were others such as ""Madeline and Nine"". However, you have to dig through the impenetrable harmlessness of the instrumentation to discover the melancholy lyrics of ""Sunken-Eyed Girl"" or ""Grey Ghost"" and hear what makes them worthwhile. While these older songs get closer to the heart of Doughty's circular, rhythmic guitar playing and unique phrasing, the mediocre adult-contempo melodies on ""Looking at the World From a Bottom of a Well"" or ""Unsingable Name"" aren't much of a payoff. But I keep coming back to the sparse, sincere ""White Lexus"", with lyrics about disowning the thrill of riding in a luxury car-- or the thrill of seeing who's driving it, alleviating his isolation-- over some acoustic strumming and a bit of pedal steel guitar. It's here that Doughty hits a real note of yearning, revealing an ordinary desire and the complicated reasons for hiding it. Not coincidentally, this is the record's most minimalist moment. The problem here isn't that Doughty isn't as malleable (or faceless) as artists like Matthews; his material sinks or swims on his personality, with light-hearted wit or disarming personal candor. Haughty Melodic is lacking in both. Doughty is better off when laid bare or with a group of musicians that push him in new directions, rather than ones who simply back him.","Latest release from the former Soul Coughing singer.

Remixes: Four Tet / Remixes: Koushik,Madvillain,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c459ea9e61561daa811d/1:1/w_160/22567f2b.gif,2005-05-04 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11783-remixes-four-tet-remixes-koushik/,Stones Throw,"On several occasions last year, I was slighty thrown by the curious ambient intro to Madvillainy opener ""Illest Villains"". Before giving way to a Pink Panther-style bassline and some patently brilliant vocal sampling, the bubbling 10-second prelude to 2004's most accomplished hip-hop disc doesn't sound like hip-hop at all. The blippy pulse kind of sounds like static from some interplanetary radio station. It kind of sounds like Four Tet, who proves to be quite the unconventional rap producer on his tag team effort with that cagey masked marauder MF Doom. Originally slated to drop last summer soon after the release of Madvillainy, these remix EPs were delayed at first due to creative feeling-out and nitpicking. Both Doom and Madlib wanted to tweak a couple of the remixes and-- thanks to their famously-hectic schedules-- the wait inevitably snowballed. After a botched test pressing, the songs finally broke free recently, albeit only on iTunes (due to contractual fine-print, these mixes will only get a physical release in Europe on wax). Still, the downtime has its benefits: With more distance between the originals and the new mixes, it's easier to consider these tracks on their own, and they'll inevitably have you going back to the source with a refreshed, slightly skewed perspective. Four Tet mastermind Kieran Hebden may not be the most obvious choice to take on such classic material but, based on his six-song collection, he's an inspired pick. Although psych-scratching Stone Thrower Koushik would seem like a more suitable candidate on paper, it's Hebden's far-reaching reimaginings (""remix"" doesn't quite do these painstaking tracks justice) that truly impress. Employing his trademark free-jazz-inspired, electro-acoustic patterns, the laptop guru amasses small armies of saxophone squawks and looping synths all marching to some of the hardest drums he's ever programmed. Ever the sonic neat-freak, Hebden somehow tames his cacophonies and makes everything bump like a batch of Interstellar Coltrane-approved boom-bap. Though best known for his laid-back Volvo-ad-ready beat-suites, Hebden's always had traces of Shadow-esque hip-hop soaked into his background fabrics. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Hebden was a big Madvillain supporter early on. Nearly a year before Madvillainy's official release, he was praising retarded hard copies in a self-penned Pitchfork Artist List: ""MF Doom also has a record coming out with Madlib soon,"" he wrote in May 2003, ""[it's] so good I pretty much shit my pants every time I hear it."" The guy's Doom obsession obviously borders on near-stalker levels, and his familiarity with Madlib's original thunder proves invaluable. Hebden's focused instrumentals strip away any and all sonic traces of Lib's ashed-out, quick-fix soul, but they match the West Coast beatminer's unflappable adventurousness. Paired with Doom's jigsaw narratives, Hebden doesn't necessarily improve upon the original tracks as much as he offers a supplemental shade of depth to a much-loved masterwork. Both physically and stylistically, Hebden and Doom make an odd couple ripe with ""hilarious"" buddy-cop potential. In the passenger seat sits a hunched-over laptop guru who's known to perform with a glowing Banzai tree next to his console, and driving the wheel (and chomping the donuts, of course) is Doom's most-blunted, beer-bellied dictionary-snob. The free-form mood is set from the beginning as opener ""Meat Grinder"" twitches and spurts for a good 30 seconds of utter randomness. A lazy clarinet surfaces at one point. Cut up saxophones share their confusion with pulsating factory noises. Then Hebden cracks the beat and acts as pied piper to the aural odds and ends, which quickly fall in line and suddenly make total sense. It's like a Magic Eye poster for the ears. ""Money Folder"" gets the banger treatment, drums train-clacking across the speakers over a sinister synth line. And, of course, Hebden takes full advantage of Doom's ""old jazz standard"" break invitation, setting off an entire Ornette Coleman symphony. The most intriguing track is ""Great Day,"" where the producer translates Madlib's lackadaisical stroll into a brooding patchwork of whizzing acoustic guitar effects that gently bend against the beat's downtempo grain. Lines like ""It's easy as Pi, three point one four/ One more one false move and they done for,"" take on a new gloomy resonance as the track turns Doom's peculiar boasts into those of a sullen bully with a conscience. Psychedelic mish-mash DJ Koushik's eight-track EP runs just under 10 minutes long, staying true to Madvillain's haphazard punk-rock pace. He goes lengths to emulate Madvillainy's canny blend of comic-book-inspired dialogue (Dr. Doom creator Stan Lee pops in, pontificating in his unmistakable growl, ""You can not be arrested for wanting to conquer the world-and that's all that Doom wants."") and loose, soulful loops. Flutes float in and out of ""Strange Ways"" and cooing back-ups help ""Curls"" find a decent groove, but most tracks fly by at such a quick clip, they hardly leave an impression. More of a logical continuation than a total revamp, Koushik's EP is competent, but doesn't add anything new to Doom and Lib's wily formula, ultimately reading like an engaging-but-kinda-empty Cliff's Notes version. Since he's working with everyone from Danger Mouse to Ghostface nowadays, is it too early to propose a full-fledged DoomTet long player? Then he can move onto a DualDisc collabo with Animal Collective and Will Oldham. Make it happen, Doom.","Four Tet and Koushik each remix Madvillainy tracks on this pair of iTunes- and vinyl-only EPs.

Talking Voice vs. Singing Voice,Starflyer 59,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a541c0084474cd0c0699/1:1/w_160/8ae0e99e.jpg,2005-05-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7464-talking-voice-vs-singing-voice/,Tooth and Nail,"Although their extensive career should absolve the group from such narrow-minded cataloging, the ""Christian band"" label still burdens indie vets Starflyer 59. Despite their best rebuttals (""We're Christians in a band, not a Christian band!""), the tag's stuck, and after nine studio albums, what's it matter anymore? Frontman Jason Martin must've been one of those precocious Sunday schoolers who looked past the bake sales and finger painting to realize how depressing Bible stories actually can be. His slick yet downcast shoegazer ditties have established the group's spirituality as more in step with ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"" than ""Jesus Loves Me"", a pathos critical in distinguishing Starflyer from more popular, albeit extinct, bible-thumping rockers (R.I.P. Jars of Clay, Creed). After a misguided attempt to revive their mid-90s classic rock sound on I Am the Portuguese Blues, the band finds a more appropriate medium to project their soporific melancholia. Talking Voice vs. Singing Voice picks up where 2003's Old left off, mixing Bossanova-era Pixies surf guitar with breathy, Nyquil-induced vocals and, despite whittling down to a mere two members, the band produces their biggest sounding album to date. Old's discreet violin parts expand to grandiose string ensembles on Talking Voice while fluffy production dulls Starflyer's staple lo-fi, sharp-edged guitar sound. Always the New Order aficionado, Martin fully realizes his love for 80's electro-pop on songs like ""The Contest Completed"" and ""Good Sons"". We're not talking Killers-style new wave pandering here, just some playful synth tinkering and a few electronic drumbeats where gritty garage instruments used to be. One of the few uptempo moments on the album, ""Good Sons"" spontaneously combusts after a downtrodden verse, flashing sugary synth leads and a potpourri of drum machine blips reminiscent of ""Bizarre Love Triangle"". While not as fun, religiously charged closer ""The Longest Line"" mashes strings, guitars, synths and drum loops into one multi-layered pulp, sounding part-Duran Duran, part-Billy Graham with lyrics like ""Got one destination/ For Jesus to call me home"". Unfortunately a return to the sound of Old also means a return to Starflyer's Radiohead imitation, which more accurately sounds like an imitation of Hood's Radiohead mimicry. Martin's lyrics aren't interesting enough to warrant acoustic elegies like ""Softness, Goodness"" and ""A Good Living"", and he deploys hackneyed religious lyrics where Thom Yorke would launch an anti-Bush philippic. Sure, they overestimate their modest songwriting's allure, and yeah, Martin's vocals are perpetually set to an unflappable, emotionless ""coo"". Still, after nine diverse albums, these guys consistently churn out solid sleepy-eyed, mid-tempo indie rock, which helps make the sentimental spirituality easier to stomach.","This LP picks up where 2003's Old left off, mixing Bossanova-era Pixies surf guitar with breathy, Nyquil-induced vocals.

Cold Roses,Ryan AdamsThe Cardinals,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0039d034d5c69bf25f8/1:1/w_160/41c3458e.jpg,2005-05-03 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/42-cold-roses/,Lost Highway,"In late 2001, Ryan Adams was inadvertently anointed the face-du-jour for ""alt-country,"" an idea scraped off the ink-smeared pages of No Depression and tremulously shot into semi-mainstream consciousness by an over-jubilant, rural-romanticizing press: Adams' ""breakthrough"" record, Gold, turned out to be a lot more alt-rock than alt-country, and its proper, non-demo follow-up, 2003's spastic Rock N Roll, ditched the pedal steel altogether, embracing, instead, overblown riffs and smarmy vocal mugging. Cold Roses, which follows two weepy acoustic EPs (2003's Love Is Hell Parts One and Two), sees Adams trudging back to his country roots, turning up the twang, curling his cowboy boots into cold, east village pavement, and transforming his frantic yawps into star-fed cries. Even for Adams' most zealous fans, hunting down new material has never been a particularly pressing concern: The two-disc Cold Roses is one of (a vaguely audacious) three full-length releases planned for 2005 (Jacksonville City Nights is slated to arrive this summer, with 29 expected in the fall), and while Adams has never been an especially sharp judge of his own work, Cold Roses suffers considerably from its double-disc conceit. Overstuffed and vaguely monotonous, the album could be easily whittled down to a single sequence of impressive songs; Instead, it's a meandering, occasionally moving series of mid-tempo laments, some more memorable than others. Despite ample backing by the Cardinals (guitarists J.P. Bowersock and Cindy Cashdollar, drummer Brad Pemberton, and bassist Catherine Popper; with singer-songwriter Rachael Yamagata, formerly of Chicago's Bumpus, taking guest turns on ""Cold Roses"" and ""Let It Ride""), Cold Roses doesn't feel particularly collaborative; followers of Adams' solo work will recognize loads of parallels to Adams' post-Whiskeytown, 2000 solo debut, Heartbreaker (minus the punk throwdowns). Cold Roses' most palpable reference point may be American Beauty-era Grateful Dead: Excellent opener ""Magnolia Mountain"" mixes slow, ""Box of Rain"" melancholy (""If the morning don't come/ Will you lie to me?/ Will you take me to your bed and lay me down?"") with Adams' trademark guitar scrapes and sandpapered howls, while ""Cold Roses"" is packed with giddy guitar noodling and jam-friendly interludes (even Adams' vocals seem deliberately Garcia-infused, straining and paper-thin, careening off into a smoke-filled sunset.) Meanwhile, nearly every bit of electric guitar on Cold Roses sounds as though it was plucked straight from Dick's vault, all wiggly solos and playful licks, unintentional and woozy. Lead single ""Let It Ride"" bounces, proudly shuffling through a laundry-list of country requirements: whining steel guitar, longing mentions of Tennessee and Carolina, nods to the Cumberland River and ferryboats, big, lonesome wails. But ""Let It Ride"" also employs plenty of weird, Ennio Morricone-inspired western guitar whirls, and Adams' coaxing vocals are undeniable, charmingly sincere and innocent: The resulting song is properly engaging, more classic country than alt-anything. ""Cherry Lane"" employs honky-tonk yawping and girl-gone words (""The glass/ It hits the floor"" is accompanied by requisite glass-shattering sound effects), while the preciously titled ""How Do You Keep Love Alive"" mopes along, wearied and oddly pretty, half-sung over a languishing piano line. Adams' songwriting proclivities have always flirted with MOR, adult-alternative sappiness, but for the most part, Cold Roses is clever and uncommonly listenable, far less bombastic and contrived than its predecessor. Even lyrically, Adams is modest and cautiously confessional, careful to avoid the cocky caterwauling that invades much of his back catalogue. Tellingly, Cold Roses is the first Ryan Adams record not to feature a picture of him on the cover; it's increasingly difficult to say exactly when Adams transitioned from bloated media darling to scrappy underdog, but it happened, and he commandeered the passage all by himself, squirming away from the overblown antics of yesteryear and embracing, instead, the staid earnestness of his roots. It's a welcome return.","The prickly singer/songwriter is a little more country than rock'n'roll on this 2xCD effort, which was recorded with a backup group called the Cardinals and features vocal contributions from Rachel Yamagata.

In Case We Die,Architecture in Helsinki,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19bc0084474cd0bfe4b/1:1/w_160/c5d807d3.jpg,2005-05-03 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/441-in-case-we-die/,BarNoneTailem Bend,"Call it the Fickle Revolution. An increasing number of indie bands appear to be absorbing the channel-hopping, micro-editing, multitasking pace of our ADD generation, flitting amongst styles and sounds like a middle-schooler tries out different cultural identities. As opposed to the genre-casserole cookbooks that glutted the late 90s in the long shadow of one Beck Hansen, this trend seems to be more about keeping the peas, chicken alfredo, and biscuit strictly sequestered on different parts of the plate, while still packing them all into a single track. Borrowing the love of segues and multi-part suites from prog while leaving behind (most of) the muso wank, this branch of indie rock seems to be fighting its complacency with complexity, replacing calculated non-chalance with giddy ambition. Last year's flag-wavers for this trend were the Fiery Furnaces, whose Blueberry Boat revived the untapped ""A Quick One While He's Away"" story-song format for a surprisingly divisive audience. Though the Furnaces don't seem willing to relinquish their leadership role-- what with stacks of new material all set to be released in the coming year-- the hot prospect on the scene just might be Architecture in Helsinki, an eight-member Australian outfit bursting with the same ecstatic impatience and pretentious-pop charm. It pains my soul to so tightly tether a band's image to that of another, but AiH utilize a very similar approach to making music (if in tighter, briefer packages than the Furnaces), and will likely provoke reactions along the same love-it-or-loathe-it battle lines. Where Architecture in Helsinki hold an advantage, however, is in sheer size, with eight members contributing on a Santa-long list of instruments, producing a sound like a third-grade music class let loose in a music instrument warehouse. Most of the band's members also contribute vocals to In Case We Die, creating a vocal spectrum to match the instrumental diversity: off-tune twee, standard-issue indie-boy/girl croon, congregational harmonies, all-male military choral chants. These elements give Architecture in Helsinki multiple palette combinations to try, and to their credit, In Case We Die tries as many as humanly possible in 12 tracks and 40 minutes. Take the title track, which (of course!) contains a parenthetical ""parts 1-4"" on the listing. Part 1 opens with electronic shimmers reminiscent of their smaller-canvas debut, Fingers Crossed, but surfeited with random percussion including rather Smile-esque saws and hammers. Shift suddenly to Part 2, where strings and horns flare briefly before giving way to a Stringman solo. Part 3 contains a rather Arcade Fire unison-chorus vocal, complete with field recordings of a fireworks show. And Part 4 eases us back down with a minute of indie slow-dance, complete with angelic backing singers and what sounds like a French horn solo. Oh, did I mention all this takes place in 3:33? Architecture in Helsinki's unwillingness to decide what kind of band they are is their most endearing quality, forcing them through multiple metamorphoses within each song-- like ""The Fly"" in fast-forward. At the core, one could probably most easily pound them into the square hole of twee-pop, but I haven't heard too many twee bands so convinced that they can pull off a spastic dance segment (""Nevereverdid""), or make a two-minute symphony about math (""It's 5!""), or effortlessly build a song from a simple electro beat to a brassy peak Beulah would be jealous of-- and, oh yeah, use some sitar and psychedelic a capella while they're at it (""Do the Whirlwind""). What passes for straightforward, in songs like ""The Cemetery"" and ""Wishbone"" is still delivered at three-espresso pace, with enough mic-swapping and instrument-switching to make me imagine their live show looks like an Olympic event. OK, I could spend another 600 words just diagramming the various twists and turns within the shockingly short boundaries of In Case We Die, but it's a lot better to listen than to read. All the same, don't be surprised if you experience a little dizziness, or a little frustration, as every catchy melody on this disc (and there are dozens) tends to arrive and depart faster than a subway train. Armed with more ideas than should probably be legal, Architecture in Helsinki can't be bothered to dwell for too long on any one of them, and it's this fickle nature that will make you either adore them or deplore them. ","The Aussie octet's latest LP is reminiscent of the ecstatic impatience and pretentious-pop charm of the Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat and Animal Collective's Sung Tongs, with multiple metamorphoses within each song-- albeit in tighter, briefer packages than the Furnaces-- and a diverse, expansive sonic palate.

Shinutokiwa Betsu,Wha-ha-ha,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaa4b1335d7bf16996dc/1:1/w_160/ebb3e9ea.gif,2005-05-03 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8786-shinutokiwa-betsu/,ColumbiaColumbia,"During the early 1980s in Japan-- where information and culture from the West flowed steadily, but without much segregation-- things could seem pretty confusing to an outsider. Wha-ha-ha were a originally a trio formed by saxophonist Akira Sakata (who gets around, playing recently with Jim O'Rourke), and over time, featuring some of the best jazz players in Japan. They never released any studio records outside of Japan, but in 1984, Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears) released a compilation of their music on his ReR imprint, and the band found a modest following among RIO and avant-prog fans in the West. However, Cutler's ""rock in opposition"" tag doesn't really begin to describe what they sounded like: I hear bits of jazz and fusion, placed alongside goofy cartoon voices, dub production, primitive computer music, new wave, and what would work very well as the soundtrack to Star Blazers. It sounds as if the whole ""lineage"" of Western pop only ever happened as a jumbled, nonsensical arrangement of events, with no attention paid to their order or significance. Shinutokiwa Betsu was Wha-ha-ha's first record, and has been reissued by Columbia Japan (you can get it via Forced Exposure, along with their second album). Longtime fans of Japanese experimental music will recognize Sakata, though drummer Shuichi ""Ponta"" Murakami has played with most of the biggest names in Japanese jazz and keyboard player Chino Shuichi played with Otomo Yoshihide-- not to mention guest percussionist Kiyohiko Senba, leader of the excellent Haniwa All-Stars. Wha-ha-ha's rhythm-heavy (or more accurately, jittery pulse-heavy) approach is best heard on tracks like ""On the Floor"", with the vocalist known only as Mishio providing a scat-operatic, wordless melody under a quick, ska-inflected beat and frenetic piano asides from Chino. And it really does sound like a typical Saturday morning in my house, circa 1984. ""Inanaki"" begins with a an ominous, anticipatory synth patter before launching into some seriously spaced-out speed-wave, like the ""Star Trek"" theme gone manic disco. And really, we all have our paths in life to follow, but I sincerely hope yours includes the ""Star Trek"" theme gone disco. ""My Happiness (Is Not Yours)"" trades ""Star Trek"" for a documentary on how hydrogen atoms bond at the Atomic Café, or some such concept so over-the-top silly/nerdy that it demands my undivided attention. Everything happens so quickly, and with such precision, you'd be forgiven for missing the little details, like Sakata's distant, discordant sax solos in between verses, or the silent break in the middle, when the band stops down to catch its collective breath until Sakata screams a command at them, and they jump right back into the ""bop-ba-ba!"" refrain. ""Kohmori"" is calmer, and sounds to me at times like mood music for a Japanese cocktail lounge, interspersed with more active forays into calypso-jazz-royal fanfares and soprano a cappella ""ah-ah-ahhhh"". Wha-ha-ha released three albums in total, the third of which hasn't been reissued yet. Fans of more later Japanese bands like Harpy, After Dinner, or the jazzier parts of Japanophile John Zorn's Naked City should get a kick out of Shinutokiwa Betsu, though it's lighthearted in a way Naked City never was. Still, I imagine this record stands out today just as much as it did in 1981-- ultimately, eccentric cartoon music is its own reward.","Jazz and fusion are placed alongside goofy cartoon voices, dub production, primitive computer music, and new wave on the reissue of this 1981 album.

In 2015, a compilation of their highlights will be worth buying. In 2005, their albums really aren't, unless you have a big place in your heart for Bob Wratten's super-fey indie pop and that place wasn't already filled by his work with Field Mice. It should be noted that everything on this album sounds nice; it's well-recorded, well-mixed, well-performed-- hell, it's even well-packaged-- but it has little spark and a bad habit of insisting on five-minute songs. Wratten and friends make listening a chore with crawling, dull songs like ""One Prayer Answere"", a drag with cello, acoustic guitar and sleepy, barely melodic vocals. There are a lot of songs here like this, and I'd say they formed the backbone of this album, if this album had any backbone at all. Like I said earlier, the highlights are quite bright, but there are just a few of them in the offing and outside of these sparkling moments, it's strictly bedtime. It took me a few listens to realize that ""Last Port of Call"" is a pretty nice song, surrounded as it is by its drag-ass cousins, but its laid-back lilt and memorable melody make it stand out-- even if it is twice as long as it should be. ""Helen Reddy"" gets things started with a sweet fake-out, sweeping along at a swift tempo with the sweet vocals of a bandmember credited only as Beth leading the way-- it almost reminds me of Pale Saints, actually, and it got me excited for what was to follow. I should have known better, because Wratten pulled this exact trick on the last TBS album, Alive to Every Smile, leading off with a stunner only to retreat to somnambulant quietude on the rest of the disc. ""The Sea Is So Quiet"" also picks up the pace and is similarly rewarding-- Wratten's melodies aren't exactly hook-laden, so sometimes it takes a snappy drum beat and some chorused guitar to drive them home, which is the case here. Two of the four songs tacked on after the album's proper running order (it's telling that they're referred to as ""extra tracks"" and not ""bonus tracks"") seem to realize this, but by then, the album's runtime has bloated to an arduous 75 minutes. These songs all feel like they should burst and go somewhere, but none of them do. Even a sense of economy-- say, allowing no song to last more than the two or three minutes-- could have improved this, but by the time I get a third of the way through, all I want to do is stop listening to it. Wait 'til 2015.","Latest release from Bob Wratten's post-Field Mice indie pop band.

They've recorded some of the most excitingly innovative British pop of the past decade, and yet their sound is also instantly familiar: heir to the Beach Boys' endless California summers and the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour-era psychedelia, prone to Orbital-like electronica eruptions, and as musically omnivorous as David Bowie. The 'Fork archives are littered with encomia to these Welshmen's greatness. As we suspected all along, their influences sound mighty nice, too. The Super Furries' installment in DMC's Under the Influence series-- previously curated by the likes of Morrissey, Paul Weller, and Ian Brown-- reflects the band's sprawling landscape of sonic reference. The obvious suspects (the Beach Boys, Electric Light Orchestra) make appearances, but they're surrounded by funk, house, dancehall and, gulp, opera. In the wake of similar compilations like Grandaddy's Below the Radio, The Trip and Back to Mine series, and Optimo's How to Kill the DJ [Part Two]-- not to mention Now! That's What I Call Music-- SFA's picks bolster the case that the iPod age hasn't killed the mixtape, after all. Several tracks should be required listening: Sly and the Family Stone's ""Family Affair"", MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"", and of course, the Beach Boys' shimmering ""Feel Flows"", originally from 1971's then-underrated Surf's Up. However, this compilation also boasts a memorable rarity or two. For instance, it includes to my knowledge the first CD release (aside from a 2003, similarly SFA-culled Mojo comp) of Dennis Wilson's lush 1970 B-side ""Lady"". The band's five members each contribute three selections to the effort, adding to the disc's diversity. Singer Gruff Rhys turns in some of the superest, furriest choices, representing Wales with the skewed, Left Banke-like chamber-pop of the Gorky's Zygotic Minci stalker ballad ""Christina"" and some minimalist Welsh-language synth-rock by Datblygu that wouldn't be out of place on Rhys's recent solo album. Drummer Dafydd Ieuan turns in ELO's mini-epic ""Telephone Line"", which is practically an SFA template. Predictably, keyboardist Cian Ciárán is responsible for a couple of electronic club-thumpers, Humanoid's ""Stakker Humanoid"" and Joey Beltram's ""Energy Flash"". But he also throws in the disc's classical number, Bizet's ""Pearl Fishers"". Underworld's ""Rez"", which beeps almost exactly like my girlfriend's alarm clock, was one of Ieuan's picks. It promises to be a Super Furry year: A singles compilation and Rhys's solo album came out (how do you say ""dropped"" in Welsh?) earlier in 2005, several of the band's finest records have just been reissued, and a new full-length is on the way. It remains to be seen where the Super Furries, now more than a decade old, intend to go next.

"World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing; the Funky, Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84513d19756521395f4/1:1/w_160/81154ca3.gif,2005-05-03 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2083-world-psychedelic-classics-3-loves-a-real-thing-the-funky-fuzzy-sounds-of-west-africa/,V2Luaka Bop,"Without West African music, we wouldn't have pop as we know it. The rhythms of African traditional music and the storytelling craft of traveling griots-- relatives of the early bluesmen-- form a huge part of the ancestral basis for jazz, blues, and, by extension, rock'n'roll, reggae, and all of their modern counterparts. The modern world is a cultural vortex, sweeping disparate strands into new forms, and in the 20th century all of the musical descendants of Africa's rhythmic past-- originally spread through scattered Diaspora by the slave trade-- came flooding back to Africa cross-pollinated with European compositional traditions. In the wake of independence, many young musicians felt the need to break free from the styles their parents had danced to and invent something of their own. It was the 1960s, and ample inspiration flowed in on vinyl from the West, as did instruments, amplifiers, and recording equipment. Psychedelia, soul, and funk are words we use to broadly describe music, but they're almost intentionally open-ended-- and all three were global phenomena in the 1960s and 70s. African musicians reared on highlife and Cuban rhumba considered them as a unified palette, drawing freely from each as well as their own traditions to create the styles we know today-- Afrobeat, mbalax, soukous, benga, mbaqanga, and so on. The variety of sounds is staggering, and most of it is still waiting to be discovered outside of Africa. With such a huge amount of music and so little means of hearing it, we have to turn to compilations to help us find our way into it and thankfully the range of choices is currently growing steadily. The latest chance to get your feet wet comes courtesy of David Byrne's Luaka Bop label, in the third installment of their excellent World Psychedelic Classics series and the first to feature a range of artists rather than focusing on just one. Love's a Real Thing draws from across West Africa, focusing on the thrilling juncture of Africa's musical history where experimentation was the rule and Africa, unbeknownst to most Westerners, experienced its own psychedelic era, complete with attendant social upheaval, flared pants, fluorescent colors, odd hairdos, and generation gap. The songs here run a good gamut from the relatively conservative Afro-Cuban groove of No. 1 de No. 1 (the name presumably means ""best of the best"") to the flailing, heavy acid-funk of Ofo the Black Company. The disc starts with a single smack of a snare drum, which sets Orchestra Poly-Rhythmo de Cotonou Dahomey's ""Minsato Le, Mi Dayihome"" off and running with snaking guitars and jerking rhythms. Benin's best musical export are credited here without the ""T.P."" prefix they usually affixed to their name, an acronym for ""tout pouissant,"" French for ""all-mighty"" and not at all a misnomer. Unlike most Afropop compilations, which tend to focus on one country or a specific sound, this one revels in veering back and forth between Anglo and Francophone countries, tossing heavy funk in with British Invasion-tinged soul and conga-heavy neo-traditional psych in an intentional display of stylistic breadth. They've dug up some real gems, too, such as the title track, by Gambia's Super Eagles, a ripping soul/Britpop song full of sinewy guitar lines and dueling lead vocalists. Moussa Doumbia's ""Keleya"" takes the organ-heavy sound of the Malian hotel bands and throttles it with a gruff vocal attack, while Sorry Bamba's ""Porry"" is a brilliant, spacious Saharan riff on Cuban son, swimming in organ and stately Andalusian horns. Cameroon's Manu Dibango is an African funk superstar, but the track they've chosen here, the closing theme to his soundtrack for the Senegalese film Ceddo, is an odd, inspired choice, surrounding traditional African marimba with a slow funk burn for an ultimately majestic instrumental. Nigerian William Onyeabor's ""Better Change Your Mind"" is a synth-slathered prog-funk killer whose title refers not to changing an opinion so much as an entire mindset, reaching for a decidedly flower power-ish ideal of international harmony and cooperation. Even with all the variety, there's not a weak selection here, nor anything that feels out of place. A glorious eclecticism is one of the defining characteristics of African popular music in its 1970s golden era, so it's entirely appropriate for a compilation like this to turn on a dime with every track. Beyond that, this offers plenty of other accoutrements like informative liner notes and a multimedia video for ""Minsato Le, Mi Dayihome"", not to mention the fact that only two of these songs are currently in print anywhere else. Simply put, this is a fantastic introduction to a broad range of vintage West African sounds, and one that's likely to please both devoted followers of African music and curiosity-seekers alike.","Luaka Bop compiles ""the funky, fuzzy sounds of West Africa.""

Celebration Castle,The Ponys,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a174c0084474cd0bfdee/1:1/w_160/80ecfb03.jpg,2005-05-02 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6539-celebration-castle/,In the Red,"On their much-heralded 2004 debut album Laced With Romance, Chicago-based quartet the Ponys proved fluent in an addictive and distinct strain of garage rock, primarily that of Standells/Seeds-style 60s rave-ups as refracted through the wiry late-70s vintage punk of acts like the Undertones or Richard Hell and the Voidoids. On their follow-up, Celebration Castle, the group has updated its crib-sheet's timeline to further include moody 80s post-punk, drawing references to Joy Division, Sonic Youth c. Evol, and the propulsive jangle of early R.E.M. As with all great garage rock bands, however, the Ponys perform their shameless pillaging with such dexterity and stylish swagger that they've virtually rendered themselves immune to accusations of unoriginality. Whether or not any of their ideas are actually new feels irrelevant, and the only pertinent questions to ask regarding Celebration Castle are does the band make these borrowed sounds their own, and does it sound good? To which the only possible answers must be, respectively, without question and shit yeah. Produced by Steve Albini, Celebration Castle is one of the cleanest and often straight-up prettiest-sounding albums from the In the Red label. Having toured almost constantly throughout 2004, the Ponys' playing here is taut and immaculately cohesive, and appropriately the album sports an engaging live-in-the-studio production. Leading off with ""Glass Conversation"", a chiming guitar duel whose hypnotic soar nearly recalls classic Savage Republic, Celebration Castle works quickly through an impeccable set of songs with few excess moves. As on their debut, the oddly affected, semi-British vocals of singer-guitarist Jered Gummere continue to evoke those of Richard Hell, and here the group makes more judicious use of Farfisa, using it to provide strategic atmosphere as they make frequent use of additional guitars. This approach is particularly effective on tracks like the vibrantly melodic ""Another Wound,"" or the pulsing, atmospheric ""We Shot the World"", a song whose central riff persistently threatens to morph into ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" without actually managing to do so. Other highlights include ""She's Broken"", which features an impressively forceful vocal turn from bassist Melissa Elias, and the closing ""Ferocious"", a consistently electrifying track that essentially serves as a concise summary of all things good in rock, especially as its primal thump gradually gives way a gorgeous sprawl of overdriven guitar. As with all of Celebration Castle's best moments, it's a performance spell-binding enough to have even the grouchiest garage connoisseur ready to forgive the Ponys their every trespass.","Sophomore effort from Chicago quartet finds them updating their crib-sheet to include moody 80s post-punk and indie rock, drawing references to Joy Division, Evol-era Sonic Youth, and the propulsive jangle of early R.E.M.

Copycat Killers,Cobra Verde,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e1ea9e61561daa5478/1:1/w_160/d1e82875.jpg,2005-05-02 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1728-copycat-killers/,Scat,"Cobra Verde's reason for releasing a covers record is ""the band just wanted to explore new hi-fi recording techniques by experimenting on other people's guinea pigs."" In the wake of Guided By Voices' dissolution-- and the band's increased spotlight after 2003's Easy Listening-- it's difficult not to read that as a copout. Still, if you're in the mood for some glam-rock fun, Copycat Killers picks a diverse set of songs and pushes the band's sound into new territory. Like many covers albums, there's some inspired reinterpretations, some predictable retreads of the band's influences, and some duds. The Rolling Stones' ""Play With Fire"" is a stunning surprise, transformed into a beatnik drum circle and injected with Nick Cave-level creepiness. It's the pop songs that raise eyebrows the highest, however, and not just for token kicks: Pink's ""Get the Party Started"" ducks the obvious rock potential for a stoned monster-mash shuffle (if that heavily-reverbed cough in the beginning doesn't get the point across, changing the words to ""we'll be burning roaches you'll be kissing my ass"" quashes that last bit of subtlety). Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" is the last song I expected the band to cover, and while the drums gallop a little harder, they stay reasonably close to the source material. Elsewhere, Hawkwind's ""Urban Guerilla"" gets the Motown treatment, and the Fall's ""Dice Man"" becomes the soundtrack to a chase sequence from ""Hee Haw."" The later songs on Copycat Killers are less thrilling: The experimentation they bring to the pop tracks they cover is absent from songs closer to their style by the Troggs, Mott the Hoople, or, er, Leonard Cohen. Kicking some dust onto classics like ""Teenage Kicks"" would be preferable to the anemic by-the-numbers delivery here. Whether it's conscious or not, Cobra Verde send the message that the established rockers that influenced them directly are untouchable grails and pop/dance material is open to manipulation, and less worthy of reverence. Their take on ""Temptation"", which reduces New Order's electronic waves of bliss to a few acapella ""doot doo's"", proves otherwise (Is anyone in a band reading? Please, please, please, for the love of all that is holy, stop covering ""Temptation."" The original is note-perfect, and any attempts to diverge or get cute are just going to fall flat. Just ask Moby). But give Cobra Verde credit where it's due for pushing their boundaries on what easily could have been a tossed-off filler record-- and for having big record collections.","Covers album features interpretations of Donna Summer, Mott the Hoople, the Rolling Stones, and Pink, among others.

Kuutarha,Lau Nau,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde4ea9e61561daa77d6/1:1/w_160/9a950aeb.gif,2005-05-02 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4984-kuutarha/,Locust,"Ambitious crews like Gang Gang Dance, Animal Collective, Jane, Iran, and Excepter have recently transformed NYC's premature No New York Jr. hype machine into something genuinely exciting. But, turned-off by blindsided Big Apple-centrism, I could just as easily tag Vienna, Oslo, or the San Francisco Bay area as the key musical centers in my own personal cosmology. Right now, perhaps even more than those locations, I'd consider Tampere, Helsinki, and Turku, Finland the most fertile breeding ground for today's refreshing noises. Lucky for stateside consumers, Finnish hype means once impossible-to-locate releases are trickling-down to North American labels. I've listened to dozens of eccentric, beautiful Finnish albums and one of the best is Lau Nau's debut, Kuutarha, the work of 20-something Laura Naukkarinen. She's also a member and/or participant of Finnish ensembles Avarus, the Anaksimandros, Kiila, Kemialliset Ystävät, and Päivänsäde and most recently one-third of Hertta Lussuässä with Merja Kokkonen (aka Islaja) and Jonna Karanka (aka Kuupuu). Unlike these communal projects, she mostly goes it alone here, joined on a few tracks by Pekko Käppi on jouhikko (a fiddle played on the knee), Tomas Regan on acoustic bass and banjo, and Antti Tolvi on flutes, kantele, chimes, and mandolin. Fittingly, Kuutarha was originally a small edition, self-released and long out-of-print CD-R with handmade packaging that included painted sleeves, twigs/branches. Playing it regularly for months, it's become familiar enough that I find it difficult to explain, like if someone asked me to state in clear, declarative prose my smallest, subconscious habits. Focus could be placed on her astute experimentation but just as important is Naukkarinen as a scruffily polished singer/songwriter, one unafraid to trip between airy lullabies, eerie rambles, and Angus Maclise fireside jams. She digs deep into the musical toolbox, using (and I quote), acoustic bass, bass recorder, five-stringed kantele, acoustic guitar, tenor recorder, violin, bamboo flute, colorful juice glasses, mortar, mandolin, witch laugh megaphone, baby's rattle, bike bells, banjo, cowbells, electric guitar, organ, willow whistle, tablas, percussion, cymbals, comb, and beer cans to add to her blooming abstract folk milieu. Whether ""Johdattaja-Joleen""'s Avarus-style Django Reinhardt gypsy swing or the Henry Flynt embossed ""Kivi murenee jolla kävelee"", Naukkarinen manages to take a million-and-one risks while keeping things subtle, understated, aesthetically intriguing, and emotionally resonant. Naukkarinen sings in Finnish, so for non-speakers, lyrics will likely remain another hard-to-pin-down element. She provided me with English translations, though, and it turns out her use of language is just as nimble as her instrumentation. Opener "" Jos minulla olisi"" (""If I had""), nails silvan spiritualism: ""If I had a religion/ It would be a living creature/ One couldn't raise/ With any force or labour."" ""Pläkkikanteletar"" echos Wallace Stevens' ""Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird"" (""Five crows/ On a rainy asphalt/ Fly on great wings/ Through our window"") and ""Tulkaa!""'s insect bells, background swells, plucking, and singing saw contribute to a Leaves of Grass vocal invocation: ""Come kites!/ Come mosques!/ Come chaffinchs!/ Wise fellows of the forest!"" Kuutarha isn't perfect, but it gels and works perfectly in its own ineffable way-- its spare, haunted, almost silent acoustic ambiance comes off like a Vashti Bunyan madrigal broken into tiny parts then rewoven with grass to create a new, wraithlike mosaic openly defying the original time-based narrative, and replacing it with an experimental drift just as cohesive as its original, pristine format.","Eccentric, beautiful Finnish psych-folk from Hertta Lussuässä and Avarus member Laura Naukkarinen.

Worn Copy,Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a183ea9e61561daa4809/1:1/w_160/935a41ed.jpg,2005-05-02 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6554-worn-copy/,Paw Tracks,"Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti's official debut, The Doldrums, won praise for having the Animal Collective's graces and for being an uncanny perversion of the Me Decade pop-radio that worshipped the golden calves of Dylan, McCartney, Carpenter, and Orlando. Pink's second album, Worn Copy, furthers his cult-baiting mystique as a bedroom hermit from suburban L.A. who conjures up ghosts by burning a roll of avocado-green shag carpet un-vacuumed for 30 years. To his credit, Pink has sharpened his songwriting and studio touches-- he has several 1970s AOR-pop Muzak formulas nailed, making his freakitude compelling and digestible. That's a quality Ween and Redd Kross sometimes failed to capture-- quotation marks were clearly and fashionably marked on their odes to that decade's trash culture. But the problem remains that if the fashionably shoddy production values are removed from the sound, Pink's music would melt into the air. Still, Worn Copy's first half is a gas. Opener ""Trepanated Earth"" begins with a hazy, synth and flanged guitar. Pink then mumbles something romantic before one of his split personalities interrupts, ""The human race is a pile of dogshit!"" and ""Mankind is a Nazi!"" After a few false starts and jumbled rickets, he then becomes a charming easy-listening opening act for the Wings 75 tour. ""Immune to Emotion"" is nasally congested ""I'm OK, You're OK"" pop that could serve as country club luncheon entertainment. ""Jules Lost His Jewels"" is a 33rpm power-pop raveup cranked or ""Alvin-ized"" (as composer John Oswald might put it) to 45 with bloodlines that can be traced to the Mothers of Invention's ""Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance"". Pink's most poignant moments come when his low-fi smoke screen dissipates. ""Credit"" is a clever, disco-spiced lament that smokes its second pack of cigarettes over credit card policies and bills-- the mundane subject matter made so bizarre yet sensible for the inflation-addled 70s. ""Life in L.A."" is a fine downer-rock number with a languid mood that mimics the exhaustion of watching the sunset over a beach while you're trapped in a traffic jam on a freeway bridge. The rest of Worn Copy indulges in too many half-realized noise experiments and ideas. ""Bloody! (Bagonia's)"" is Pink amusing himself with Tourette's syndrome, while the quasi-rap number ""Cable Access Follies"" earns a silver star for imitating Beck at his most confusing. By the way, did you know that this year marks the 10th anniversary of Mike Watt's sleeper-hit ""Against the 70s""? It's the tune where the legendary postpunk bassist has Eddie ""Crazy Horse disciple"" Vedder sing, ""The kids of today must defend themselves against the 70's!"" The key lyric goes: ""It's not reality/ It's someone else's sentimentality.""","Pink's second album furthers his cult-baiting mystique.

Basement Anthology 1976-84,The Penetrators,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1925e6ef959693201f8/1:1/w_160/015b7fe7.jpg,2005-04-28 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6568-basement-anthology-1976-84/,Swami,"Many albums are reissued for ""reasons""-- Band X was ahead of its time, criminally underappreciated, it's influential yet out of print, whatevs. So there's something really refreshing about Swami reissuing the Penetrators' oeuvre just for the hell of it. Who needs reasons when you've got a reissue label and a bunch of tatty vinyl and live tapes sitting around? The Penetrators didn't make much noise outside of Syracuse, but for once, it's not because national heads weren't ready for their prophecies-- there's little to recommend them for anything beyond the local bar and basement circuit. Centered around Eliot (""Spike"") Kagan and Jack Lipton, the Penetrators released a few singles on their own Fred Records, shot a video for ""Shopping Bag"" that was summarily rejected by MTV (but got much love on Syracuse's public access cable), and petered out. They were a bunch of hammy dudes with bushy hair and smarmy mustaches, DIY as fuck (this may have been pragmatic-- it's difficult to imagine anyone doing it for them). Otherwise, they were a typical garage band, rocking hard and slightly sucking in the best way imaginable. Basement Anthology doesn't so much redress an injustice as it laughs in the face of common sense. But a neat thing happens-- instead of sitting down with a punk reissue touted as important and trying to hear its salience through a bunch of tinny crashing and banging, you can enjoy the Penetrators' life's work for what it is: A bunch of dudes having fun, banging out garage anthems that hit the usual marks-- boredom and apathy on the wailing ""Teenage Lifestyle""; complacent consumption on the skronking stomper ""Shopping Bag""; the redemptive power of rock on ""Rock-N-Roll Face"" (""But you can't get on my case/ When I wear my rock-n-roll face!""). But most indicative of the Penetrators' spirit is ""#1 Band in Town"", which might as well have been called ""Penetrators' Theme"". Over a righteously swaggering riff, the band proclaims their dominance in a big sing-along: ""We're the Penetrators, we don't fuck around/ 'Cause we're the number one band in this town!"" While this record is thrillingly inessential, it's a time capsule for a simpler musical era, before the Internet and the indie infrastructure existed, when the being the best band in town was really something to be proud of.","Swami reissues the best from this late 70s/early 80s Syracuse punk act.

Laughter's Fifth,Love as Laughter,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd73c0084474cd0c2cde/1:1/w_160/39a088de.gif,2005-04-28 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4881-laughters-fifth/,Sub Pop,"For their first album since 2001's drastically underrated Sea to Shining Sea, Sam Jayne and his Love as Laughter mates have ratcheted down their expansive guitar onslaught several degrees, closing the roof and fastening all the bolts as they cruise their sound brazenly towards classic rock orthodoxy. It's an approach obviously not without risks, as the virtually quirk-free Laughter's Fifth settles nearly its entire weight onto Jayne's songwriting shoulders. Fortunately, however, it's a load Jayne sounds as if he was born to tote, and here he delivers what is undoubtedly his tightest, most satisfying batch of songs to date. It's certainly a far cry from the disjointed, garagey fray of such early albums as The Greks Bring Gifts or #1 U.S.A., although even back when L\A\L was essentially Jayne's lo-fi solo project his fondness for foursquare Keith Richards chords and distorted Crazy Horse jamming crept itself in like jimson weed. Now, with the able-bodied assistance of bassist Brandon Angle and drummer Zeke Howard, Jayne truly has a band with no interest in doing things by half-measures, and Laughter's Fifth veritably rings with barstool drawls, mutton-chop riffs, and burly Creedence choruses. Though raucous tracks such as ""Every Midnight Song"" and ""Idol Worship!, Idol Worship!"" contain glimmers of L\A\L's grungier past, gone are the noisy Sonic Youth-inspired deformations that peppered albums like Destination 2000. Here Jayne's songs build their muscles through old-fashioned sweat and craftsmanship rather than feedback and distortion, with an unerring sense for when to pull back and when to pile on. On ""Dirty Lives"" the group marries its agreeably crunchy guitars to handclaps and a bouncy, almost new-wavish bassline to create album's most immediately addictive song, while the meditative ""Pulsar Radio"" constructs its passionate melodicism atop rich organ swells and chintzy low-tech bossanova beats. For the most part, though, Love as Laughter simply settle into the loose, rib-joint grooves of tracks like the opening ""In Amber"" or the wry ""I'm a Ghost"" (""I float throughout your house at parties/ Flirting with your guests sometimes...I'm a real nice guy for a ghost"") with such an infectious sense of rumpled delight that one is generally able to overlook the music's many ancestral debts. Though certainly not a head-turner as a vocalist, Jayne commits to these tracks with an amiable enthusiasm, and his guitar playing is deceptively stellar. The floorboards do sag a bit beneath the generic ""Survivors"" or the oddly anti-climactic closer ""Makeshift Heart""-- middling cuts which slow the album's overall momentum-- but these rare missteps are not enough to dim Laughter's Fifth understated, majestic glow.","Sam Jayne's group ratchets down its expansive guitar onslaught and cruises toward classic rock orthodoxy.

OK Cowboy,Vitalic,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9a29d034d5c69bf3cb3/1:1/w_160/e4dec5c1.jpg,2005-04-28 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8538-ok-cowboy/,PIAS,"With the possible exception of a certain French house duo whose name we won't bring up quite just yet, it's difficult to think of another dance act whose career ascent has been as storybook as Pascal Arbez's. After toiling for years in relative obscurity under the aliases Dima (as good as the name suggests) and Hustler Pornstar (uh, ditto), the Frenchman didn't just draw blood with Vitalic's 2001 Poney EP, he lopped a few arteries. Seriously, it's hard to overstate the response to Poney; of its four tracks, three became high-tide dancefloor staples. Along with the dark, yawning electro of ""Poney Part 1"" and ""Poney Part 2"", there was the centerpiece ""La Rock 01"", still the reigning champion of songs that sound like paper shredders orgying in a wind tunnel. While everyone from 2 Many DJs to Aphex Twin to Sven Väth was busy corking their sets with one (or two, or three...) tracks from Poney, Arbez was studiously lifting a few PR moves from his contemporaries, first by playing up his anonymity and later by concocting an elaborate backstory that involved a Ukrainian upbringing, animal fur trading, male prostitution, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Despite being offered enough shows to keep him busy until the fall of the Wailing Wall, Arbez chose his live engagements carefully. He applied a similar selectivity to his output, issuing only a few 12""'s and a handful of choice remixes over the next few years. That lull didn't do much to temper the weighty expectations placed on his full-length debut-- Lord knows, the Human After All-shaped hole in a lot of people's springtime playlists probably didn't help either. Happily, I can't imagine anyone who cared for Vitalic's earlier material being disappointed with OK Cowboy. Part of that is because Poney is built into this record's DNA-- rather than feeling like cursory inclusions, the EP's big three tracks sit beautifully alongside Arbez's less dancefloor-friendly, album-oriented material. The result is a much more complete and crafted record than you'd expect from an artist renowned for his killer singles. Not unlike LCD Soundsystem's best maximalist moments, the bulk of OK Cowboy's action happens in the mid and high registers. In the same way that most indie bands look to guitars to do the bulk of their storytelling, Arbez leans pretty compulsively on his synths-- that probably explains why so many have glommed onto words like ""metallic"" and ""rock"" to describe Vitalic's sound. The big new single here is ""My Friend Dario"", a jackhammering quiet-loud-quiet-loud guitar workout thing whose biggest fault is that it doesn't sound all that unlike Primal Scream's turn of the decade guitar techno coke freakout schtick. While it's a worthy enough addition as Vitalic burnburners go, it's hardly a patch on ""No Fun"" and ""Newman"", both of which boast synth lines that start out as pneumatic wheezes and turn into floor-swallowing squelches. But we already knew Arbez could do acid for the end of the world. What's more surprising are his slower songs, the plaintive bits and bobs that comprise the album's glue. Equal parts jerky organ workouts (""Wooo""), spacey Baroquisms (""The Past""), and funhouse melodies (""Polkamatic""), these tracks sketch out the other side of a polarity (sweet, charming Gallicisms on one side, four-alarm fires on the other) that, when its all said and done, has us thinking about that one French duo again. Not because Vitalic is a second generation imitation (Daft Punk has always had more grease in their wheels), but because he's made a record that's in the same league as Homework or Discovery. ","The long-awaited debut LP from Frenchman Pascal Arbez includes three-fourths of the seismic electro/techno Poney EP, which sits beautifully alongside his less dancefloor-friendly, album-oriented material.

Oscillons From the Anti-Sun,Stereolab,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5695e6ef95969320ac4/1:1/w_160/18ac18e2.jpg,2005-04-28 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7503-oscillons-from-the-anti-sun/,Too Pure,"Years ago, before all this file-sharing business, music fans were forced to spend hours standing around record stores, staring at overpriced import EPs and wondering whether they were really the sort of people who'd spend $12 bucks to hear four songs. Not only did all the pacing make you look like a moron, but the whole process had a way of making you really, really need the bathroom, leading to bad decisions you'd regret just as soon as you'd relieved yourself. This was the kind of thing that passed for bleak in the 1990s. And Stereolab, at least, made things easier on you, periodically collecting all the rarities you couldn't afford into their series of Switched On compilations. All you had to do to hear, say, Music for the Amorphous Body Center was wait patiently for a couple years-- pretty much like file-sharing on a dial-up connection. The thing that made the waiting difficult-- and the compilations useful-- was that Stereolab's sidelines tended to be better than a lot of groups' careers. This was, after all, the era's top record-collector band, and half of the appeal was their ability to tinker with genre in exactly the way EPs are built for. At their best, what you got out of a new Stereolab track wasn't just a new ""song,"" but a new sound-- some way of stylizing their scattered interests (krautrock? French pop? bossa nova? Moog records? exotica? the Jetsons?) into something unexpected. As a result, the tracks that weaved around their full-lengths felt less like cast-offs and more like peeks into an alternate history, a space that could include whatever tried-on styles didn't quite fit with a given album. By the tail end of the decade, the music on their EPs was beginning to feel even more accessible than the LPs they accompanied-- thanks to a streak of simple, swinging pop songs that didn't yet fit with the Groop's forward-thinking image. Those EPs, though, never qualified for the Switched On treatment. So now it's time to thank Stereolab for releasing this comprehensive box set-- a total beast of a package, spanning three full discs of EP material, over a time period stretching from 1993's Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements to 2001's Sound-Dust. Plus there's a bonus DVD of videos and television performances. Plus it's totally pop. Plus it costs less than $25. Less than $25! Artless as it might seem for critics to talk money, it's that low price point that makes me forgive the bizarre form these songs have been squeezed into. Before I caught that dollar sign, I was ready to spend several paragraphs bitching: If the idea was to compile a complete package, wouldn't you think they'd have lined up the EPs chronologically, each in its original sequence? And if the idea was just to let casual fans catch up, wouldn't you think they'd have cut out the album tracks that anchored most EPs, saving us the trouble of a third disc? Why go for a jumble like this one, where strings of terrific songs leave you feeling like you've got your hands on the ultimate Switched On, strings of album tracks leave you feeling like you've bought a weirdly-selected hits compilation, and odd juxtapositions seem to be trying to make the band's drony-motorik phases interchangeable with the fluffy pop of later records? Despite the complaints, anyone who enjoys Stereolab's late-90s albums will find more than enough here to satisfy, particularly where those pop impulses are concerned. Most thrilling of all are the releases that accompanied Emperor Tomato Ketchup and Dots and Loops, a period when the band tackled the EP as a way to try its hand at traditional pop forms; ""Brigitte"" is all slow, wet melody, and songs like ""Allures"" have a rainy-day pop swing that winds up feeling more Scandinavian than it does French. Those who've been waiting for this set will be even happier with the songs from the terrific Flourescences EP, which is as neat a pop package as you could ask for-- running from the flute-punctuated sway on the title track to the super-sunny bounce of ""Pinball"", the only song I know of whose creators can reasonably claim it was inspired by both Heavenly and Van Halen. By the time you get back around to the horn-swept lullabies on ""You Used to Call Me Sadness"" (already on one Switched On comp), it becomes clearer than ever why this band used to share fans with the early Cardigans; nothing says ""retro-futurism"" quite like stylizing old-fashioned pop into such clean, bubbly forms. Fans of the band's earlier, fiercer days will find slightly less to work with. Most of the drone here comes from Mars Audiac Quintet, the turning point between the buzzy charge they started off with and the well-groomed pop styles that eventually won them over. Tracks from the Wow and Flutter EP have plenty of bite, and part four of ""Nihilist Assault Group"" may be as hard as they've ever rocked, but inclusions from the Ping Pong singles hew closer to the album's moony, melodic pulse. (The two-chord organ line on ""Pain et Spectacles"" should top charts on its own.) More space winds up occupied by newer material, much of it from after the point where some fans (this reviewer included) fret that Stereolab's output began to feel vaguely academic; something always seems to have gone amiss when a band that could float gorgeously on two chords starts throwing in pedal-steel interludes just to keep you interested. Mixed in like this, though, you can start to appreciate them without your disappointment hackles raised. While some tracks from The Free Design and Captain Easychord (which prefaced Cobra... and Sound-Dust, respectively) seem to be trying and failing to find the vigor and ease of earlier work, they're still a pretty admirable extension of those earlier pop-experiment sidelines. And the tracks here seem to unfold into shinier gems the more you listen: ""Soop Groove #1"" like a tweaked-out cousin to ""Metronomic Underground"", ""Spinal Column"" twisting melodic intervals like never before, ""Les Aimes"" doing spooky Brazilian, and ""Long Life Love"" letting the late Mary Hansen chirp her way from the moon-lounge to the earth-bound swing and back. In summary: Not even $25! This may not be the band-history primer some people would like to say it is; give it to your favorite teenage rockers and they'll probably just wonder if people spent the whole of the late 1990s being quite so sweet and dreamy. And packing up like this certainly won't stop Stereolab from becoming the kind of group whose new albums people buy because they've ""heard so much about the band"" and then never really listen to. But for anyone who's already tapped in to the peaks of this band's career, the bulk of this stuff will prove exactly what you want out of EP material: Just as good as the albums, only different.","This three-disc, single-DVD package collects all of ver 'Lab's EP material released from the time of 1993's Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements through 2001's Sound-Dust.

Pretty in Black,The Raveonettes,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21b5e6ef9596932033d/1:1/w_160/0d19893b.jpg,2005-04-28 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6699-pretty-in-black/,Columbia,"Like sex, music can often be made even better with constraints. For instance, the Raveonettes produce their best material when Sune Rose Wagner makes himself work resourcefully within specifically defined boundaries. The band's first album, Whip It On, was written entirely in B-flat minor using only three chords, and Wagner and Sharin Foo banned hi-hats and cymbals and capped every song before the three-minute mark, resulting in a consistent gloom that, truth be told, didn't make it any less gimmicky or any more listenable. They fared much better on their major-label debut, Chain Gang of Love, its songs likewise limited to three minutes per song, three chords, and, most critically, B-flat major. These self-imposed constraints, along with liberal doses of distortion, created an intriguing duality: They put the band closer to their 1950s rock influences and made them sound much more primitive than they actually were, but the scuzziness of their sound also put a modern stance on their backwards glance, making their nostalgia for 50s delinquent cool much more useful than the rampant 60s garage rock retro. For all their reverence for Gene Vincent and namesake Buddy Holly, the Raveonettes weren't revivalists so much as revisionists, retrofitting their rock with all the explicit sexuality and dark violence that 50 years ago could only be conveyed implicitly. If the Raveonettes adopted any specific musical constraints on Pretty in Black, they're not very evident. Keys vary over the course of the album, and all but three tracks defiantly bound past the three-minute mark. The band has more than doubled in size, growing from a duo into a quintet and allowing Foo to set aside her bass and concentrate on singing. She and Wagner pick up around the same place they left off, with two sex-driven songs that would fit well onto Chain Gang of Love (""Seductress of Bums"" and ""Love in a Trashcan""), but then, over the course of the album, they gradually widen their scope as they road-test a variety of styles-- SoCal folk rock, fuzzed-out disco, New Wave, Wall of Sound-- and collaborate with some of their forebears, including Suicide's Martin Rev, Velvet Underground drummer Moe Tucker, and Ronnie Spector. With guests coming over, the Raveonettes have tided up their sound and made it presentable, removing all that screeching feedback in favor of a spic-and-span aesthetic. While such a move seems, in retrospect, inevitable, the spotless production undermines several songs, most notably ""Here Comes Mary"", highlighting the band's retro contrivances as they merely mimic rather than reimagine their influences. Wagner and Foo's ambitions, however, produce many inspired moments: ""Twilight"" pairs an inverted ""Twilight Zone"" guitar line with a fuzzed-out and sexed-up disco beat. Fortunately, ""Sleepwalking"" doesn't try to rewrite the Santo & Johnny hit (Modest Mouse beat them to it anyway), but generates a forward-leaning groove that, thanks to Foo's gauzy vocals, sounds almost like shoegazer. A lovely summer paean, ""Ode to L.A."" floats aloft on Spector's woah-oh-ohs, despite the fact that her voice has grown grainy with age and she can't hit the notes as confidently as she did with the Ronettes (or even with Eddie Money). Maybe it's that she's singing with a band half her age, but Spector sounds wistful for the past, and this tender nostalgia gives her vocals both a sadness and the authority of experience. Sensing their leading lady's vulnerability, Wagner and Foo wrap the music around her like a warm blanket. Moments like this instill the Raveonettes' music with something more than easy nostalgia for a sound they're too young to have experienced firsthand. But some constraints might have been useful: Pretty in Black sounds scattershot as Wagner and Foo chase after so many musical styles, some easily captured but others slippery and elusive. Such a pursuit may be admirable and even necessary, but here it creates a diverted and shapeless album that only hints at what they're capable of accomplishing.","On their third LP, the Raveonettes work in various keys, pen longer tracks, and employ additional players and guests, including Ronnie Spector, Martin Rev, and Moe Tucker.

The Needle Was Travelling,Tarwater,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7409d034d5c69bf374a/1:1/w_160/5122212e.jpg,2005-04-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7950-the-needle-was-travelling/,Morr,"Pop vocalists who are limited to three or four notes usually go one of two directions. They either drown their vocals in noise and render them ""just another instrument,"" saving their imagination for new daisy chains of effects pedals (see Labradford, Flying Saucer Attack) or they spend time on lyrics and make albums that may as well be filed under spoken word (latter-day Lou Reed and Leonard Cohen). If your voice is such that the mathematical possibilities of melodic variation are exhausted in four bars, the last thing you want to do is make music in a style where the tune is usually the focus. This ill-advised third path is where German duo Tarwater treads on their fifth album, *The Needle Was Travelling * . Eleven of the 14 tracks here are mid-tempo and musically reminiscent of 80s synthpop (updated with modern technology, of course), a genre with a rich history of hummable tunes. Unfortunately, vocalist Ronald Lippok (also of To Rococo Rot) is physically incapable of singing anything of the sort. The songs coming from his dour, uninflected voice-- which is constantly doubled to fill out the mix-- could be played on a keyboard by an armless dude with a pencil in his mouth. Even when Tarwater manage to get something cool going instrumentally (which happens occasionally), the vocals squash the life out of the track. Exception: ""Jackie"", a fine little tune carried by the lovely melodica that fills in the choruses, pushing the song in directions the singing alone could never take it. ""Jackie"" is catchy with an unusual arrangement and is worth tracking down. The other standout is the instrumental ""Stone"", a cheerful slice of technopop with a great squiggly synth hook and a disposition indebted to Kraftwerk's vision of technology's sunny future. After that, it gets pretty grim. The backing music on *The Needle Was Travelling * is a lush and generally appealing mix of guitars and synths, blended together in such a way that instrumental differentiation is difficult. As far as production goes, Tarwater remains proficient. But songs need to be judged as songs, and these aren't very good.","The Morr duo crafts midtempo, 80s-reminiscent electropop.

Blinking Lights and Other Revelations,Eels,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc09c0084474cd0c29ca/1:1/w_160/8fde09e7.jpg,2005-04-27 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2688-blinking-lights-and-other-revelations/,Vagrant,"Dear Editors: Since I was assigned to cover the Eels' new album, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, I have suffered a serious downturn in mental health. Repeatedly listening to the 90 minutes of music spread across two discs has sunk me into a deep clinical depression that has interfered with my job performance and home life. Therefore, I have no choice but to file a workman's compensation claim to cover the medical expense accrued in the course of this occupational injury. Please find enclosed receipts and insurance forms for therapy visits, prescriptions for Prozac and Wellbutrin, and experimental acupuncture treatments. Thank you. Mark Oliver Everett is what epidemiologists and Dustin Hoffman call a hotspot, a highly contagious carrier of an extremely virulent disease who infects anyone who crosses his path. With each album the self-abbreviated E releases upon the unsuspecting world, waves of melancholy diffuse outward like an oil slick, engulfing all who dare to listen. Six records into a career most thought would fizzle into little more than inclusion on The Buzz compilation, Everett has proved a persistent auteur obsessed with human emotion, following his mental health muse to increasingly elaborate sounds. Blinking Lights is a clear sign that Everett's fuel tank is not running dry; if anything, his momentum is only building. This time around, E has so many ways to describe his damaged psyche, it can't be contained by merely one disc, sprawling out to a runtime somewhere between Being There and Melon Collie. Within this extended framework, E finds the time to conduct thorough analyses of his sadness via a slew of genres and lyrical approaches, like he's trying to exorcise the ghost that haunts him by attacking from every possible angle. Right about now is where you start to think I'm beating this angle into the ground, that I'm making fun of Everett for his lack of subject matter diversity. Trust me I'm not, and I grant that E certainly has the biographical details to support any degree of sustained mood disorder. But neither do I exaggerate the single-mindedness of his approach; every time he finds solace in the arms of a girl (""Sweet L'il Thing"") or grows weary of the infinite sadness (""Suicide Life"") it's followed up by an immediate bat to the knee, chasing any good vibes back into the closet. Of course, you might not pick up on this stationary raincloud just with a surface listen, as E continues to prove himself a master of wrapping depressive material in deceptively soothing or poppy packages. Whether it's the That Thing You Do parody of ""Goin' Fetal"", or The Soft Bulletin sweep of ""Old Shit/New Shit"", or the early-period Tom Waits lounge-sleaze of ""Son of a Bitch"", Everett dips into 31 flavors of sound for the record's 33 tracks. Generally, the more elements Everett piles on, the more interesting things get, such as the ""Mr. Blue Sky"" orchestrics of ""Losing Streak"", or the surf drum/spaghetti western collision of ""Old Shit/New Shit"". Well, OK, maybe I'm overstating the variety for the sake of a bad ice-cream joke, as the majority of the tracks fall under the umbrella of slow guitar or piano dirges. Unfortunately, these are also the weakest of the bunch, the ones that find E veering most dangerously towards cliché and routine: peep the yikes-metaphor supporting the faux-collar folk of ""Railroad Man"". They also tend to be the ones where he can't help but sound like Beck, with his raspy drone and taste for vocal-filtering. Of course, pilfering the melody for ""Nobody's Fault But My Own"" (""In the Yard, Behind the Church"") doesn't help his cause. Here's the part where I fulfill my critic's duty by proclaiming that, as always, Blinking Lights would've been better as a single album, focusing less on the dull, Jon Brion clone theme song that recurs throughout, while also dropping a handful of the piano-and-groan duets. Ten years after ""Novocaine for the Soul"" was one of those weird, forgotten alt-rock hits, that same formula is still what works best for E: ethereal, odd, and catchy arrangements like album MVP ""Trouble with Dreams""; songs that file the sharp corners off the dispiriting thesis statement for his career. There's a good album underneath all the filler-- probably the Eels' best since Electro-Shock Blues-- but it'll take some editing to excavate it.","Latest from the pop depressive is a sprawling, ambitious, two-disc work.

The Art of Rolling,The Blue Van,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a485c0084474cd0c04e8/1:1/w_160/7caeaa60.jpg,2005-04-27 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1158-the-art-of-rolling/,TVT,"The Blue Van are more a controlled science experiment-- what happens when four zealous Danes are brought up smack dab in the middle of nowhere listening almost exclusively to Kinks, Animals, Who, and Doors records?-- than a fresh rock outfit. Their LP The Art of Rolling is an exhumed time capsule of 60s mod and psychedelica. Of course, considering how fellow Scandinavians the Hives, Raveonettes, and Soundtrack of Our Lives have all scored hit singles in the U.K and/or U.S. by channeling British invasion bands, the Blue Van's gritty, unaffected emulation of 60s blues-rock seems pretty logical, right down to the Andy Warhol-inspired album cover and mop-top hairdos. On The Art of Rolling, however, these guys don't simply pay homage to the Sixties, they seem to actually believe they're in the decade. A Hammond organ tinges every track, and singer/guitarist Steffen Westmark uses a tube amp to replicate the raw, crunchy guitar sound of early axe gods like Dave Davies. Drummer Per Jorgenson's hyperactive pounding recalls Keith Moon; crash symbols are used as hi-hats, the snare takes a serious flogging, and massive tom fills are thrown in at nearly every transition. For better or worse, the lyrics are equally dated, seldom addressing issues more dynamic than lovesickness, desperation, or down-on-your-luck blues. ""I Want You"" simultaneously steals the riff, hook, and lyric of the Kinks' ""I Need You"", and the same helpless romantic sentiment can be found in ""I Remember the Days"", ""Revelation of Love"", and ""Word From the Bird"". Word on the streets is that these guys are fun live, and they financed this album by playing about 50 electrifying, sold-out shows in Brooklyn. Maybe so, but on record I don't buy it. Sure, most tracks start with a funky drumbeat overdubbed with shouting and laughter, but that doesn't mean a party's going on. Too many progressions are pulled straight from blues guitar exercise books to conjure up much stimulation, and even at their most inventive, the Blue Van maybe sound worthy of an iPod commercial spot. To be fair, we were all totally stoked as kids when we stumbled across our parents' record collection and discovered there was music out there more intense and enthralling than The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The Blue Van don't mean to rip off classic rock, they've just been in arrested development since age 11. Still, even in a scene where every band's aping the retro sound, the Blue Van still come off hackneyed. The Hives at least fuse seering garage punk to their Rolling Stones pomp, while the Raveonettes sound increasingly more shoegazer than surf rock with every album. So what's the Blue Van's twist on classic rock? They use more organ? Better sound mixing? They're from Broenderslev?","Another LP of 60s-influenced garage rock from Scandinavia.

Name and game locked up in his harbor hometown's multiculturalism, Our Man From Odessa liked Kraftwerk and Giorgio as a cosmonaut-aspirant jugend (his name is ""German""). He did pirate radio (but not ""pirate radio"") via shortwave Western pap-loving Romanian broadcasts, and when stuff happened 89ish OMFO planned himself a trip around a Europe-- a Eurotrip-- during which he sampled the continent's musical flavors, collected its most bizarre instruments and synthesizers, and (I hear) played rhythm guitar for the Hungarian version of ""Scotty Doesn't Know"".

First, everything in the graf about sounds pretty awesome, doesn't it? The prospect of OMFO is flat-out exciting, really, just like what happened last year when this very same label put out Rio Baile Funk: Favela Booty Beats. Releases like this work well if only because they promise completely alien music-- some pocket of this earth that exists away from the panopticon of the internet and blogosphere and A&R; poaching. Lots fail me because, like TBE, they turn out to be boring Western pop with glass-bottom gimmicks. I'll take a Sonic Youth rip over that any day. Second, I'm afraid I've made OMFO out to be Osama, Manson, other Manson, Chevy Chase, and Lance Armstrong all in one-- like, the worst dude ever. I can't imagine OMFO's character being necessarily applicable either way, but for hermeneutics' sake he does seem genuinely proud of this stuff, and this particular bit-- ""Though it remains unclear whether the 'Trans Balkan Express' is a train or a space ship, these are territories that no human ear has ever dared to explore. Ladies and gentlemen: We are floating in Eastern European space""-- melts my decimal-point heart. And number three, how can I slag OMFO for playing dress-up but praise M.I.A. for rootless multiculturalism? Well guess what: you got me. I've been lying all along.

Warnings/Promises is a step in the same direction, the work of a polished radio-ready rock band, and if I had to sum it up in a word, it'd be ""comfortable"": Comfortable in writing calculated hits like ""Love Steals Us From Loneliness"" or ""I Understand It""; comfortable filling an arena with songs like ""I Want a Warning""; comfortable with the R.E.M comparisons that have followed them throughout their career-- on ""Not Just Sometimes But Always"" Roddy Woomble is a dead ringer for Michael Stipe. But ""comfortable"" is far from worthy. Warnings is Idlewild's first record without original bassist Bob Fairfoull, and their first written as a five-piece-- they now include a second guitarist and bassist culled from their touring band (Allan Stewart and Gavin Fox). It's neither a shock that they've defanged their sound nor that they followed The Remote Part with a record that's even more sedate. Fast tempos and distorted guitars don't always equate to passionate performances, but nothing on Warnings/Promises quite does. These songs chart easy territory: ""Love Steals Us From Loneliness"" has the tried-and-true quiet/soft dynamic and some background oohs and aahs, so there's your single. ""Welcome Home"" is the acoustic ballad that must follow, and ""I Want a Warning"" is the swaggering rocker that brings it up a notch after that (though it's one of Warning's better performances). ""As if I Hadn't Slept"" adds a dash of pedal steel to it's clean guitars to signify panoramic country-pop, and ""El Captain"" throws some misplaced disco rhythms as a coda to it's piano-driven radio baiting. To their credit, Woomble's melodies on ""As If I Hadn't Slept"" or ""I Understand It"" are exquisite, but they're dulled by ordinary arrangements, and he's leaning harder on Stipe here than ever with his delivery and harmonies. Songwriting chemistry is a tricky thing, and while having two or three competing voices can push writers to new heights, a group of five here leads to songs that are merely passable. Bottom line, if you've got five songwriters ready to take on the world and the best you can give us is ""Love Steals Us From Happiness"", this is an unfortunate let down.","Idlewild follow their European commercial breakthrough The Remote Part with this more defanged, sedate effort.

Over the course of his journeys-- in the past year alone he's lived in England, Prague, and New Mexico-- Barnes has accumulated fragments of ethnic folk dialects from seemingly every region on the atlas, and now as ringleader of A Hawk and a Hacksaw he ambitiously attempts to fuse these varied tongues into a unified, coherent vocabulary. Darkness at Noon, the second album from AHAAH, is a frenetic, dizzying pastiche of Eastern European folk, klezmer, mariachi, Appalachian fiddle music, and evocative jazz. And though Barnes and company fail to bring this bewildering array of streams into confluence, the album contains enough flashes of such melodic invention and daredevil instrumentation that armchair travelers can't help but be drawn to the group's exotic scrapbook. A Hawk and a Hacksaw's eponymous 2004 debut was essentially a Barnes solo act, but on Darkness at Noon he receives valuable assistance from such talented vets as trumpeter Dan Clucas and tuba player Mark Weaver, and the album even includes unspecified contributions from NMH's Jeff Mangum. This expanded group, and Clucas' work in particular, helps infuse tracks like the opening ""Laughter in the Dark"" and ""Europa"" with a languorous, Old World beauty that at times even bears reflections of Sketches of Spain. Generally speaking, the album tends to be most satisfying on its slower, more contemplative tracks, such as ""The Water Under the Moon"", a wistful, melodic ballad featuring violin, accordion and barroom tack piano, or ""Our Lady of the Vlatva"" which contains some lovely, Robert Wyatt-like vocalizing. Less beguiling are the handful of blustery up-tempo gypsy hybrids like ""The Moon Under Water"" or ""Wicky Pocky"", each of which are too frantically played and self-consciously eclectic to likely appeal to anyone who dances with less agility than Topol. Between these occasional lapses in subtlety, however, Darkness at Noon amply illustrates Barnes' keen ear for songcraft and talent for judicious cross-cultural pilfering, and offers enough evidence to generate the speculative hope that A Hawk and a Hacksaw might someday prove able to blend its multiplicity of influences into a more cohesive alloy stamped with its own distinctive, individualized imprint.","Latest from Jeremy Barnes is a frenetic, dizzying pastiche of Eastern European folk, klezmer, mariachi, Appalachian fiddle music, and evocative jazz.

Growing Green,Drowsy,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9ec0084474cd0c28cd/1:1/w_160/c5a5743c.gif,2005-04-26 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2592-growing-green/,Fat Cat,"Mauri Haikenen is a cheerful man in Finland's female-dominated, often desolate-sounding folk scene. A far cry from Keijo's spooky, noise-laden pastiches or Islaja's feral moan, Growing Green is subtly pastoral. Windblown acoustic guitars, flitting flutes, and melodic bass lines paint minimalist landscapes that tug at the imagination. Haikenen's debut, Growing Green-- which comes three years after his first single, ""Harmless""-- is uncharacteristically piecemeal, a premature compendium of a young singer/songwriter's scattershot yield. Haikenen is 22, but he doesn't sound it. Maybe it's the reverb talking, but his voice-- a weary warble-- is weathered beyond its years. Whereas ""Harmless"" drew Syd Barrett comparisons and even placed in Haikenen's hands, as IDJ so modestly put it, ""the future of electronic music,"" Growing Green is acoustic folk music, plain and simple. The album enters gingerly, as a lolling acoustic guitar works in the voids between distant bass rumblings. It sounds genteel, but Haikenen is feeling brassy: ""You are all whores, and I hate you all,"" he sings. Surprising words, perhaps, but this song's strength is atmosphere. Haikenen's guitar playing, heavy yet luminous, shows a Nick Drake-ian sensibility. Haikenen can be solitary or affable-- he undergoes abrupt mood shifts, vastly and somewhat whimsically altering the character of his voice. On the idyllic ""Yellow Leaves and White Trees"", he's gauzy and barely audible, following each few seconds of strumming with a wisp of vocal. ""Careless Me"", meanwhile, consolidates his variegated approach: as the volume builds (thanks mostly to accordion), Haikenen's voice gets lower and raspier. It's as if it has separate top and bottom compartments, to be favored and mixed as deemed fit. ""I Watch The Sky"" tries too hard to find Dylan, and ""5 Bright Dawn"" might as well be cutting'n'pasting passages from Chronicles before it gets all lo-fi scuzzy with some electric guitar and clangorous drumming. Next to the scruffier work of a more explorative folkie like Islaja, Growing Green could seem innocuous. But Haikenen is hardly conventional (see: the glacial sweep of ""Harmless"", the barren electronics on ""Cryosleep""). If anything, his relative straightforwardness stems partly from a diplomatic prowess that will only boost his export potential. At the album's dullest, remind yourself that the kid's just 22, and that if you sat with him round a bonfire listening to these songs, totally disarmed, you might soon be looking for a shoulder to weep on.","Finnish folkie Mauri Haikenen paints minimalist landscapes on his debut LP.

Songs for Silverman,Ben Folds Five,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdedeb335119a49ecfa6/1:1/w_160/12058449.gif,2005-04-26 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3139-songs-for-silverman/,Epic,"Back when he was Five, Ben Folds made punk rock for wussies. With a goofy drawl and sloppy piano-fisting (SFW, natch), Folds alternately threw stones and built glass houses. He'd mock a too-cool coterie of nose-ringed goths and closeted ex-Cure fans (ah, those innocent pre-Killers 1990s!), then let his guard down for ballads about heartbreak and, yes, the abortion that hurtled the Five through fame's window like a post-Final Four student rioter's ""Brick"". His hipster-baiting, sincerity and modest fame guaranteed a few nasty reviews, sure. Still, Folds challenged cred-consciousness before crying ""rockist!"" was OTM. Wussy, yes, but worthy. Folds may as well have dubbed his second ""TJ Hooker""-free solo album Wuss and Wussier. Songs for Silverman doesn't mean anything, anyway. Hey, just like the title of BFF swan song The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner! This time out, Folds tries to combo-meal his bratpop funnin' and balladic touchy-feely, but though a genial intelligence remains, the #2 is rarely funny or touching. Forget Rockin' the Suburbs; the new Folds can barely rock an infant to sleep, though at one point he tries. Wuss-out #1: Opener ""Bastard"" sneers at an old man. Hey, just like ""Uncle Walter""! Except in this case the old man is really a young man who's heard it at all, perhaps a cynical hipster. Hey, just like ""Underground"" or ""The Battle of Who Could Care Less"" or ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" or ""There's Always Someone Cooler Than You""! Except, as throughout Songs for Silverman, Folds' once-brutish ivory-stomping has softened to Nordstrom lobby levels (otherwise he's ditched Suburbs' MTV-striving sheen for faux-Five). Dude says this one's really about young conservatives, but the lyrics sure are careful not to crap on potential purchasers' fresh-pressed khakis. Wuss-out #2: ""Jesusland"" opens with a propulsive, swirling chord progression. Hey, just like ""Ascent of Stan""! In post-Schiavo, Tom DeLay-era, post-contraceptive (wait, that's next year) Amerika, entire box sets could be devoted to ruminations on the nation that neighbors the United States of Canada, from Toby Keith pro to Billy Joe anti, or even apolitically humanistic (hey, just like ""Brick""!). Except the best Folds can muster is stale McMansion jokes. Even Time covergirl Ann Coulter wouldn't call Folds a traitor for this bland waffle. Wuss-out #3: ""Late"" is about Elliott Smith. Hey, there's a classically unadorned yet vivid Folds lyric: ""Elliott, man, you played a fine guitar/ And some dirty basketball."" Except the chorus goes: ""It's too late/ It's too late/ Nah, don't you know/ It's been too late."" Not ""Candle in the Wind"", but hardly a fitting tribute. Hey, do those somber chords sound more like ""Evaporated"" or ""Eddie Walker""? Wuss-outs #4-#11: Hey, first single ""Landed"", a catchy sigh of post-breakup relief, takes off with a bitchin' piano riff that's just like ""Philosophy"" in a minor key! Folds followers will quibble over whether the Pure Prairie League pedal steel of ""Give Judy My Notice"" betters the ponderous run-through from 2003's Speed Graphic EP, except who cares, it's not even as good as ""Carrying Cathy""! Hey, ""Time"" is almost the first verse of ""Narcolepsy"" plus a weirdly straight Weird Al. ""You to Thank""? Not bad, and hey best piano breakdown since ""Song for the Dumped""! Fatherly endearment ""Gracie"" would be a charming pretension-clearer on a better album. I don't remember anything about ""Sentimental Guy"" or ""Prison Food"" except hey one of them starts like ""Emaline"".

Futurist,Alec Empire,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc69abf31b7dc7155cf6/1:1/w_160/5b2b67e5.jpg,2005-04-26 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2780-futurist/,Digital Hardcore,"As second-generation industrial egoist-martyrs go, German pitbull Alec Empire and Trent Reznor have a lot in common. Physically, their impossibly wan expressions work overtime to contrast their black-hole locks, suggesting brooding dichromatic cartoon characters. And their hammer-to-the-head blunt takes on Nietzsche and nihilism are equally cartoonish; such stunted ideas of death, destruction, and anarchy are as awe-inspiring to wayward teens as they are laughable to about everyone else. Both skinny puppies spent the 1990s pushing industrial music in new, sometimes striking directions only to run out of black nail polish near the turn of the century. Similarly, the duo released bloated double albums a few years ago only to come back in the last few months with stripped-down, self-consciously ""raw"" follow-ups. After taking industrial to its logical noise-soaked endpoint, Empire struggles on his misleadingly titled Futurist, which eschews his forward-thinking dancefloor-clearing breakbeats and Eno-style ambient ramblings for a more up-front punk approach. Though he's still scowling and screaming with verve, the traditional song structures and relatively mild rock production unfortunately puts more emphasis on his straight-faced, literal-as-fuck lyrics. ""Kiss of Death"" is the first and best track on the record, with the following 11 songs relegated to less inspired versions of the same Pistols-meets-KMFDM formula. The guitars dominate the mix throughout, their power chord fury nearly matching Empire's corrosive, distorted vocal. ""I'm Here to stay!!! You better watch out cuz I came to terminate!!!!"" he sings with genuine, if somewhat pathetic, passion (capitalization and punctuation based on his official site, natch). For any other artist, the track would be considered quite breakneck but compared to his own brand of television-static cocaine-jungle, ""Kiss of Death"" is almost midtempo. The three-chord simplicity is admirable and refreshing at first, though it quickly starts to wear thin in all respects. It's easy to poke fun at Alec's somewhat lost-in-translation goth-gangster pose, but for all his anti-establishment hollering, Empire's mantras often come off as a tad militaristic in their repetitive simplicity. On the monotonous ""Point of No Return"", it's not enough to repeat the title over and over (and over), he even goes on to explain it, in case you were confused: ""You can't go back even if you wanted to."" There's reinforcing the humorless German stereotype and then, it seems, there's Alec Empire. When wrapped in confrontational music that matches his unwavering hatred of ""the man,"" Empire can be enthralling but Futurist's sordid punk suggests our man may have cornered himself. Now in his 30s, this black-clad fist-pumper has always been at his best when taking into account all of his industrial influences, from Einstürzende Neubauten to Ministry, and spewing them out in brain-cell-crushing odes to nothingness. Futurist, with its muddy, one-note punk-thrash revivalism that belies his talents as a versatile studio auteur, is as frustratingly unremarkable and immobile as the governments he so blatantly rails against.","As second-generation industrial egoist-martyrs go, German pitbull Alec Empire and Trent Reznor have a lot in common.

The Best Party Ever,The Boy Least Likely To,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a484ea9e61561daa4f0e/1:1/w_160/56c8f44b.jpg,2005-04-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1157-the-best-party-ever/,Too Young to Die,"Children's innocence is magical not because of what they don't know-- sex, violence, mortality, Ashton Kutcher-- but how they perceive what they do know. In a child's mind, grown-ups are distinguished by their calves, raindrops on car windows can become aliens racing through space, and long backseat rides furnished with action figures set the stage for Lord of the Rings-scale epics. By now it's axiomatic that most popular entertainment misses childhood's true majesty, but every once in a while a Peanuts or Calvin & Hobbes hits upon just the right mixture of confusion and imagination. The Best Party Ever, which compiles the first three singles plus five new tracks from UK-based The Boy Least Likely To, shares that youthful, existential whimsy. This isn't children's music, but it takes a child-like eye to Postcard bedsit pop awash in 1960s California sunshine with hints of country and soul. Recorders, twinkling synths, handclaps, banjos, and glockenspiel accompany the requisitely shambling acoustic guitar on songs about tigers, monsters, growing up, and ""Warm Panda Cola."" The Best Party Ever is a thing of wonder, made out of rubber and springs-- heartache with a sense of humor. The band name (a regendered Morrissey song title) and the album moniker both cry ""twee,"" and there's no denying The Boy Least Likely To's recurring fuzzy wuzzyness. But solid songwriting sets the duo of Pete and singer/lyricist Jof apart from the anonymous Belle and Sebastian novitiates responsible for stigmatizing indie pop in some hipper-than-thou circles. Opener ""Be Gentle With Me"" could be about new love or a budding playground friendship, and it contains multitudes of appealing elements, from its opening starward gaze to a stomping country-disco beat to bizarre non sequiturs like ""I want to pick peaches off a cherry tree."" Winning melodies and the album's likable if neurotic raconteur-- ""Scared of spiders/ Scared of flying""-- give the quirky arrangements an emotional payoff. Besides, for all its playfulness The Best Party Ever isn't quite the doe-eyed ""Hakuna Matata"" some early reviews have suggested. Jof's narrator is child-like, but it's just a case of arrested development-- a young man confronting early adulthood in this chaotic century, not with the stoned quotidian of the Streets or the post-apocalyptic communalism of the Arcade Fire, but through a regression into childhood. Thus spooky-synth jam ""Monsters"" sees friends and loved ones terrifying the narrator by ""getting married, having babies""-- and suggesting he'd be happier if he did, too. The gleefully paranoid ""I See Spiders When I Close My Eyes"" briefly reveals the anxiety beneath its stiff-lipped cheer: ""How did I get to be a mess so soon in my life?"" Aching standout ""The Battle of the Boy Least Likely To"" features a prominent, ""Sloop John B""-like recorder with quavering vocals about letting go; the effect is akin to a child's first encounter with death. Yet above all, The Best Party Ever is as fun as pelting Susie Derkins with water balloons. ""I'm Glad I Hitched My Apple Wagon to Your Star"" lives up to its lengthy title with the best-ever musical mention of antihistamines and the tale of an ill-fated Nashville excursion over ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" oompahs. ""We never did get famous, but it made us kinda happy and it kept me off of drugs!"" Jof explains. ""My Tiger My Heart"" recalls a Psapp album title for a ballad that's a bit like ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" meets Calvin & Hobbes or Winnie the Pooh, as Jof relates the difficulty of being ""friends with something that eats butterflies and pencil sharpenings."" The album's best song, the dreamy ""Paper Cuts"", channels Brian Wilson via Summerteeth-era Wilco through the lens of Aztec Camera. It's a broken-hearted ballad about helplessness against an ever-changing world, but it also points to the essential precariousness of what makes The Boy Least Likely To so appealing. ""If you throw a light on something magical it disappears,"" sings Jof. Let's hope not. ","Behind the cartoon-twee cover and Morrissey-referencing bandname is, you guessed it, an indie pop band-- one that combines a child-like eye, a sense of humor, heartache, and Postcard bedsit pop awash in 1960s California sunshine with hints of country and soul.

Nothing's Lost,Styrofoam,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5945e6ef95969320b2e/1:1/w_160/0643bb68.jpg,2005-04-25 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7546-nothings-lost/,Morr,"First off, Nothing's Lost is a winter record, so unless you're stuck in perpetual December, it won't do you much good now. Go outside. Secondly, the only reason I say it's a winter record is because I can't think of any other time when anyone would tolerate its relentless grousing. Styrofoam have always put forth a sort of wistful glitch-hop, but Nothing's Lost elevates the mope to an art form. They implement a policy of Leave No Platitude Behind with enough conviction to sustain the record for about four bars; then you realize the striking similarities between this LP 's over-dodged Notwist-style lap pop and, um, Linkin Park. We don't even need an audibly breath-controlled verse from guest emcee Alias to tell us that. The list of other guest appearances here reads like a who's-who of post-glitch lap-pop: Postal Service and Death Cab star Ben Gibbard not only provides vocals but contributes music to several tracks as well. Andrew Kenny of American Analog Set and Valerie Trebeljahr of Lali Puna also take turns on the mic, and Notwist/Lali Puna leader Markus Acher pitches in on guitar. Opener ""Misguided"" is an inauspicious dud, leaving Styrofoam to scrape himself off the ground. He manages, just barely. The rest of Nothing's Lost nine tracks carom from fuzzy-wuzzy IDM to rain-soaked shoegazer and often dwell in the spacious grey area between half-digested genres. No other track is as vapid as ""Misguided"", but the opener puts Styrofoam at a deep disadvantage, from which he never quite recovers. ""Ticket Out of Town"" is one big long sloppy 80s college rock guitar solo swamped in white noise and an overbearingly busy beat. It's an interesting concept, but Styrofoam has trouble deciding which elements to give preference and it never coagulates. Ben Gibbard guests on ""Couches in Alleys"", a song which miraculously finds a way to make the Postal Service frontman sound even more precious than his own band's protocol. ""Front to Back"" takes a slithery, Moby-style beat and wrings all the bathetic juices out of it, finding peace by propulsion. Incidentally, the record's most upbeat track is also its strongest. Sporting a beeline dance beat and an anthemic chorus, ""Anything"" explores the flipside of Styrofoam's typically frowning approach. Maybe it's unfair that we excuse cornstarch more readily when it's bright and beaming than when it's downtrodden, but Styrofoam should keep the prejudice in mind. Whereas five years ago it might have seemed novel, hacking conventional songwriting with CPU's and lacing it with twitchy synthetic beats is old hat. But Styrofoam isn't at fault for trying to do something new and failing--he's guilty of a shoddy translation job. Nothing's Lost attempts to superimpose traditional pop formats onto a digitally-enhanced and -metamorphosed aesthetic. Postal Service succeed by paring down-- they're lo-fi for the G5 era. L'Altra and Notwist are pop wizards masquerading as techies. Not even Pope Benedict XVI, meanwhile, knows what's happening beneath Dntel's beautiful textures, but who cares? Styrofoam, by comparison, has no singular strength. Nothing's Lost is a well-meaning record that just got its priorities mixed up. These tech'd-up tearjerkers can out bench press anyone in terms of sonic fodder, but the album is whiny, transparent, and a colossal hodgepodge.","Morr electro-poppers' latest collection of tech'd-up tearjerkers features contributions from Ben Gibbard and Markus Acher.

Ragga Ragga Ragga 2005,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a844c0084474cd0c0db8/1:1/w_160/1ab1ddb4.jpg,2005-04-25 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2082-ragga-ragga-ragga-2005/,Greensleeves,"For most Americans, dancehall's relative health is down to two things. One is radio exposure. There've been major and minor U.S. dancehall hits since forever, from Shabba to Shaggy to Beanie. But the last few years have been a golden age for dancehall on the radio, as both ""Diwali"" and ""Coolie Dance"" ignited riddim mania for the first time in the U.S. The other is CD compilations, especially Greensleeves' Biggest Dancehall Anthems and Ragga Ragga Ragga series. The 2003 editions of both are among the best records released in the new millennium, accurately reflecting what a great year it was for dancehall. But, for me, 2004's editions failed to catch fire. Was something rotten in the state of dancehall? Well, yes and no. Both CDs lacked the same number of exciting riddims as their 2003 counterparts. But, if you managed to dig through even a bit of the yearly mudslide of JA-only singles and one-riddim albums, you'd find beats (""Bubble Up"", ""Dancehall Rock"") that slew the immediately canonized ones. So, yes, it's foolish to attribute a creative slump to the licensing capabilities of a single label. But since most of you are A) American, B) not hardcore dancehall fans, and C) employed at least part-time, compilations it is. And to judge by 2005's RX3, the dilettantes are facing an even sketchier crop. Most of my annoyance with current dancehall stems from the continued influence of soca. Soca, for those who don't know, is the preferred Carnival soundtrack for many Caribbean nations. To the naked, untrained ear, soca seems close to dancehall, the way your grandma would hear no difference between Aesop Rock and Paul Wall. But soca is, if nothing else, faster than dancehall. Fast enough to make the LCD examples of it sound like cranked-up cruise ship commercials. Soca does have its more ""innovative"" aspects like a submerged bhangra influence that's surely had a little to do with dancehall's own far east fetishism. But, as artists like TOK began to mix up soca with their hardcore boy band ragga, they set in motion dancehall's current fascination with hypa-hypa 120bpm dance craze tunes. Call me a fun-hating old crank, but a lot of this stuff is really goddamn annoying. Worst offender here is Macka Diamond's ""Lexus & Benz"". Not only does it feature the de rigeur spastic oompah oompah beat, but includes...wait for it...a banjo. Really fast ""Hee-Haw"" banjo. I'm sorry but this is whimsy gone too far. Other subpar tracks include Voicemail (wtf), Delly Ranks, and Bogle's ""Weh Di Time"", another ""do the yardie Mashed Potato"" tune. (I should take a second here to say RIP to Bogle, who was like Bez crossed with MJ in his prime and something like a national deity. His death is the only reason I feel iffy dissing all the dance craziness here.) Macka Diamond's ""Mr. Teki Back"" has an annoying brapp-brapp military beat. (As does Sizzla's ""I'm With the Girls"".) Then that fucking banjo shows up again on Beenie's ""Dance To the Chakka"". Could we have more Junior Byles and less Junior Samples, please? But, as per Jamaica's per annual output, there are gems here. Beenie's ""Ziggy Zung"" is a soca-styled track that works, mostly due to the inclusion of the line ""Peter Peter pum pum eater."" Vybz Kartel's ""Dutty Panty"" is a nicely clonking old school groove with a bizarre injunction against sheer undies. On the other side of sanity, Vybz's ""Spragga Connection"" is a virulent diss track originally titled, uh, ""Faggot Correction"". You can hear the knot of tension forming in his neck as he (literally) spits the foul line about Foxy Brown pissing in Spragga's face. Mad Cobra's ""Switch"" answers my thwarted request post-""Allo Allo"" for a dancehall track with an accordion, plus a clanging submarine alarm which I didn't ask for, but what they hey. Beenie Man's ""Three Laws"" is bleep and bass played at 140bpm, and with another argument against an oral sex contract in the mutual interest. (Really fellas, it ain't gonna bite you.) Vybz's ""School Bus"" has a vaguely eastern synth drone and avalanche drums with Vybz sagely advising the youth not to have sex on the bus but to instead study chemistry and ProTools. And who says ragga's all amoral gunplay and fassy bashing?","Annual, typically solid Greensleeves compilation rounds up recent dancehall tracks.

Low Road / High Road,Okay,by: Stephen M.

In the case of Okay, the pseudonym for one-man band Marty Anderson, once you've learned he suffers from a strain of Crohn's disease and is more or less house- and IV-bound, the urge arises to hear his twin debuts, Low Road and High Road, as expressions of his medical condition, perhaps even as meditations on encroaching mortality. Even the moniker Okay sounds like a playful comment on his condition, a response to so many inquiries about his health. Musically and lyrically, his eerie pop music provides more-than-ample support for such an interpretation, but Anderson's concerns are much broader than that, and his songs about friends and lovers, connection and betrayal, war, and music are specifically grounded in a world outside his body. Like Sparklehorse's Good Morning Spider and East River Pipe's The Gasoline Age, Low and High Road are defined by the eccentricities of their lone creator and inevitably by the circumstances of their recording. Yet, despite those worthwhile comparisons, Anderson has a very distinctive and resourceful pop aesthetic, developed during his years fronting Fremont, Calif.,'s Dilute and working with Thingy's Kenseth Thibideau in Howard Hello. He draws from disparate sources, structuring some songs as hymns (""Replace"" rewrites ""Amazing Grace"") and others as epics in miniature complete with chorales of kazoos (he plays what sounds like a blade of grass on ""Sing-along""). His vocals initially can be disorienting and potentially offputting: With its insectoid pitch, his voice sounds as if it's been digitally altered to protect his identity. But it's no affectation, and in fact, its strange, often strained intimacy makes it a perfect vehicle for his wary, weary lyrics. Anderson builds these 22 songs as carefully calibrated contraptions, fitting together guitar, keyboard, drums or drum machine, handclaps, and whatever other sound satisfies his whim until the sprockets all click into place. This approach gives ""Now"", ""Compass"", and ""We"" a toylike self-propulsion, as if Anderson has simply wound them up and set them to wander around his home studio. But just as he puts these songs together, he also takes them apart: On ""Roman"", ""Devil"", and the instrumental ""Up"" he sets the gears to grind against each other until the songs fall apart in a mechanical cacophony. It's tempting to read this disassembly as self-destructive (which makes the Sparklehorse comparison all the more meaningful) or simply as somatic-- the song as burdened body, the instruments as malfunctioning organs. Sonically, Low and High Road are more or less identical, but thematically, they are as different as their titles suggest. Low Road is the more pessimistic of the two, gloomily fatalistic and often darkly humorous, especially ""Hoot"", on which Anderson sings ""there's always going to be a war...each and every one of us is a whore."" High Road is slightly more hopeful, but guardedly so; On ""Good"" Anderson sings, ""Look for the good/And find the good"" over and over like a recovery mantra. High Road is perhaps just a little more streamlined and engaging than Low Road, its pop elements more focused toward a holistic effect. It's tempting to read these albums as evocations of the afterlife, Low Road leading to damnation and High Road to redemption with Anderson and all of us at the crossroads. And while these two sides of his Okay persona interact dynamically and complicate these albums' relationship to each other, reducing them to expressions of his medical condition ignores the complexities of his seemingly simple lyrics and constrains the music to merely one meaning. Perhaps even unintentionally, Anderson has created two complimentary works that sound so much larger than his predicament.","Pair of LPs from housebound one-man band Marty Anderson.

It's the only word you could apply to all of the Denver quintet's music, from their loudest, fastest moment to their iciest piano passage. They bring their stately approach to a sound that migrates freely through cabaret, prog, country, folk, jazz, chamber music, and arena rock, often with a subtle electronic edge. The crux of that sound is the voice of pianist John Grant, a powerful, rangy instrument he's not shy about wielding in all its booming glory. His piano playing is often just as weighty, and he opens Goodbye with a chilly impressionist meditation reminiscent of the dolorous mid-section of Procol Harum's ""In Held 'Twas I"" before the title track clicks in with a gliding modern r&b; groove. ""Goodbye"" is full of twists and turns, pulling its minor key melody through tempo changes and harmonized Radar Brothers slo-core detours in a sort of microcosmic sampler of the album in full. The album's most impressive song, the soaring, crystalline ballad ""Paint the Moon"", has an exhilarating, simple melody, dramatic chord progressions, and a sweeping arrangement. The guitars spread like the sun on the Eastern slope of the Rockies, fanning out in twanging, echoing eternity over Jeff Linsenmaier's militaristic drums. Grant croons with heart-stopping authority and the chorus lifts off like a child's lost, melancholy balloon. Nothing else on the album quite touches that tingling peak, but the record is full of ideas and unique arrangements, smothering the credible soft-rock of ""The Hymn"" with ghostly harmonies and spacey electronics and leaping into electro-prog territory on ""I Am the Man"", with Grant ceding his humanity to a vocoder over hammering drums and squealing synth. ""Trash"" bursts into a ridiculous bout of fretboard fireworks with guest guitarist Richard Odell spouting off ""Eruption"" style, while ""Pain"" rocks in more of a Euro-indie fuzz vein. And then there's the stunning ""Little Pink House"", a jazz burner stuffed with trumpet and fat piano chords, both guest Julie Monley and Grant singing straight from their guts. The Czars are, in short, an impressive band with a handle on how to properly synthesize a plethora of strong influences. Though it has its moments of excess (really, that ""Trash"" solo is a bit overboard), Goodbye is a luxurious album of subtle, exactingly crafted pop that's easy to come back to.","Elegant Denver quintet migrates freely through cabaret, prog, country, folk, jazz, chamber music, and arena rock, often with a subtle electronic edges.

1981,Markus Guentner,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfb8abf31b7dc7156358/1:1/w_160/e7f3f134.jpg,2005-04-24 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3586-1981/,Kompakt,"If Markus Guentner really titled this after his birth year, then where is my fucking AARP card? He's only three years younger than me, but that means that in 2001, when he made In Moll, his solo debut on Kompakt, he was only 20. Twenty! Sure, In Moll was rather shameless Gas worship. (Gas being the drowsy Arcadian ambient project of Kompakt founder Wolfgang Voigt.) It shared Voigt's love of soft-focus, gently chugging house beats (nicked from Chain Reaction and then dusted down with baby powder and packed in gauze) and synths with plenty of vaseline on the mix. What it lacked was Voigt's overall denseness of massed orchestral samples (his synth equivalent) that made GAS records like Pop such an overwhelming yet wombing experience. (Number one bedtime album, 2000 to present.) In Moll was sparser, cleaner, and more pulse-based. It was also fucking gorgeous. Well, I am pleased to report that four years on very little has changed. Guentner still sounds like he's happy exploring ever more subliminal notes in an unending wash of hyper-sustained synth chords. The beats again sound as if they're moving through a tarpit made of cotton candy. The only major deviation is ""Hi-Jacked"", a sludgly, mid-tempo shuffle that only stands out because it approaches actual music amidst its narcotized surroundings. The rest is a million shades of shimmer, crackle, and pulse. Wait, am I pleased? There's a fine line between exploring a set range of sounds or a delineated mood, and out-and-out self-parody. Guentner hasn't crossed it yet, but Kompakt and contemporaries have pretty steadily horsewhipped the idea of 21st century new age over successive Pop Ambient comps, full lengths, the wine bar at the back of Hard Wax (the password is ""strudel""), etc. Guentner is capable of more: check his breezy proto-Junior Boys remix of Coloma's ""Summer Clothes"" for proof. In another four years, I hope he's raided some Germanic garage sales for leftover vocals (I hear Superpitcher's got yards of them), beats with treads on them, whatever. In the meantime, take the above numerical rating as a sleepytime guide to a soundtrack for a good rest. With stuff like this, it's not a diss.","Kompakt's ambient pop wunderkind follows the exquisite In Moll with more subliminal notes and hyper-sustained synth chords.

Always Never Again,Supersystem,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a813d1975652139226/1:1/w_160/5cdea64b.jpg,2005-04-24 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7810-always-never-again/,Touch and Go,"The men behind El Guapo are sneaky fellows. They may have a new band name (Supersystem) and a new record label (Touch & Go), but in spite of some personnel shuffling (mainly the addition of drummer Joshua Blair, making them a quartet), they still take the same approach: merging rousing D.C.-punk anthems and dance music, and yielding mixed results. Always Never Again makes me think the band has a convincing dance record in them somewhere. The elements are there, and this album seems more full and maximalist than Supersystem or Fake French. But on like those earlier records, Supersystem here manage to shoot themselves in the foot before the party ever gets going. El Guapo's round-style harmonies were a point of contention, and they're still here on Always Never Again. I don't consider clever lyrics a requirement in either dance or rock, but these are distractingly inane. After a Ratatattin' video-game music intro, second track ""Everybody Sings"" repeats the same trick as Fake French's ""Just Don't Know"", repeating one phrase ad infinitum, interspersing different nouns (""Do you feel the connection to people on the surface?/ Do you feel the connection between people in the office?""), hoping to find meaning by accident. And after listening to previous single ""Born Into the World"" (""I was born above a candy store/ Behind a great big marble door""), I'm pretty sure they're making the words up as they go along But more than that, Supersystem want you to get down to their punk-funk hybrid so badly, they use every trick they have, on every track, all at once. It's the execution that bogs the record down; it lacks subtlety, tension, or surprise. The sax on ""Click Click"" is a nice touch-- as are the chilly keyboards on ""Born Into the World"" or the violins and Cure-inspired phased guitar on ""Miracles"". But then the vocals come in, and manic layering of instruments and beats continues without any kind of melodic variation. As a result, tracks like ""Defcon"", with a decent beat and solid drive, are weighted down by clutter. There are Latin rhythms and tones popping up in tracks like ""Six Cities"" and ""The Love Story"", but that's really the only step Supersystem has made from their former namesake-- if you didn't like Fake French, nothing here will change your mind.","Touch & Go presents the latest from former members of El Guapo.

ASAP: The Afrobeat Sudan Aid Project,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a843ea9e61561daa579a/1:1/w_160/1cd2993e.jpg,2005-04-24 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2081-asap-the-afrobeat-sudan-aid-project/,Modiba Productions,"I'm hoping that the people reading this review are aware of the war in Darfur. Our media have shied away from calling it that, preferring the word genocide, which certainly applies, and the rather loathsome euphemism ""ethnic cleansing,"" a term I've always thought inadequate and much too polite for confronting human savagery at its worst. It is a war, though, separate from the decades-long fight that engulfed the southern half of Sudan until the signing of a peace agreement earlier this year, but similar to that conflict in that the totalitarian Sudanese central government has responded to local black African unrest with a coordinated campaign of destruction, allowing Arab militias known as Janjaweed carte blanche to burn, pillage, kill, and expel, even in areas where no uprising exists. The express purpose of the campaign, which is indisputably backed by the Sudanese regular military, is to erase Darfur's black African (I refer to them as opposed to the country's Arab population-- Sudan has a complicated ethnic and religious composition owing to its colonial background) population and their homes along with them. The resulting human flight from Darfur has brought thousands of refugees to neighboring Tchad, a nation in no financial or material shape to accommodate them, and various camps within Sudan, where they survive thanks mostly to international largesse. Without foreign eyes, it's likely that Sudan would simply press its offensive and proceed with its naked genocide-- unfortunately, the interest of foreign governments is fickle, and a brief outcry in the halls of the UN has devolved into ineffectual grandstanding and squabbling over how best to address the situation. Of course, the delicacy of governments like ours in dealing with the Khartoum regime is at least partially driven by interest in the oil resources that government controls, and it's left up to non-governmental organizations to provide aid, food and shelter for a massive displaced populace in a part of the world\xD0the eastern fringe of the Sahara-- not known for its hospitable conditions. This background established, ASAP: The Afrobeat Sudan Aid Project is a compilation aimed at providing funds for the sundry organizations involved in Darfur relief, and all proceeds from its sale go directly to the cause, with no profit to any of the parties involved-- the artists, Modiba Productions, Ben Cohen's True Majority and Apple's iTunes store, the latter two being the discs's exclusive distributors (True Majority offers the disc at its website, iTunes obviously offers a download). As the reviewer, I'll say up front that this is a charitable cause I believe in and that in my opinion the donation would be worth making regardless of the contents of the disc. The rating up top reflects perhaps a bit of that conviction on my part, but this caveat is almost unnecessary-- this compilation is solid from any perspective and represents a fine introduction to the modern descendants of the 1970s Afropop. It's a truly multinational mix, with performers from the U.S., Africa, and Europe, most of whom have called multiple continents home at some point in their lives. The American contingent revolves around New York City's modern Afrobeat orchestras, Antiabalas, Kokolo, and Akoya, and all have donated spectacular tracks for the cause. Antibalas offers a smoking live version of ""Uprising"" full of maniacal sax solos and burbling neo-Africa 70 rhythms, while Akoya's ""USA"" is a striking denouncement of unilateralism with a huge horn arrangement and a great vocal from Kaleta, an Afrobeat veteran who's recorded with both Fela Kuti and Fela's son Femi. Kokolo's two tracks are both excellent: ""Mister Sinister"" careens over whiplash horns into a dub midsection and ""More Consideration"" does something lyrically that almost no funk or Afrobeat ever does, lamenting the inequality of women in cultures the world over. The African artists, most of whom were born in Nigeria and are now based in the U.S., contribute songs in a wide array of styles, most of which are actually less indebted to Fela than their American counterparts. Ikwunga's ""Di Bombs"" is spoken poetry with a chugging Afrobeat backing, Ikwunga intoning evenly and calmly, ""Di jets di jets/ Di jets are built in Germany/ But the air raids are for Freetown/ The air raids are for Asmara."" Keziah Jones offers up thumping r&b; on ""Garan Garan,"" with an ultra-simple bass and drum groove backing up his vocal, which is based on an old Nigerian folk tune. Dele Sosimi and Franck Biyong & Massak each throw down monstrous slabs of deep Afrogroove, but the biggest revelation here might be Wumni, whose hyperkinetic dance track ""What a See"" is tailor-made for a post-M.I.A. world. She dives sweating into a sumptuous beat with rubbery rapping and spastic scatting for a result that's stunning and difficult to classify. For good measure, there's even a classic mid-70s Tony Allen track (""Progress"") to sweeten the deal, though by the time it shows up in the tracklisting, the disc has already proved its worth several times over. Like most charity releases, there's little direct relevance in most of these songs to what's happening in Darfur (the remix of Akoya Afrobeat Ensemble's ""Star Wars"" features samples from news reports on Darfur, and that's the only explicit mention), but unlike most charity releases, this has a cohesion and singularity of purpose that make it very listenable in one sitting. The way I see it, there are two reasons to check this out: First, it's a phenomenal introduction to current Afropop, and second, it's for a good cause. You don't often get to vote your conscience by buying a good record, so this gets my wholehearted recommendation.","This multinational compilation is aimed at providing funds for organizations involved in Darfur relief.

Rituals,John Zorn,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab3413d1975652139b7e/1:1/w_160/c5977be6.jpg,2005-04-24 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8932-rituals/,Tzadik,"When Rituals made its debut at the Bayreuth Opera Festival in 1998 it violently divided its audience, with half the crowd cheering in approval and the other half booing and heckling all the way to the exits, a vivid polarization one suspects to be precisely the reaction that John Zorn most desired. While listening to this handsome new studio recording of the piece, however, it's a little difficult to understand what exactly caused all the hubbub, as longtime Zorn aficionados are unlikely to even consider this to be one of his more confrontational or difficult works. Conducted here by Brad Lubman, Rituals is billed as an operatic monodrama in five movements for mezzo-soprano and 10 instruments. As with other recent Zorn works like 2002's IAO and last year's Magick, the piece draws inspiration from the abstruse, mystical writings of Aleister Crowley, although Rituals includes no libretto as such. In practice, this lack of lyrics serves to enhance the music's captivating, luminous intrigue, and heighten its mysterious incantatory energies. Short in length, Rituals is dense and focused, a model of understated restraint that contains none of Zorn's notorious interjections of thrash or noise. It's mezzo-soprano Heather Gardner who delivers what is the album's most immediately arresting performance. In what sounds to be an extremely physically demanding role, Gardner sails through the piece's wordless, meditative vocal cascades with power and grace. Throughout these five movements she provides just the right degree of opaque emotion, as Zorn cagily leaves it to the listener to decide if her impassioned calls are of agony, ecstasy, or some progression between the two. Constructing a backdrop behind Gardner's vocals is a motley ensemble of woodwinds, strings and percussion, and the group's inquisitive, nimble footwork is frequently reminiscent of Zorn's hero Carl Stalling. This is particularly true in the case of multi-tasking percussionist Jim Pugliese, whose wide-ranging duties here almost make him resemble a foley artist for an old-time radio drama. Utilizing such esoteric instruments as wind machines, bull-roarers, fishing reels, ""grave-digging,"" and bird calls-- for what mystical, alchemical purposes one can only speculate-- Pugliese provides Rituals with a considerable portion of its toothsome, perplexing drama. Clocking in at just over 20 minutes yet carrying the price tag of a full-length CD, Rituals is not likely to find many fans among bargain hunters. Neither will it hold much appeal for stuffy opera traditionalists or those who aspire to their ranks. But for established Zorn enthusiasts, Rituals is replete with moments to confound, enrich and delight, and will surely lure you to its darkened altar for frequent repeat ceremonies.","This operatic monodrama in five movements for mezzo-soprano and 10 instruments draws inspiration from the writings of Aleister Crowley.

The Sunset Tree,The Mountain Goats,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d9eb335119a49ed7ec/1:1/w_160/aea3dafe.jpg,2005-04-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5456-the-sunset-tree/,4AD,"Oh me oh my, The Sunset Tree has thrown me into a mini-crisis. That might seem like a big statement for such a small record, but rewind a decade: That's me, there, in a ""Welcome to the Inland Empire"" silk-screened Shrimper tee, unwashed hair, and horn-rimmed glasses, obsessing over the Mountain Goats' The Hound Chronicles cassette while stacking loaves of bread at a Southern New Jersey convenience store. Every night I'd steal a Snapple and drive home through the pines and deer alleys in my broken Chevy Impala with the windows down, blasting the Mountain Goats, Paste, Nothing Painted Blue (or whatever), on my tiny portable boom box. That teenage idealism followed me to college, too, when I gave the by-then hard-to-find Hot Garden Stomp cassette to a friend because he carried a picture of John Darnielle in his wallet-- I felt he deserved it. For years, the Mountain Goats' Sweden was my main signifier for that country. Whenever I saw the Swedish flag, I'd hum ""The Recognition Scene"". But as 2000 rolled around, I'd forgotten Darnielle existed. (Actually, in a way I thought he'd transformed himself into Rick Moody, or they were somehow a ghost-writing tag team.) My general loss of interest isn't meant to dismiss or simplify Darnielle's accomplishments. It's just that after memorizing the shivers induced by ""the most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you and that you are standing in the doorway"" perhaps I've already experienced the apex of Darnielle's poetics at my own personal ideal time/place. I no longer even own a car or a boom box and I rarely steal iced tea from the local bodega. And no, I'm not a low-fi purist, so it doesn't at all bother me that he's upped the production. In fact, the accompaniment of Peter Hughes, John Vanderslice, Franklin Bruno, Scott Solter, and Maldoror fan Erik Friedlander open things up here (as on his last few records), allowing Darnielle more space to take some breaths, work on atmosphere, introduce catchy piano trills, some distorted grinding noises, and cello swells. But yet my first few listens to The Sunset Tree, the Mountain Goats' third 4AD full-length and follow-up to last year's We Shall All Be Healed, left me cold, even though Darnielle axes his fictions and explores his own personal life, specifically an abusive stepfather. As one would hope from a songwriter as smart as Darnielle, ""The Sunset Tree"" comes from a 19th-century religious song, ""The Tyrolese Evening Hymn"" and as reported in Pitchfork news some time ago, ""Darnielle says he took it from a scene in Samuel Butler's semi-autobiographical novel The Way of All Flesh, where a clergyman beats his young son bloody because of a speech impediment that prevents the son from enunciating clearly while singing the hymn."" Still, even as said stepdad chucks a glass at mom's head and young JD runs up into his room to hide the shouts with dance music, the familiar staccato of those comforting cadences lulled instead of enlightened. Something I subconsciously learned when I was younger that I'm just now understanding is that the Mountain Goats' sound best after obsessively replaying each track until they become as familiar as your own personal memories. Accordingly, after a thousand and one listens, while I can still do without much of the second half of The Sunset Tree, on its first four songs Darnielle locates a stride, crafting a perfect four-part diorama. It's quite an accomplishment. Opener ""You Or Your Memory"" is a lonely motel-room, bare-foot epiphany fueled by St. Joseph's baby aspirin, Bartles & Jaymes, and a mirror. ""Broom People"" develops the domestic scenery for the album's drama: '36 Hudson in the garage, junk in an unattached spare room, ""white carpet thick with cat hair,"" dirty dishes, lots of ice cream in the freezer, ""friends who don't have a clue/ Well-meaning teachers,"" suicide notes in a spiral-ring notebook, and the girl who makes him feel alive: ""In the long tresses of your hair I am a babbling brook."" With a fast-car thematic that's an odd collision between Tracy Chapman's urgency and the romanticism of Jawbreaker's ""Chesterfield King""-- and brandishing the triumphant chorus, ""I'm gonna make it through this year if it kills me""-- ""This Year"" finds 17-year-old Darnielle breaking free from his ""broken house"" on a Saturday morning to play video games ""in a drunk haze"" while holding hands with a girl named Kathy. Of course, teenage celebrations come to an end: ""I drove home in the California dusk/ I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum/ Pictured the look on my stepfather's face/ Ready for the bad things to come."" Then there's the wonderful ""Dilaudid"", a coil of nervous energy and teenage thrill-seeking. Darnielle's backed by a full-on string crew and the bows are used in a quick/jaunty way, matching the machine-gun rate of hi claustrophobic and creepy salvos (i.e. teen horniness fueled by pain killers): ""Hike up your fishnets, I know you. If we live to see the other side of this, I will remember your kiss, so do it with your mouth open. And take your foot off of the brake, for Christ's sake."" After that, besides a cleaning-out-my-closet sing-a-long ""Up the Wolves"", The Sunset Tree loses steam. The late-period references to Kurt Cobain's suicide feel cheap and easy. Pieces of it go by unnoticed. Bits either blend into one another or wander. Oddly, at times it seems like Darnielle works more movingly and astutely when he's inventing his tales rather than partaking in personal anecdote and/or trauma. Then again, invention often possesses a more beautiful narrative arc than retreating to your bedroom to block out a parental argument. Really, though that first quartet is a wonderful example of what Darnielle can do when he's on-- draw characters and plot better than just about anyone holding a guitar.","On his third record for 4AD, John Darnielle axes his fictional sketches and explores his own personal life, specifically an abusive stepfather.

Hold Me to This: Christopher O'Riley Plays Radiohead,Christopher O'Riley,by: Stephen M.

Whereas most straight covers tend to remain either live-set whimsies or B-side obscurities (take John Mayer's ""Kid A""...or not), ivory-ticklers like Christopher O'Riley and Brad Mehldau have recorded not just one or two, but numerous Radiohead covers. This affinity doesn't seem too surprising, though, since the band is far more innovative musically than lyrically, and the sound of Yorke's vocals adds perhaps more tension and meaning to the lyrics than the words he sings. The band famously varies the complex meters, keys, structures, chord progressions, and tones of its songs, making them challenging workouts for musicians. Two years after releasing his first covers album, True Love Waits, O'Riley returns with another batch, titled Hold Me to This. Compared to Mehldau, who often records as one member of a trio, O'Riley is something of a purist: His arrangements are strictly for solo piano, with no overdubs or guest musicians. These are impressionist covers, loosely translating rather than strictly transcribing tone and atmosphere into the more constrained setting. O'Riley fares best when his piano merely suggests a melody, as on ""The Tourist"" and ""No Surprises"". Conversely, bold melodic lines don't work very well. On ""Like Spinning Plates"", while one hand plays the low, rumbling pattern, the other bangs out the central melody in glaring chords that sound altogether out of place amid the subtler texture. Culling material from every stage of Radiohead's career (although not necessarily in chronological order) into a particularly ambitious tracklist, he makes only a few obvious choices in songs: his ""Paranoid Android"" meanders even at a short five minutes, ""Sail to the Moon"" sounds like the instrumental track for the original, but ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" makes an effective album closer. Not surprisingly, he picks no tracks from Pablo Honey or Kid A, which dominated True Love Waits. Instead, he selects three from 2003's underrated Hail to the Thief. Almost half of Hold Me to This, however, is devoted to B-sides, which reveals his fan's obsession behind this project. ""Polyethylene Part II"" moves from quiet to thunderous fluidly, while ""Talk Show Host"", from the Romeo + Juliet soundtrack (remember that?), draws the arresting four-note melody out for seven minutes. Working out the complexities of Radiohead's textured music in a solo setting has its advantages-- a living-room intimacy among them-- but too often this constrained approach blurs the tracks together. Tonally, many of the songs on Hold Me to This often sound indistinguishable from each other, despite the range of source material. As a result, this album may end up as a novelty for Radiohead fans and perhaps a nonentity for everyone else.","Another album of Radiohead covers by pianist Christopher O'Riley.

Dutch Dub,Dutch Dub,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbac5e6ef95969322c7e/1:1/w_160/1412dd75.jpg,2005-04-21 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2605-dutch-dub/,Recordcollection,"I don't consider myself a musician, but I like to make little home recordings-- largely improvised, often cheesy keyboard/guitar ejaculations-- for fun and relaxation. My recording techniques leave a lot to be desired: Only two channels on my battered old Tascam four-track are still functioning, and you can often find me propping up a microphone right in front of a guitar amp or tiny, built-in keyboard speaker. I mention this because Dutch Dub (a solo project from Pretty Girls Make Graves' Nick deWitt) sounds a lot like one of the tapes piled in my closet. So how can I take Dutch Dub to task if I'm guilty of the same thing? Simple: I'm not trying to sell you mine. Indie dudes doing side projects in genres other than their own is nothing new, but deWitt definitely made a poor choice for his ""dabbling genre."" This take on dub sounds like deWitt basically stripmined a cheapie Casio's tone bank, directly miking the speakers. If you know anything about dub, you know it goes as well with tinny recording as bubblegum does with popcorn. Most modern listeners at least recognize dub in a ""know-it-when-we-hear-it"" sort of way, if only because of the genre's appropriation by Massive Attack, PiL, Pere Ubu; hell, even Sublime. A history of dub is uncalled for here, but it should be noted that production-- deep, echoing, cavernous, stark, drenched in reverb and delay-- is fundamental. Without it, you wind up with this: Monochromatic tones and repetitive rhythms running straight down the center of the mix, flat and affectless. There are no highs and lows here-- although perhaps the songs with gruffly emotive, muffled vocals are slightly more interesting-- just an ongoing low-grade annoyance, as the album runs through seventeen tracks that manhandle dub with a caricaturist's eye. ""Heat Up"" is all canned drums and what sounds like a Fisher Price electric piano. Bursts of static stand in for echoing space on ""Dare to Dream""; ""Dutch Waltz"" and many of its brethren could be mistaken for Nokia ringtones; ""Peanut Butter and Jelly Heart"" bleats and plinks into oblivion. Maybe deWitt's not ""serious"" about this record; maybe it's a tribute to kitsch or something. It's hard to tell, and even harder to care.","Pretty Girls Make Graves' Nick deWitt and his bedroom dub.

More on that in a second. First, Brazilian Girls, who are not actually Brazilian girls: They got their start in a club, and it shows: This stuff is all laid-back groove, with the usual transcontinental chic, easy-going house beats, and multilingual flourishes. But the club they came gliding out of is situated in downtown Manhattan, where the vibe these days is pretty far from VIP-lounge martini toasts. That fact goes a long way toward pegging what's special about them-- because no matter how much these immaculate grooves peek at glittery highlife, they're washed in such an earthy stoner vibe that they tend to wind up someplace else. So one track sounds like something to bump on the way to the club, and the next is a sunny lazybones dub number with a chorus that runs ""Pussy pussy pussy, marijuana."" Suddenly you realize that this stuff would charm the dreadlocked southern boys at Bonnaroo as much as designer-chic folk and arty brown-skinned girls. Universality! That's how we come back to this adulthood thing. You can throw this band in with a lot of current acts, but the vibe they've wound up resurrecting might have more to do with the stuff adult sophisticates were chilling out to in the late 80s. What might sound like Zero 7 actually sounds more like Sade, and when this crew is really on the ball you get flashes of insight: So this is how cool Paul Simon used to sound to 30-year-olds. If nothing else, they give us one unimpeachably great single, which in a long-gone sunny summer might have snuck up the charts like old-school Suzanne Vega. ""Don't Stop"" lets singer Sabina Sciubba work some slinky come-ons for a minute, the band combining live-groove keyboard feel with well-groomed beats. But when the chorus comes around, Sciubba starts skipping around her melody Simon-style, the band kicks it as sweet as a Phoenix single, and the whole thing blossoms into happy human basics: She just wants you to go to the park with her, maybe ""drink some tea and smoke some herb."" And of course you would, because Sciubba is a total charm, with a deep warm voice and a knack for human-girl lyrics. Oddly enough, it's her come-ons and chants that falter: She's better off asking, ""When and how did I become my mother,"" or going all Sade on ""Long"" and describing time as ""longer than your hair in the 80s."" The same goes for the music. The stoned horns and super-sunny island turns on ""Pussy"" do tourism as well as Simon ever did, while other tracks put a warmer spin on the kind of slick Euro spook we used to get from Goldfrapp. But Mediterranean bumps like the one on ""Corner Store"" try a little too hard, and the group's stabs at crowd-pleasing funk just don't shine on record like their laid-back pop does. Which leaves some of this material falling short of its peaks. One of the perks of being adult, though, is that you stop getting worked up about albums that won't be everything you want them to. A handful of winners, some respectable grooves, and a live show that has Sciubba dropping that line about her mother from underneath a blindfold: I'm good with this.

Slow Hands / Evil / C'Mere,Interpol,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1375e6ef95969320131/1:1/w_160/e75bf355.jpg,2005-04-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11761-slow-hands-evil-cmere/,Matador,"Oh, Interpol-- would that your love of Europe and the bands from that region extended to the way you treated your singles. Why, I remember back in the day when indie bands from the UK would cut more tracks than what would fit on the album, and then release those tracks as the B-sides on various singles. And sometimes, a band would even go back into the studio, cut more tracks, and include those on singles. Alas, what Interpol brings to the making of their albums ends up on the album-- the only non-radio-session, non-remix track on these three EPs is ""Song Seven"", a track that's been around since before the days of Turn on the Bright Lights. And, ""Song Seven"", unsurprisingly, is An Interpol Song-- morose, romantic, glistening, propulsive, yadda yadda. Put it on either album, and it blends right in. Put it on an EP pimping an album track, and it begs the question, ""Well, gee, it's nice and all, but why can't you guys include more originals on your singles?"" So what you, Interpol Fan, are left with, should you decide to purchase (or download) these EPs, are the one non-album original, six remixes, and three radio session tracks. The session tracks, available on the Evil EP, are from a Zane Lowe BBC Session. Unfortunately, none of Lowe's spastic nic-fitted chatter is included-- instead, it's just the music. Two songs from Antics (""NARC"", and, of course, ""Evil"") and ""Leif Erikson"" are essayed during this session. ""Leif Erikson"" (the Radio Session) sounds quite similar to ""Leif Erikson"" (the Album Track), so kudos to the group for that one. The Two Antics tracks, however, don't come off so well. If anything, they're prime evidence that producer Peter Katis should ask for more points when Interpol slips into Fairfield County to record that difficult third album. The performance of ""Evil"" in particular sounds rinky-dinky and wan , especially with the superior album version residing on the same disc. The Slow Hands EP, the weak sister in this bunch, features two remixes of the titular track. Britt Daniel treats the track like a Spoon song, which means that each instrument is actually a Lego block to be added and subtracted from the structure as seen fit. In doing so, Daniel brings out the disco in the track, successfully replacing the original's pensive shuffle with a cocky strut. Dan the Automator, the other remixer, treats ""Slow Hands"" the way a fraternity treats freshman pledges. He pulls out the original drum track, throws in a turgid approximation of the live drums with a drum machine and a stiff boom-kick, adds some bloops, bleeps, and squiggles (because, hey, it's a remix), and cashes his paycheck. If the indie kids dance to this, then it's clear they haven't learned a damn thing. Hope there's still time to cancel payment. That leaves the third and final EP, for C'Mere, the most straightforward (and, in my book, the best) track from the album. For this, each member of the band takes on an Antics track and does some rejiggering. Whether you read anything into the descriptions of these remixes and the member's contributions to the band is your own bag. Lead singer Paul Banks eschews the dance aspects of Interpol's sound, turning ""NARC"" into a spacious and specious solo performance, featuring a chord played ever five seconds, and Banks' voice smothered meekly in the background. Thankfully, the other three 'Polsters don't make the same mistake. Guitarist (and group founder) Daniel Kessler adds excessive pinging, ponging, and warping sounds to the track-- on first blush, it sounds like the work of a guy that just got ahold of the Come To Daddy EP. It's a grower, though, if you can get past the bucephalus bouncing ball in the introduction. Noted lothario Carlos D. takes on ""Public Pervert"" (ha ha ha), accentuating the sex by adding a slinky slow disco vibe to the track. And, of course, with Carlos D. being the group's bass player, there is plenty of focus on the bass. I would play the Sounds Like New Order (In a Good Way) card on Carlos' effort, but I'm saving those kudos for ""Fog Vs. Mould for the Length of Love"". That's Fog as in drummer Samuel Fogarino (the group's secret weapon), and Mould as in Bob Mould, an up-and-coming DC-area DJ best know for the monthly DJ event (Blowoff) he co-hosts. (Mould's also done a little guitar playing for some bands-- I'd drop names, but y'all know how to Google, or browse your iPods.) Fog & Mould stretch the love length out to nearly eight minutes, dropping in and out of the track expertly, with the new polyrhytmic backbeat pushing things forward. And, not unintentionally, the bookending sets of crackling static give the affair a white label mystique. Hola, Hacienda! Just remember, kids-- know your pills, buddy up, and drink plenty of water.","With ""C'Mere"" lodged in the UK top 20, we round up Interpol's Antics EPs.

DJ-Kicks,The Glimmers,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ad9d034d5c69bf279f/1:1/w_160/8f694129.jpg,2005-04-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3673-dj-kicks/,!K7,"Twins until a ridiculously prissy lawsuit, Belgium's Glimmers bastard-mix like (and unlike) fellow countrymen Soulwax, counterbalancing any disinterest in the motherfucking remix with simply riskier selections. Even on dabbler discs, Hall & Oates and War and De La can throw for damn hard loops, and yet they were all together on the duo's first Eskimo mix in 2000, ta-da. Glimmers' DJ-Kicks entry jams electro and rock and disco-- era-deviant and occasionally generous, 18 good-to-great songs all impeccably beatmatched-- but the mix does seem somewhat tame next to their earlier recordings, not to mention recent DJ-Kicks spots from Chicken Lips and Erlend Øye. The furthest Glimmers wander from garage (and fake-garage), late 80s house, and throwback italo is into campier numbers such as Bis' cover ""Shack Up"" and choice gay disco cut Ragtyme's ""Fix It Man"". But even then, ""If your drain is clogged, I got something for the job"" is no ""don't pass out goin' down on me/ Or I'll wake you up with a mouthful of pee."" Suum cuique, but for me the mix works infinitely better with less to prove and fewer to please-- and feels much more confident and listenable given the relative continuity of its constituent parts. My ""dilettantism blew its load six months ago"" riff is just hot air, I bet; let's just say I've enjoyed more streamlined tracklistings that play records or sell a sound rather than the 90-second-track, genre-challenging pissing contests celebrated (it seems) simply for existing. Love the 'roid ragers-- Idjut Boys' edit of Bohannon's ""The Boogie Train"", Kerri Chandler's garage-to-deephouse timewarp ""Disco Satisfaction"", Kaos' ""Feel Like I Feel (Sing Along)"" (faster here, and more awesome with every listen)-- but respect the team players too, especially heavy dubs like Big Two Hundred's ""Approach And Pass With Contact"" and Lindstrøm's ""Kosmisk Klubbkveld"". And yet tracks this strong the Glimmers let stand alone and never merely as set-ups, perhaps reinforcing the mix's spine at the expense of a few dance-is-boring, give-me-pop whimperers. I'm afraid I never really ""got"" Two Lone Swordsmen, nor have I ever appreciated the permanent aux percussion cocktease that is Rub N Tug's overglorified reedit of Chicago's ""I'm a Man"", so in my mind the Glimmers finish up a bit backwards. At the end I'm left with two impressions. First, I respect the duo's relative selflessness. They keep the focus on the tracks and tell a good post-garage story. Second, ""this is good electro-house-disco mix, but I can't really tell it apart from the billion others I've heard.""","Latest entry in !K7's rewarding series is an eclectic mix helmed by the former Glimmer Twins.

Central Hug/Friendarmy/Fractaldunes (And the Dreams that Resulted),Emperor X,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bccaeb335119a49ecd46/1:1/w_160/d29d88e2.gif,2005-04-20 05:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11736-central-hugfriendarmyfractaldunes-and-the-dreams-that-resulted/,Disco Mariscos,"Let's just use Emperor X's metaphor: One time, Chad Matheny and some friends scrape together just enough junk-- rope, poles and tarp-- to make a man-sized kite, a pre-Wright Brothers low-tech flying device, and they strap themselves in and jump into the winds of a hurricane to catch a few seconds of gust outside Jacksonville, Florida. Just as the ad hoc construction of the wing didn't stop it from taking wind, the aesthetic of Emperor X's recording belies its craft. Homemade and sometimes grungily recorded, the latest record by Chad Matheny's one-man band delivers jitter-- and indie pop that practically gnaws its own arm with excitement. Central Hug/Friendarmy/Fractal Dunes (a single album named as if it were a collection of EPs) has the same aesthetic as last year's Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip on an Edgeless Platform, but the pace is quicker. Matheny's urgent screams are like Travis Morrison's speak-sing, but while he tempers the album with typical indie ballads (""The Citizens of Wichita"", ""Ainseley""), it's frenzied anthems like ""Edgeless"" that sell this junkheap. Matheny built the record from tinny beats and synths, guitar scraped like by nails as if against files, imagery both lucid and absurd, and bass and percussion that wander in so casually you could forget that he recorded and meticulously overdubbed the parts by himself. He tempers his inventiveness with willful crudeness-- as on the closing instrumental, where he changes the tempo by just knocking down the tape speed. And while there are as many beats as guitars-- ""Sfearion"" is enthusiastic indietronica, with whomping bass near the end-- the synths are as refreshingly rough as the rest of the music: The poppiest songs are fuzzed out and distorted, but still fit for dancing, or at least for hurtling yourself in place. It's easy to act nonchalant about lo-fi, four-track wizardry, and in the post-Microphones, post-Postal Service world, we underrate the use of beats, new textures or inventive overdubs because we insist that originality won't make a record engaging. But Central Hug doesn't settle for sounding ""original"" or ""clever"": It nakedly gives a shit about itself, as Matheny assembles his album with tape and cheap wire, building it quickly before the hurricane passes and stretching it to the breaking point with the shout that's scrawled across the disc's face, ""GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO...""","Inventive, willfully crude rock from Chad Matheny.

Elevators and Oscillators,Solvent,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a688c0084474cd0c09b4/1:1/w_160/b5562b8b.jpg,2005-04-20 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7783-elevators-and-oscillators/,Ghostly,"Last June, Solvent released Apples and Synthesizers, an elegant little pop suite that very politely brought the world up to date on all his latest modular synth settings. The only problem with it was that it was a little boring, which albums like that often are. Plenty of people try and wow us with their knob-twist symphonies, and unless there's something particularly distinctive about them, they come out kind of specialized and geekoid: I'm as into oscillator settings as anyone, but keeping track of whose sine-waves modulate better feels as academic as clocking every garage-rock single to come along. Solvent's Kraftwerk pulse and peculiar pop sensibility kept the record likeable, but it couldn't make it all that striking. Thankfully, there's also Elevators and Oscillators, an album companion to the LP proper. Solvent's catalog works like most dance act's-- meditative on the albums, floor-conscious on the singles-- and the remakes and remixes collected here deliver on some of those more vivid 12"" pleasures. In and around five new songs, a variety of participants put spins on the guy's singles juice, including three takes each on ""For You"" and the career-making ""My Radio"". And, well: Secondary ""companion"" though this may be, sonic variety and looser beats let the results pop in a way the album couldn't. Germans help, obviously. Alter Ego, for instance, come along to turn ""Think Like Us"" into a trendily harsh robot-rocker; turned up loud enough, it might be just the thing for 2raumwohnung fans and Daft Punk disappointees. Schneider TM takes things in exactly the opposite direction, remaking ""My Radio"" as a skittery indie pop song, complete with mutated acoustic guitar plucks, boyish vocals, and a revised indie-kid lyric. Low-country headbanger Legowelt covers the same track with his usual spooky growl, though he doesn't go nearly as lovably grim as usual; Mitgang Audio remix it with some added electro strut. Lowfish puts a dream-sheen on ""For You"", Isan go ahead and make it fully subliminal, and then JDSY come along to beat all with the most arresting thing here-- raw non-robot vocals over an gorgeous, chiming build. Fold in those new Solvent tracks, and it's a treat for anyone who dug Apples and Synthesizers. Fold them out, and it'd still be a workable comp-- a nice, versatile handful of post-electro sounds for those who weren't quite up for 45 minutes of Solvent's private time. How excited do you get about hardware?","New and reworked tracks from Solvent, including three takes each on ""For You"" and ""My Radio"".

Relaxation of the Asshole,Robert Pollard,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d19d034d5c69bf27f2/1:1/w_160/3d6fcf38.jpg,2005-04-20 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6383-relaxation-of-the-asshole/,Rockathon,"If more drunks would learn from Robert Pollard, simply accept his teachings, alcoholism wouldn't be treated-- it would be celebrated. An alcoholic risks losing his family and his job, systematically alienating all who would ever respect or care for him; Robert Pollard is loved, adored, and urine-free. Surely this career arc is the very embodiment boozing success, a seminal text on how to drink professionally for more than a decade. The secret directions to the Bizarro dimension Pollard inhabits, however, have until now been well-concealed, only unearthed from the occasional between-song words of wisdom doled out at GBV gigs, and impossible to accurately assemble into a true life-plan. With the tearful passing of GBV's live act, it seemed as though the teachings would be lost forever, but listen up, drunky, because there's hope: Relaxation of the Asshole, like the Rosetta Stone of Inebriation, is the first step towards making sense of the the Man, the Wisdom, and the ins and outs of a healthy career in alcoholism. Yes, this most definitely is a CD of stage banter, Uncle Bob's rants, and nothing but. Let the record show that you have been warned: The only precedent I can think of (and painstakingly verified by minutes of searching) is Having Fun on Stage With Elvis. Now, if anyone deserves that treatment more than Elvis (and lots do, for sure-- we should make a rule that 20 years of touring and at least one band member with a substance abuse problem makes one of these albums mandatory), it's Uncle Bob. The similarities are manifest, as both have performed some of the most classic rock songs of all time (of, uh, varying levels of renown). The difference, of course, is that at the time of Elvis' recording, he was a pill-addled super-heavyweight surrounded with yes-men eager to milk a buck from a fan base dumb enough to pay for an album of ""thank ya""'s and ""uh-huh""'s, while, conversely, every time Bob bitches about Adam Duritz, I kind of secretly wish that he was my dad. And by now you've surely seen the rating. On the scale of artist indulgence, and by any other measure for that matter, this is a solid 10.0 if ever there was one, friends. This-- this-- is a 10 as surely as Metal Machine Music is a 10, as surely as Having Fucking Fun on Stage With Elvis is a 10, as surely as any exercise so bafflingly, inexplicably, unintentionally and intentionally hilarious even in concept is a 10; good god-- what the hell else can this album receive? The rating is inconsequential. It's either a 10 or a zero, and considering Bob is the reigning king of intoxicated concert rambling it's sure as hell not a zero, m'man. A single listen will verify this. Behold! ""Rolling Stone just published a list of the top 100 guitar players of all time-- and they included Joan Jett. How can you fuckin' put Joan Jett in the top 100 guitar players of all time? Ahead of Pete Townshend! Rolling Stone sucks! They can blow me forever! If anyone here is from Rolling Stone they can blow me. You want some payola? Here's some payola, motherfuckers!"" Gold. ""To everyone that says we have a drinking problem, we say 'Fuck you.' I said it to my mom."" Golder. ""I wanna know how the guy from the Counting Crows used to fuck everybody from 'Friends'? How the fuck'd he do it? He's an ugly motherfucker! He's fatter than me! What the fuck's he got? Money."" See?! This isn't some album you listen to because you enjoy listening to it, let alone more than once-- oh no. This isn't the summer jam for a cruise round the OC or the soundtrack to your formative years as a misunderstood adolescent. This is a long-view textbook interspersed with cheering and unintelligible phrases; you study it, you internalize it, and then you go forth and lead a better life. Subsequent listens are irrelevant-- why keep meditating once you've reached nirvana? When it comes to drinking for a living, you learned from the best; never look back.",,0.0,
Run War,Enduser,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6cc0084474cd0c2aaf/1:1/w_160/294bd88e.gif,2005-04-20 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2784-run-war/,Ad Noiseam,"Breakcore's presupposed lack of borders is a ruse. Like all genres, it's got its stylistic hallmarks: bass mutations, jungle breakbeats, and plenty of brazenly stolen samples. Other flavors-- embolism gabba, cock rock, Irish jigs-- come afterwards. It can be played absurdly fast or at hip-hop tempo. It can be silly, menacing, painful, or euphoric, but it's rarely soothing, sexy, or meditative. Enduser is a breakcore artist by dint of association, but he's also released records on mainstream drum'n'bass don Dylan's Outbreak label. Dylan, and by extension Enduser, falls into the ""beat that shit with a spike fuckin bat"" school of jungle. And sure enough, there's plenty of spork-in-yr-earhole bass (some enterprising bedroom DJ should see about mashing up ""Dubplate #12"" with Lil Jon's ""What U Gon' Do"") and bronco rides across overmodulated snares of death. But he finds wiggle room even within the most oppressive of templates. The titular characters of ""Dissin Monks"" chant along with the serrated beats, adding an almost comical atmosphere of gothic portentousness. ""Diggin Graves"" is thrombosis-hop, all pixilated 8-bit beat edits and a brittle, digital, chirruping loop that sounds like Mego's Pita gone funky. (I won't mention everyone Enduser samples on Run War, both to save his lawyer some work and to keep the spotters happy.) Most amazingly, he reaches occasionally for real, traditional beauty. The immaculately turned out post-Aphex atmospherics of ""ESB Rmx"" are pretty gorgeous on their own. Then he adds a surging bassline that would be a balm on any junglist dancefloor. But he tops off with a yearning Bollywood vocal, possibly pitched up slightly to play on its essential Kanye chipmunkness. This is one of those aesthetic choices that separates genius from pretender. Run War isn't perfect. It falls apart a little in the home stretch as it veers sharply into gabba tempo, drill'n'bass beats, and general silliness. (This sort of post-Kid606 DSP abuse is common enough in breakcore to make me wary. Do we really need more tracks combining Destiny's Child + distorted 200bpm snare rushes?) But he rallies with ""Glock Dub"", a scowling take on (I think) the ""Scorpio"" break that's smacked about by some truly painful bass distortion. On his blog recently, DJ/rupture castigated the post-jungle underground for its essentially conservative nature. Fair enough: I've certainly heard plenty of rote ""Amen"" + ragga over the last 12 months. But jungle's vocabulary is there to be used, as with 12-bar blues or the hip-hop breaks that inspired it in the first place. The historical burden of innovation has been traded for the aesthetic burden of interest. And when it stays below 180bpm and doesn't trade the funk for a whoopie cushion, Run War proves Enduser can take the weight.","Bass mutations, jungle breakbeats, and plenty of brazenly stolen samples share space with moments of beauty on Enduser's latest record.

The Milk of Human Kindness,Caribou,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7379d034d5c69bf3733/1:1/w_160/63513f9d.jpg,2005-04-20 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1805-the-milk-of-human-kindness/,LeafDomino,"When Dan Snaith's Manitoba released Up in Flames in early 2003 it felt like a debut. Bearing little resemblance to the cuddly IDM of 2001's Start Breaking My Heart, Up in Flames felt like the work of another mind, and logic dictated that the project should have a different name. The Gods of Music apparently agreed but were a little slow on the uptake; finally sensing the marked shifts in tone and focus they sent Handsome Dick Manitoba of the Dictators to smite the project. Papers were served, a trade infringement lawsuit was threatened, and Caribou was born. Bummer that the record racks of the world are going to get more confusing, but in purely musical terms the name change isn't such a bad thing. The Milk of Human Kindness sounds once again like an album from a band without a past, a band ready to take risks and go where the music needs to go. The contrast between The Milk of Human Kindness and Up in Flames is certainly less pronounced than the jump from the debut, but the feel here-- clearer arrangements and better songs, both more expansive and comparatively sober-- is new to Snaith. I should explain that when I say that Caribou sounds like a band without a past, I mean a past of their own. Certain historical strands from the last 35 years or so of rock are easy to discern. Where Up in Flames referenced spiraling psychedelia, this record is more controlled, carefully choosing its moments and arranging peaks for maximum impact. The most obvious addition to the sound is a strong dose of Krautrock, particularly the classic propulsion of Neu! The opening riff of ""Bees"", for example, takes a handful of Booker T & the MGs' ""Green Onions"" and spreads them like flares along the Autobahn of ""Hallo Gallo"". That's only the bedrock rhythm, and as the song progresses Snaith indulges his fondness for dynamic builds and folds in a chorus of horns that lead to a booming drum crescendo. ""A Final Warning"" is another strong motorik beat and this time Snaith rides the efficient engine through the kandy-kolored dreamland of the Boredoms' Vision Creation Newsun, exploding from dark tunnels into a vast, yawning mother sky with a wailing ""Ahhh!!!!"" The noisier tracks here are a lot of fun-- the spazzy ""Brahminy Kite"" is all cymbal crash and tom roll, its martial pulse and tinny organ contrasting with a repeating vocal refrain. The flipside of these drum-heavy tunes (which you know the band is aching to play live) is ""Hello Hammerheads"", an upfront and folksy vocal where Snaith aims for Simon and Garfunkel territory and winds up in the same area code, which is saying something considering how ""just another instrument"" his crooning can be. Tying the various strands together are a well-crafted series of minute-or-two interludes, which move from Lynchian melodrama (""Subotnick"") to manipulated bits of warped baroque (""Drumheller""). Some of the ""big"" tracks remind me of the gothic reconfigurations of DJ Shadow, particularly the dramatic build-of-steam ""Pelican Narrows"", with its melancholy ""Theme From the Incredible Hulk"" piano theme and loose, splashy drumbeat, but also the gangly interlude ""Lord Leopard"". The Shadow feel is doubly interesting because, though Snaith is currently leading a full band when out on tour, complete with two drummers, he brings a record fan's approach to his music. He's digging into the past to find the best bits and combining the new ways, reinforcing the idea, suggested at on earlier Manitoba material, that his particular genius is curatorial rather than strictly inventive. However he does it, he's created another thrilling, excellent record. ","On the first album released under his Caribou moniker, Dan Snaith mostly eschews the spiraling psychedelica of Up in Flames; instead he creates clearer arrangements and better songs, both more expansive and comparatively sober.

Tortoise: Achilles, have you seen this? Achilles: What? Tortoise: Do you see? Yes? I'm referring to the object, though small in size, quite interesting in stature, I am holding in front of you now. Achilles: It's a CD. Tortoise: Brilliant! I can see I have come to the right man. Achilles: ... Tortoise: Never one for suspense, I'll begin the next phase of our conversation: It is a new album from one of my country's most respected groups of musicians, Autechre. Achilles: Okay. Tortoise: And I am holding it in my hands. Achilles: Okay. Yeah, I heard a new one was coming out or something. Tortoise: Or something indeed, for I think it may be their best. Better even than the fine Confield. Do you remember the one? Achilles: Yeah, to be honest, I kinda stopped listening to them a few years back. I liked the first one, I think I liked EP7. I don't really remember much about it. Tortoise: I would happily grant you a very big favor in return for a moment of your time as I explain to you my thoughts on this record. Might you humor me? Achilles: Hey, hand that to me. Over here. Thanks. Yeah, whatever. Tortoise: Thank you. For starters, it's called Untilted. Isn't that funny? ""Un-til-ted."" They really do have a good sense of humor, don't you think? Achilles: Um, not really. It's kind of stupid. Tortoise: Well, I think it's a decent title all the same. But funnier still, I will admit, is that it's comprised of eight letters. Achilles: Oh shit, yeah, that's hilarious. Tortoise: Which is to say, funny when I recall that their previous album's title was also comprised of exactly eight alphanumeric characters (not counting the colon, of course). As was the full length before that-- Confield. Don't you think that's strange? Achilles: No. Tortoise: And even stranger still, Autechre-- A-U-T-E-C-H-R-E-- has the identical number of characters. Why, when I happened upon this, I was struck by the similarity in form. Achilles: Okay, way to go off the deep end. Are you going to tell me now that they're geniuses and I can learn trig faster by listening to them? I mean, what's funny is I might actually study to them more if I could hear a beat somewhere. Tortoise: As it happens, I do believe they are masters of form. But then I also believe they are as instinctively driven as any other musician, if that's not a contradiction (and I don't necessarily believe it is). Take ""Pro-Radii"", the third track: It begins with pounding, industrial-machinery sounds, as if stomping through a foggy alley using meter-thick blocks of iron as shoe souls. Yet, it slowly mutates into something lighter, with stuttering snare and what sounds like a digital sitar drone in the background. Achilles: You sound like a critic. Tortoise: And I haven't even gotten to the punchline! As it changes into something even further removed from the weighty opening, as eerie overtones ring above the pinging, metallic percussion, I realize the piece has arrived at this point in segments, lengthy and subtle, but obviously delineated to be sure. This, or course, is exactly the same scheme much of the dance music-- that with a ""beat""-- follows. Measure by measure, units of 8, 16, 32, 64-- it proceeds formally, yet changes its ""colors"" quite unpredictably. Achilles: Hey, hand me my bag. Tortoise: And the first piece, ""Lcc""-- Achilles: haha Tortoise: --""Lcc"", with its rapid-fire artillery precision, tight snare, and clear, metered rhythm, could easily be mistaken for dance music. In fact, I'd move some limbs for you, but would hate to influence your judgment negatively. Achilles: Next. Tortoise: Achilles, if you'd listen, you'd hear that the beat you are looking for is here, and an especially well-put-together one at that. Autechre are rightfully accused of being influenced by hip-hop, even as I imagine a rapper laying behind the beat might find himself on the wrong side of ""1"" from time to time. Achilles: So, you're saying it's got an interesting beat as long as you don't expect any kind of groove. And you know what? It's not even like I'm turning to Autechre for ""grooves."" Where the fuck did all the cool IDM even go? Like three years ago, you couldn't stop finding cool shit, shit that nobody'd ever heard before. Tortoise: I'm saying that interest is found where you are sufficiently motivated to look. ""Fermium"" would fit perfectly in the Berlin mix you made for your nephew. A little busier, perhaps, but... Achilles: Oh man, I forgot I was supposed to copy that for that board chick. Fuck, hey, can I use your computer? The library's closed today. Tortoise: The point is, despite their abstraction over the last few years, Autechre aren't an altogether different beast than when they started. In fact, they're smarter, more refined. Achilles: Look, I'll grant you they sound more complicated, but so the fuck what? I mean, I heard Draft 7:30. I liked it at first, until I realized all this form and content or whatever you're talking about is totally transparent. Dance music? Come on man, you need a more than ""beat"" to make dance music. If anything, I think they're out of ideas; throwing in a bunch of random shit to hide the fact that they peaked about seven years ago. Tortoise: My point is, I am still moved by this music. Not just the form, not just the hidden beats and seemingly chaotic shifts in meter. I believe artists are those who instinctively recognize the ways of things, and translate them in ways ultimately true to their spirit. Ours is a ""seemingly chaotic"" world, but underneath the maze of people and opinions, there is order, truth, and beauty. And maybe, just maybe, Autechre have the rare gift of showing us just where we stand, turbulence and all. Achilles: And my point is, if it's driven by form, it's a pretty messy, lazy form-- certainly no more structurally sound than any other software wank music. On top of that, if I'm supposed to ""feel"" this, to pick up on some obscure metaphysical in-joke, I'm not-- isn't it the job of a good artist to make that shit clear? Either way, it fails for me. Autechre decided to go their own way, fine, you know, just don't expect me to call them ""geniuses."" Tortoise: [Sigh] Alright, Achilles, I can see we're going to have to agree to disagree.

Absencen,Kammerflimmer Kollektief,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb67c0084474cd0c2852/1:1/w_160/634c723d.jpg,2005-04-19 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4382-absencen/,Staubgold,"Over the course of four albums, German sextet Kammerflimmer Kollektief have woven mesmerizing instrumental Möbius strips, casually twisting and braiding various strands of ambient drones, free jazz, and moody, Angelo Badalamenti-like atmospherics into deceptively immovable, impenetrable knots. And though their latest work, Absencen, overturns few new stones, this thoughtfully organized album finds the extended group operating at peak levels of cohesion and features some of their most adventurously textured compositions to date. One of the great band names of our times, Kammerflimmer Kollektief translates to ""Shimmering Collective"", and began its existence back in the late 90s as the one-man ambient project of composer and multi-instrumentalist Thomas Weber. The music contained on Absencen, however, has clearly been formed and fitted by more than one pair of hands, with several of tracks here co-written by harmonium player Heike Aumüller and one attributed to an improvisation by bassist Johannes Frisch. The album's inclusive temperament extends to its instrumentation as well, with each of the Kollektief's members allowed an equal voice in the mix to give these pieces their rich, fluid density. On several tracks the group's sound is augmented by the exotic pedal steel flourishes of Trapist's Martin Siewert, an addition that joins with Heike Wendelin's violins to further lengthen the shadows of the group's already canyon-wide sound. This combination is particularly potent on ""Unstet (Für Jeffrey Lee Pierce)"", an appropriately high and lonesome tribute to the late Gun Club leader that also blends harmonica and acoustic guitar into a stately, elegiac drone incorporating elements of the traditional tune ""Shenandoah"". Other such standouts include the brief, lovely ""Hausen"", which marries jazzy reeds to wistful country strains, and the opening ""Lichterloh"", a restless narrative that glides across acres of placid ambient swells before being rent asunder by D. Wurm's skronking saxophone blurts and Weber's space age keyboard effects. Elsewhere, on such tracks as ""Nachtwache, 15. September"" the Kollektief does occasionally stumble through relatively uninspired passages of polite fusion, resulting in music that settles too cozily into the ranks of the merely pretty. Thankfully, such moments on Absencen are rare, and are outnumbered by the impressive likes of ""Die Vögel Sangen Drauben Ihre Ungereimte,"" an epic closer featuring Weber and the rest of the group in full exploratory mode, as they forge ahead inquisitively, leaving an ever-shifting, endlessly fascinating array of discarded sounds in their wake.","This thoughtfully organized album features some of the German sextet's most adventurously textured compositions.

How to Prosper in the Coming Bad Years,Hank,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c173abf31b7dc715660b/1:1/w_160/6fab1864.jpg,2005-04-19 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4006-how-to-prosper-in-the-coming-bad-years/,Blocks,"This is the era of the short attention span, as people who grew up with video games, MTV, and the infant stirrings of media saturation begin to take over and build a world that meets their quick-paced, multi-tasked expectations. I'm not yet sure what my cluttered mind makes of this yet-- as with anything, there's plenty of upside and corresponding downside. Regardless, we plunge forward into this new, fast world further every day, and there's lately been a surge in the number of albums that explode with song shrapnel, tossing ideas like brown rice and mixed vegetables and leaving further development to the imagination or later records. Case in point is this Hank record, a sardine job that packs 15 songs into 28 minutes, slicing and dicing pop and punk songs and feeding them to a cheerleading competition. The Hank collective lurk somewhere in Toronto, a group of enthusiastically amateur female vocalists and instrumentalists swirling around a bearded Canadian guy called Cab who sings alternately with a kind of cockney sneer borrowed from late-70s English punk, an indie boy shout, and a country-ish baritone. What you'd call the overall result of this is up for some debate: ""Spazz-pop"" ignores the fact that there are bite-sized ballads in this mix, but it works for the uptempo songs, which constitute the majority, while other modern rock crit hyphenates all fall short on some account or another. Their are also dabs of early hip-hop, and the only thing I can really think of to compare it directly to is the Go! Team, though they're not as saturated or noisy as that band. Hank's hodgepodge sonic jumble is full of wildly disparate elements-- a pounding kickdrum mixing it up with spluttering piano on one track; a jagged, disjointed guitars stabbed by buzzing bass on the next. Steadfastly unprofessional vocals act as the crazy glue that sticks everything together in a big, exuberant wad. As random and tangential as the album's flow is, though, it's obvious that it's a carefully designed trainwreck, sort of a Rube Goldberg deal where the train going off the tracks is just the first in a series of events that leads to an egg being cooked. Take ""The Earless"", for example: Record scratching, violent glockenspiel, Cab's freaked-out cockney and the girls' loose harmonies look like a mess at first, but the way they come together undeniably makes for a bracing concoction. The song that follows, ""Heswall Diesel"", is comparatively straightforward and one of the album's best. A heavy, whomping beat, churning post-punk guitars and a crunching bassline lay down the attack while two-part female harmonies announce, ""I'm going out to do some heavy petting."" Unexpected pauses heighten the danceability of it, at least until it suddenly morphs into a depressive guitar dirge with a guy whispering ""dead friends"" over the top. On the whole, this is a warped trip that deserves to bring some attention to Hank as the upstart provocateurs they seem to be. Of course, that's perhaps a bit complicated by the fact that the album was initially issued in a limited edition of 500, each of which had different artwork by Hank member Paige Gratland. Hopefully, they'll be trotting it out in a wider release soon so more people can get their hands on it, but for the meantime, it's a highly enjoyable if questionably sane statement of purpose.","About a million years after Hank turned our editor-in-chief's head, we give this Blocks band its due.

Micah P. Hinson and the Gospel of Progress,Micah P. Hinson,by: Stephen M.

Hinson moved to Abilene, Texas, when he was just a child. As a teenager, he saw his share of trouble, falling in with a storybook femme fatale (a model and widow of a local rock musician, even) and serving a brief stint in county lock-up-- all before his twentieth birthday. This backstory, touted in his press materials, sounds almost too good to be true, but there's no reason to think it's any kind of fabrication. The point, besides, is not that Hinson has desert cred, but that his Tennessee-to-Texas trajectory parallels that of Willie Nelson and other outlaw country singers who fled Nashville for more sympathetic climes. Of course, Hinson isn't running from the mainstream, and he has no concentrated center against which to define himself, but he makes music-- specifically, his self-titled debut with the Gospel of Progress, a motley group that seemingly consists of any number of musicians playing twice as many instruments-- obviously on his own terms, which is less revolutionary today than it was thirty years ago, but still important. His debut is, in some ways, similar to Nelson's Red-Headed Stranger: Both are concept albums about the painful dissolution of a relationship and the dire self-reckoning that inevitably follows. However, instead of going on a murderous spree across the range, Hinson's protagonist gets lost within himself: ""I've been waiting so long up in these trees,"" he sings on ""The Day Texas Sank to the Bottom of the Sea"", ""trying to hang myself with thoughts of you, thoughts of me."" It's a vague metaphor with vaguely country-music wordplay, but it defines these songs as exorcisms of memory, music as a form of healing, or progress. Lyrically, Hinson is a stark minimalist. These 14 songs are uniformly plain-spoken and concise, and they tend to repeat a phrase or a verse, worrying it until it becomes frayed around the edges. ""Don't You"" pulls apart a five-word plea\xD1""Don't you forget about me""-- until it's positively threadbare, and on ""I Still Remember"", Hinson and Sarah Lewes sing the same verse back and forth, changing only the pronouns to juggle the blame. This approach proves deceptively simple, playing up the ambiguity of so few words. On the album opener, ""Close Your Eyes"", he comforts a lover with sweet words: ""Close you eyes and don't you make a sound/ There's no worries now, there's no one else around to hear you cry."" But are these words really so innocent? Couldn't he just as likely be sending her to her death as to sleep, similar to the ambiguous beginning of Red-Headed Stranger? Musically, this debut is lovingly and exactingly orchestrated with an array of instruments-- not just the usual piano, cello, and drums, but also flute, organ, melodica, and horns-- that subtly shade the songs' emotions. Strangely, however, Hinson entertains few possibilities and seems to rely too heavily on his acoustic guitar to shape the tracks. The opener, ""Close Your Eyes"", sets the general tone for the album, which (despite the apocalyptic chorus of ""At Last, Our Promises"") doesn't really break until track 10, ""Patience"", during which Hinson's imperturbably hangdog vocals reach a feverish holler and his anger spews forth. Unfortunately, a few of the preceding tracks-- namely, ""The Nothing"" and ""Stand in My Way""-- lose their distinctiveness and blur into each other, creating a mid-album lull that bends toward maudlin. After that respite, however, Hinson speeds the album to its gospel climax on ""The Day Texas Sank to the Bottom of the Sea"", which proves a near-perfect finale both musically and lyrically. The song's heavenward crescendo and the absolving catharsis both sound well-earned.","Texas singer/songwriter and Rough Trade Shops fave releases his engaging debut LP.

Suspended Animation,Fantômas,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4bc0084474cd0c2c83/1:1/w_160/3a76a5d5.gif,2005-04-19 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2990-suspended-animation/,Ipecac,"Apparently Fantômas read their own reviews. A year after critics and listeners alike griped over Delirium Cordia's one-track, 74-minute masturbatory venture into horror-film scores and spook-metal, Mike Patton pulls a complete 180 with Suspended Animation. Hated 74-minute tracks? Patton splits his new record into 30 tracks (chronologically named after a day in April 2005), with most falling short of the two-minute mark. Turned off by the whole horror thing? Well, Patton's got a cute little twist-- horror and death metal are still prevalent on Suspended Animation, but to lighten things up, Fantômas borrow from the playful, nostalgic world of cartoons. And yet the album still suffers from the same flaws that hampered Delirium Cordia. With the average track spanning less than 90 seconds, musical ideas either bleed from one song to the next or don't sustain themselves long enough to register in the listener's head. The 30 tracks thus fuse into one 44-minute conglomerate, making the album a truncated, accelerated version of Delirium. And as for the light-hearted ""Looney Tunes"" motif, let's just say Patton's idea of good ol' fashioned Saturday morning programming is less ""Duck Tales"" than it is ""Tales From the Crypt"". Just as nearly every horror film nowadays contains a climax where some six-year-old sitting on the floor sings ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" moments before the killer emerges, the children's voice samples and bizarre juxtapositions of music boxes and unearthly shrieking terrify much more effectively than they amuse. Despite the novelty, Fantômas occasionally remind us of their esteemed metal pedigree, and, if only in small doses, give a glimpse of their true potential. ""04/02/05 Saturday"" opens with a brief but brilliant math metal riff from Melvins frontman Buzz Osborne, and Dave Lombardo's apocalyptic snare rolls on ""04/10/05 Sunday"" suggest the former Slayer drummer didn't attend church that day. Patton once again twists and distorts his vocals beyond recognition, so much so that on ""04/24/05 Sunday"" he sounds as mechanical as Osborne's shredding metal guitar. Still, too often the question arises of whether Fantômas wants to make musical progress or scare the shit out of you. Since The Director's Cut the band has increasingly lost touch with form and melody in their songwriting. While those elements are hardly essential in producing experimental noise metal, they're preferred over the unfocused, kitschy sampling and sound effects that have replaced them. With today's cartoons darker and more violent than ever, I'm sure cartoon music could someday sound as though influenced by Suspended Animation, but I highly doubt any rock music will.","Ipecac band follows its one-track, 74-minute LP with a record that squeezes 30 songs into less than three-quarters of an hour.

Beauty and the Beat,Edan,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc02c0084474cd0c29b4/1:1/w_160/5a24935f.jpg,2005-04-18 05:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2682-beauty-and-the-beat/,Lewis,"Edan is quite the character: With him, it's either ""Sing it, shitface"" or an exercise in hip-hop erudition, as heard on his Fast Rap mixtape. Which is why one never knows what to expect from his recorded output. His debut LP, Primitive Plus, mixed the retarded with the ingenious; it was an entertaining album in a backpacker era that was more often redundant than refreshing. So, when photos of the newly hirsute Edan emerged and rumors of a ""rock"" record made the rounds, it became easy to imagine a Derek/Biggie Smalls concept album replete with irony and wankery. This record is no joke. Having established himself as a ruthless wit and tireless scholar of rap, Edan makes the leap to ""serious artist"" on Beauty and the Beat, exhibiting an auteurism that places him level with his predecessors instead of prostrate before them. On lead single ""I See Colours"", Edan declares, ""Prince Paul already used this loop/ But I'ma keep it movin'/ And put you up on the scoop."" The lyric is a synopsis of Edan's new outlook. Yes, it's been done before, but not like this. The song is his epiphany over a 60s jangle and mushrooming Moog effects. Like a master mathematician who suddenly sees the pattern in the formula, Edan commences his solution. One more time before he blows your mind, Edan pays respects to the ""true scientists"". ""Fumbling Over Words That Rhyme"" is a timeline of the forgotten founders. True, many of the names he drops are familiar, but-- as many of the mentioned could tell you-- respect is the only restitution to them. Over a runaway break, Edan pays dues to the Fatback Band on up, providing a syllabus for future pupils. The nightmarish diptych of ""Murder Mystery"" and ""Torture Chamber""-- the latter featuring Percee P's lyrical conveyor belt over the churning bass-line from Pink Floyd's ""On the Run""-- bleeds into ""Making Planets"", an organ dirge backing Edan's laidback braggadocio that changes gears into a Crazy Horse-ish Mr. Lif conspiracy theory. Each song transitions to the next through the ever-present Moog noodlings and shared elements, an effort at a hip-hop long-player and not simply a collection of singles. ""Rock and Roll"" applies Black Sabbath, Velvet Underground, and Talking Heads to create a psychedelic ode to its titular genre, and ""Science of the Two"" is a tangled mass of Edan and Insight that rivals Run-DMC for seamless vocal interplay. On the latter half of the album, ""Beauty"", ""Smile"", and ""Promised Land"" are three sample-packed masterpieces that compress the time between '68 and '88. Reversed drum loops, found sounds, droning feedback, Echoplexed vocals, syrupy strings, and truckloads of bubbling Moog intermingle with Edan's Kane-with-a-cold mic skills to astonishing effect. The gravity of Edan's lyrics and voice on Beauty and the Beat is perhaps its most surprising element. He's gone from a brainiac prankster to the Borges of rap. Even his battle rhymes have a surrealist bent. He doesn't wear watches by Jacob. He ""wears the Time Meridian as a wristband."" He doesn't grace stages. He ""does the show on a fireball."" He doesn't wear his own clothing line. He ""put a nameplate on a asteroid belt."" Edan satirizes the narcissism of hip-hop by being so out-there narcissistic that someone would basically have to say, ""I'm the best MC times infinity"" to compete. But it's more than just his otherworldly assertions. Nearly every bar is a saturated image of his subconscious put on display to ponder its meaning. Some of it may just be nonsense but most if it is resonant. His lyrical inventiveness and idiosyncratic metaphors place him in a category populated by few. Edan is hip-hop, without a doubt. But he's the hip-hop that appeared in the suburbs in the late-80's and shared time with metal and indie rock, when MTV's weekend line-up was ""Yo!MTVRaps"", ""120 Minutes"", and ""Headbangers Ball"", with Public Enemy likely to find time on all three. Beauty and the Beat sounds like a record made by someone who once devoured the catalog and history of his favorite artists, traced their lineage as far back as he could, and has discovered his place in the genealogy. With that enlightenment, Edan is no longer an impersonation of his idols, but one of their peers. ","Having established himself as a ruthless wit and tireless scholar of rap, Edan makes the leap to ""serious artist"" on Beauty and the Beat, exhibiting an auteurism that places him level with his predecessors instead of prostrate before them.

The ridiculous liner notes and other contextualizations have followed Weird War singer Ian Svenonious since his days in Nation Of Ulysses and the Make-Up, qnd Illuminated by the Light ironically winks so hard it tears up, but this album-- the band's most cohesive to date-- is full of grooves that sincerely want you to dance. This is Weird War at their most minimal and stoned-- hyper-compressed single-note guitar lines that boogie over thick bass and sparse funky drumming, with Svenonious or singer Michelle Mae calling out lewd comments from the fog. Weird War have been deconstructing clichés since their conception by delivering them with maximum smirk, and Illuminated uses them all so you never have to hear them again. ""Girls Like That"" is a disco-shuffling highlight but after four minutes, I never have to hear that ""Staying Alive"" bassline ever again. The story of ""Motorcycle Mongoloid"" unfolds with purposeful, hilarious tedium, and I've since sworn off ""Leader of the Pack""-style narrative songs entirely. But many of these tracks are clever concepts that are dull in execution and often overstay their welcome, like the vocal ad-libbing at the end of ""Crystal Healing"" or the fake-out ending of ""Illuminated"", an otherwise great track with swinging guitar and a well-placed dash of cheap electronic drums. Only ""Earth Mama Woman Girl Child"" lets its hair down, a drum-cricle acoustic strum with Svenonious returning to his Make-Up mode of falsetto hysterics. Weird War's eponymous debut was a sloppy, brilliant mess and a hell of a lot of fun, something that has been fractioning with every subsequent release. If brevity if the soul of wit, then part of what made Weird War work was the short songs, and last year's If You Can't Beat Em, Bite 'Em had more variety-- not to mention ass-shakers like ""AK-47"".

Their matching jumpsuits and space-age specs are brilliantly meta, not to mention the egregious shoutouts to new wave influences. Polysics or Die!!!, a greatest hits compilation of sorts-- and Polysics's first release since leaving Asian Man Records-- sports titles like ""New Wave Jacket"", ""Eno"", the not-so-veiled ""XCT"", and a cover of ""My Sharona"". However, the Polysics' obsession with a certain Akron, Ohio five-piece permeates this collection. Not only do they boast the craziest synth, surf guitar, robo-beat and spastic vocals combo since Freedom of Choice, but everything's accelerated for current listeners' frenetic, DDR-paced attention spans. California-based Tofu, a label specializing in exposing unsung Japanese acts to the States, picks up on this connection and by re-recording five of Polysics' best songs for the album, they make a concerted attempt to pique the Nintendo demographic. Usually these re-recordings simply improve the lo-fi Asian Man takes, but the difference is considerable. The matador-inspired chromatic chords of ""Buggie Techinica"" get the arena treatment, sounding even larger and more grandiose than the Hey! Bob! My Friend! version. ""Hot Stuff"" also benefits by harder rocking production, its chunky bassline and yelping vocals no longer sounding as though recorded from a boom box. At the time of their release, each Polysics album has appeared to be ""the big one,"" the record that endears Americans to these goofy homages to new wave nerd rock. Unfortunately, Hey! Bob! My Friend! and Neu, both adored by critics, have barely registered in even the most open-minded indie rock circles, and there's little reason to think this compilation will buck that trend. Perhaps the video game beeps and glitches seem too tacky, or the sugary Japanese vocals too kiddy, or the audacious album title too cocksure compared to today's modest, pretend-like-you-don't-give-a-fuck bands, but this band actually deserves those three exclamation points.","Japanese new wave fans release a mix of catalog songs and new recordings.

They just happen to like wearing leather jackets and having their gaunt faces photographed in elevators. Their idea to combine new wave, garage rock, and dance music just popped into their head, because, hey, what if rock bands started doing that? The Bravery aren't fooling anybody: They fit the post-new wave blueprint so immaculately, they're one power chord away from securing a gig at the 2005 VMA's between their rivals the Killers and Razorlight. So here come the Bravery-- hi-hats, synthesizers, mop-tops, ennui, and all. The Bravery try to resuscitate worn-out 80s pop progressions with squeaky-clean production, wrapping their chord changes with layers of synthesizer and power-pop guitar until something sounds interesting. The results are forgivable but disappointing nonetheless. ""Swollen Summer"" sorely lacks a jaw-dropping melody to complement its Go-Go's power chords. Other tracks can't quite get their basslines off the ground, partially due to frontman Sam Endicott's inability to go anywhere with the song's one melodic hook. Endicott is perhaps the most egregious new wave conglomerate around. Shifting through imitations of Robert Smith, Simon Le Bon, and Julian Casablancas, Endicott exercises little subtlety when borrowing from his influences. He reaches into the somber bowels of Disintegration for the haunting vocals on ""No Brakes"", yet apes Casablancas's sanguine croon on ""The Ring Song"". Resembling other singers isn't a dealbreaker, but when this likeness occurs multiple times across the course of an album-- and with such disparate singing styles-- it raises a red flag. Throw in a propensity for self-deprecation, and Endicott is a walking Cliff's Notes for new wave revivalists; on ""Out of Line"" he's ""a liar, but not a cheat,"" on ""Unconditional"", a ""beggar, and...a chooser,"" and on ""Tyrant"" he's ""stuck just like a pig"". The titles alone beat his whole ""helpless subjection"" bit to death. Occasionally, these squirrels do stumble across a nut. The chorus of ""An Honest Mistake"" contains one of the few sassy moments on the album, with Endicott mockingly singing in falsetto ""Don't look at me that way/ It was an honest mistake."" Also, when you pour three synthesizers into each song, you're bound to find a cool hook, like the one in the verse of ""Tyrant"". Despite these highlights, though, this is still rock made on an assembly line-- predictable, economically efficient, and about as dynamic as a Model T.","Hi-hats, synthesizers, mop-tops, ennui, self-deprecating lyrics, Robert Smith-like vocals-- this is practically a Cliff's Notes for the new wave revival.

Yep, it's a concept record-- sort of. Johnson's imagery is circumspect and oblique, his lyrics often indecipherably garbled, as if he were backing off from the concept even as he committed it to tape. It'll only be apparent to listeners who've read reviews that harp on it, and once you know, it's tough to give the record a fair shake: The somber seriousness of the music is hard to reconcile with the absurdity of [CONCEPT EXPURGATED]. But these good intentions are already gut-shot and staggering; now you're direly curious: What could it be about? The square dude from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air? Nah, way off. And my fingers are hovering over the three keys that would irrevocably reveal it all, as reality limps in on silent paws (hint hint): Beyond the imperceptible concept and some perfumed adjectives regarding beauty and ethereality, there isn't much to say about The Carlton Chronicles. It is beautiful, that's certain: Check out ""Charred Resentment the Same"", with its two movements of lazing guitars and double-tracked vocals (one high and clear, the other low and husky, recalling Iron and Wine's technique on ""Upward Over the Mountains"") bridged by a dual-guitar conversation and a distantly shimmering organ. Or ""Predatory King Today"", with its melancholic M. Ward-ish warble, gently accumulating arpeggios, and perfectly positioned slide guitar accents. Shuffle these descriptions through various permutations to attain a sense of the album on the main, or imagine Sufjan Stevens ghostwriting for Neil Young. But here's the crux: Do you like golf-course beauty, the unbroken idyll with everything in its right place? Or flowers-in-the-wreckage beauty, flawed and exotic, becoming beautiful in its deviation from the ideal? Fans of the former will enjoy the procession of homecoming queens, winsome but somehow artificial, that comprises The Carlton Chronicles, but fans of the latter might feel they've depleted its charms after a couple spins and begin pining for the cute punk girl with the overlarge eyes and obnoxious laugh.

As the epigraph for his 1910 novel, Howards End, these words described urban-- ""creeping London""-- intersecting with rural, heart coming into harmony with mind. Warmer Corners is an album of and about such connections, where they meet, how they fall apart, and how they become art. Known for supple wordplay, on this outing guitarist and primary songwriter Marty Donald opens up his diction and closes his rhyming dictionary. Don't worry, he's still flush with inspired lines like ""you kept your distance and me guessing, finally acquiescing"" on ""Great Lengths"", about a girl playing hard to get who gets hardily gotten. But ""The Music Next Door"" merely rhymes ""door"" with ""more"" with ""a song I've heard a hundred times before,"" which all makes sense even if you miss the subtle wink. Then there's its Chekhovian storyline and its ambiguous non-resolution. You'll get it, O.C. kids will think they get it, and everybody's happy until concert tickets sell out. Look, over there, isn't that Ben Gibbard? [yoink] Ahem. Warmer Corners also broadens the emotional base of its predecessor, 2003's excellent and underrated Naturaliste. That album allowed the regret that had simmered stoically since at least as early as 1999's Staring at the Sky to reach full boil. ""How did they come to this?"" vocalist/drummer Tali White wondered dolefully. The same sorrow clouds Warmer Corners, but beneath exultant arrangements propelled by guest Lucksmith Louis Richter's Rubber Soul guitar leads along with horns, strings, organ, and pedal steel. The happy-music-with-sad-lyrics shtick has been done often, but rarely so well since the Lucksmiths' namesakes. White's ""Sunlight in a Jar"" provides a shy respite of sheer joy. Though most previous Lucksmiths songs loll charmingly within the Aussie countryside, 1997 throwaway ""Wyoming"" excepted, Warmer Corners acknowledges the band's extensive U.S. touring. Lead single ""The Chapter in Your Life Entitled San Francisco"" neatly juxtaposes both locales, with winter rolling out in Fog City as summer slowly passes Down Under. The song's soaring choruses and downcast gaze thrill me even more than when I first reviewed them. On the winningly meta ""Fiction"", White sings longingly of ""a girl from Kansas City"" in his usual rich, Morrissey-esque phrasing. Other songs take place unmistakably in Australia or bassist Mark Monnone's new home of Tasmania. The Lucksmiths never relinquish their distinctive identity, merely expand it.","Unjustly overlooked band issues another set of smart, hummable indie pop songs.

Akron/Family,Akron/Family,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bdc0084474cd0bfe9f/1:1/w_160/7ce36265.jpg,2005-04-17 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/473-akronfamily/,Young God,"As long as people believe poverty and authenticity go hand-in-hand, lo-fi will never go out of style. Demand for the holey cardigan stylings of artists like Phil Elvrum, Lou Barlow, and Emperor X seems to peak every couple years, and after last year's freak(folk)-out, you might expect a brief recession, followed by the reemergence of a hermetic lo-fi denizen like Elvrum with his strangest sonic odyssey yet. But Akron/Family jump the gun with their new self-titled debut LP, drawing on lo-fi's aesthetic tenets while broadening its instrumental scope. Lo-fi, yes, but Akron/Family are working with way more than a four-track here: Loads of swampy found-sound texturing belies the complexity of their arrangements. Close-mic'ing and muffled vocals are standard fare, but don't disregard the triple-tracked guitars, string sections, and frequent choral accompaniment. The album varies tonally without swinging wildly, and the instrumentation-- while often dense and effects-laden-- is consistent at its core. Ringleaders include guitar, banjo, bass, and vocals (lots of it). This makes for an easy listen; even at 14 tracks and a shade over an hour long, the album seldom drags. But it's just as easy to extrapolate singularly catchy tracks as it is to digest the album in its totality. Opener ""Before and Again"" condenses the band's selling points into a multifarious folk farrago, replete with bucolic acoustic plucks, string swells, chirruping synths, and ambient sounds. Despite the boundlessness of their instrumentation, Akron/Family maintain remarkable warmth (o, that stock descriptor of lo-fi ingenuity!), playing at restrained volumes that invite close listening. Occasionally they bust out with some noize, like the mushrooming electric gee-tar solo on ""Suchness"", but any departure from the band's typical whisper feels like a wail. Half of the album's sonic density comes from white noise, but unlike, say, The Glow, pt. II, it's used for layering, never as a stopgap between songs. Eight-minute plodder ""Italy"" issues a steady stream of waking yawns as it squirms to life. The song's lethargic pace may lead some to hit the snooze button, but wait it out: When the voice declares, ""I'm ready,"" it's no joke. Guitars and drums erupt out of their lassitude and hack away at the beat until it no longer exists, while a trumpet brings some melodic semblance to it all. Try as the band might to weirdify the album, the melodies are irrepressible. Certain songs reveal a jones for back porch folk. ""I'll Be on the Water"" is the tread back to shore after a long wet day, happily sunburned. At first uncomfortably pensive, the song grows more comfortable in its bittersweet, lovelorn pose, blossoming from a scratchy murmur into a bonfire jamboree. ""Afford"" is similarly pastoral: notice the bird chirps amid nylon strings spiraling listlessly in the humid mix. Every family needs a father, and Akron have Angels of Light frontman Michael Gira, whose production draws on the restless, emotive aspects of the band's sound and embraces their sprawl. Frustrating for their imperfections, charming for their listlessness, and irresistible for their melodies, Akron/Family are likable for all the wrong reasons. The album is easy to criticize, yet Akron/Family couldn't/shouldn't have done anything differently. When a band keep you as close and captive as Akron/Family, dwelling on the shortcomings would be depriving yourself of a compelling, emotionally complex experience.","Rich, complex lo-fi from Michael Gira's Young God label.

Juggernaut Rides,Swervedriver,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60ab1335d7bf1698d36/1:1/w_160/f5036de2.jpg,2005-04-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7667-juggernaut-rides/,Castle,"It's sadly appropriate that the title for this two-disc retrospective comes from a B-side. The sadness comes from a case of the woulda-coulda-shouldas, wherein this group, in that ""other world"" music writers and fans like to talk about, would be the top of the pops from Timbuktu to Kalamazoo. Instead, Swervedriver was beset by the sorts of calamities and mishaps that turn a would-be world-beater into an asterisk. For instance, the drummer leaving for a sandwich during a North American tour stop the way dead-beat dads go out for cigarettes. Also, the group getting dropped from a label one week after said label releases the newest record. In addition, the group getting signed to a multi-national major label right before the corporation decides to do a little downsizing, which includes the band. And, of course, the most damning strike of all: making idiosyncratic music that folks try to describe and market with one-word descriptors. I'd prefer to defer to the term main songwriter and guitarist Adam Franklin coined when talking about Swervedriver-- ""space travel rock'n'roll"". The group's first album, Raise, shared enough sonic and textural similarities with their Creation Records contemporaries that the ""shoegazer"" label Swervedriver received wasn't woefully inappropriate. While most bands of that ilk were looking down at their feet due to shyness and/or boredom, Swervedriver looked down to make sure they were hitting the right guitar pedal before letting fly with a guitar solo. No doubt Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge learned how to stare at their Chuck Taylors by watching J Mascis. Juggernaut Rides starts and ends with versions of the group's first single, ""Son of Mustang Ford""-- Disc 1 features the official single, while Disc 2 concludes with a previously unreleased demo of the track. It's a decent enough song, but the horse I'll put my money on is ""Rave Down"", a track that makes the seemingly awful notion of ""shimmering grunge"" sound brilliant. And then the drummer got hungry, and the bassist left in a more traditional fashion, so Franklin and Hartridge found themselves a new drummer (Keith Moon wannabe Jez) and, as a trio, recorded Mezcal Head, the pinnacle of the group's short career. If you don't believe me, believe the track listing-- out of the 33 tracks included on these two discs, 11 were either on the record, released as B-sides to its singles, or featured on its promos. This includes six actual album tracks, if you count ""Never Lose That Feeling"", a UK single added as a bonus for the U.S. version of the album, and ""93 Million Miles From The Sun And Counting"", a slower (and lesser) rerecording of an album track, ""Maggie & Harry"". Mezcal Head found the group synthesizing their touchstones and discovering a sound that was both panoramic and spartan, as well as fine-tuning a lyrical voice already enamored with pulp fiction trappings like fast cars and fast death and (thanks to Quentin Tarantino) surf guitar. Unfortunately, the folks compiling this set went with the single-length versions of most of these tracks, and not the superior expansive album-length versions-- hence, instead of the 11-minute workout from the U.S. pressing of the album, there's the abrupt fade-out at the end of ""Never Lose That Feeling"" after a measley four minutes. The highlight of this bunch is ""Last Train to Satansville"", a story about a guy, a girl, a gun, and a passenger on a train underpinned by a terse locomotive rhythm. Franklin's laconic smoky croon is the perfect vehicle for this tale, an imaginary collaboration between Alfred Hitchcock and Martin Scorsese. Ejector Seat Reservation, the group's 3rd album, came to be during the rise of Oasis and Cool Britannia. Where the pop sensibilities of the Brothers Gallagher involved little more than sincerely flattering the Beatles, Swervedriver went full-on pop, quoting everything from Bob Dylan to Burt Bacharach (on ""How Does It Feel To Look Like Candy""), offering choruses of ""ba ba ba"" and ""la la la"", and tossing out hooks like eight-armed fishermen (good luck getting ""The Other Jesus"" out of your head). It's a loopy, silly, fantastic record, the sort of album that critics love (hi there), cash registers shun, and record labels avoid-- Ejector Seat Reservation was never released in the U.S., though used bin divers can probably find A&M; promos for this disc in the usual places. Their final album, 99th Dream, served as a fitting summation of where the group had been-- the title track brings the hooks and the ""Misirlou"" homage, while ""Behind The Scenes of the Sounds and the Times"" brings the widescreen vistas and the long song titles. And that's where it ends. So now, seven years later, there's this compilation, with rarities and unreleased tracks rubbing elbows with songs that were featured in NME as both Single of the Week and Single of Next Week. For newcomers, navigating Juggernaut Rides might seem daunting, but it's conveniently organized so that most of the choice cuts are included on Disc One. Not to say that Disc Two isn't worth a listen-- ""Duress"" and the unreleased ""Neon Lights Glow"" (with a respectful nod to Link Wray) is definitely worth checking out-- but it's somewhat superfluous in light of what the first disc has to offer. For fans, this collection is a loving and generous mash note, even if they probably already own most of the tracks on here. For the group being honored here, Juggernaut Rides is a fitting tribute, putting a fantastic set of neglected songs back into print. This is Swervedriver's beautiful corpse. It's a wonder to behold.","Two-disc, 33-track compilation anthologizes this sadly overlooked UK group.

Press the Space Bar,Chicks on Speed,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b69d034d5c69bf3368/1:1/w_160/e8089f73.jpg,2005-04-17 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1443-press-the-space-bar/,Chicks on Speed,"""History will outlive us!/ History will forgive us!/ History will forget us!,"" one Chick shouts in the middle of a sadomasochistic session, as if choking on the meaninglessness of all the sexual politics about the roles of domination/submission. ""They call you a bitch/ You become a sales pitch!"" some bloke chimes in. Those moments planted in ""History Will Outlive Us"", a surf-rock romp set to a broken-knuckled electro thud, are the most poignant on Press the Space Bar, a mess of an album by Chicks on Speed and their Spanish collaborators, the No Heads. Post-techno celebrity Cristian Vogel of Super_Collider manned the production that, oddly for him, seems to be recorded in a metal shop. The Chicks-- Kiki Moorse, Melissa Logan and Alex-Murray Leslie-- are still typecast as ""art-school punks,"" even though they gave up college long ago. The stigma is fair\xD0 making a career from an avant-garde statement about Information Age decadence in the form of Reagan-era trash, ""Do-It-Yourself"" synth-pop, and tacky clothing...well, it's tough to break away from one's public image when that's what you've built your music around. Being embalmed in an Electroclash\xAA specimen jar does not help either, but to the Chicks' credit, they largely depart from the discount-shop techno for a ramshackle noise-rock band. Opener ""The Household Song,"" is an old-fashioned, feminist shooting gallery jaunt. On a skiffle groove, the Chicks wag their fingers at the homemakers' life, singing about the pleasures of cooking, dusting, and breeding with quotation marks spray-painted over it all. ""They say emancipation/ 'Go out and work'/ But I just want to stay home and do my housework!"" they deadpan. The tune is a quaint romp, given that we now live in a time when homemaking is an economic luxury. The following ""Mitte Bitte"" keeps the momentum with a gritty roadhouse-punk guitar riff and vocals switch-bladed in German. But then ""Class War"" arrives and the album loses its fingers, toes, limbs, and then its head. The Chicks and the band want to declare a revolt against the bourgeois, while lollygagging in front of the television. The smeared din of broadcasted news clutter the recording as the band fiddles with a vague blues, and a Chick reads Chomsky-lite descriptions of how the crooked politicians are screwing Us over. They then break into a hardcore call-to-arms that pales to Fear's trashier and more visceral hardcore punk oldie, ""Let's Have a War"". The first part of ""Culture Vulture"" is an amusing for its sloppy tape manipulation and cartoonish basslines as the Chicks decry attention deficit disorder as our consumer society's disease. But elsewhere, the album is marred by malfunctioned, art-noise experiments with un-oiled buzzsaw guitars, CB-radio broadcasts of spoken-word pieces, and digital clutter. The most successful lab results are ""Madelyn Albrights Answer"", with its engrossing house groove and coal-smoked synth drones, and the cascading, bowed drones that barely forgive the poetry of ""My Pony"". There, the pretension is so rich. One Chick deadpans, ""When you're hungry, you eat/ When you're tired, you go to sleep."" She repeats the mantra so many times and with so little sincerity that there is a moment where she utters, ""uh"" before pushing herself to say those damned words.","The electroclash holdovers team here with Spain's the No Heads.

Trade Test Tramsmissions,Buzzcocks,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a413ea9e61561daa4e04/1:1/w_160/86053437.gif,2005-04-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1052-trade-test-tramsmissions/,CarolineCaroline,"The Buzzcocks aren't always the first or second name on the tip of the tongue when discussing the progenitors of punk, but it didn't take long for Singles Going Steady to become one of the seminal documents of the genre's first wave upon its release in 1979: The collection proves them among the finest singles bands of their day. While news of their reunion in 1989 had critics and old crusties on the edge of their seats, the general public wasn't quick to respond with similar adulation-- they were easily overshadowed by the rise of disciples Green Day, the dubious return of the Sex Pistols, and the corporatized copyists that would send punk tunneling back underground. Of course, the Buzzcocks, in its current incarnation, continues to release solid albums and tour every few years, regardless of critical or public opinion, and if few fans were clamoring for it to see wider re-release, perhaps their first reunion LP, 1993's Trade Test Transmissions, will gain more attention in retrospect. Songwriters Pete Shelley and Steve Diggle had been recording experimental music in their time away from the Buzzcocks, but TTT was a return to the overdriven chords and campy melodies of their best-loved work. TTT does show Shelley and Diggle (a new rhythm section was in place by the time of recording) nearly as capable as performers as they were in their heyday, but it doesn't show much more than that. By no means is it a bad album: Tight tracks like ""Do It"" and ""TTT"" balance melody and bite. But Diggle gets much more time in front of the microphone here than before-- notably on ""Isolation"", with strong vocals and one of TTT's best melodies-- but Shelley always was the superior showman. Songs like those and ""Innocent"" echo some of the kick of the band's older work, and ""Palm of Your Hand"" makes for a particularly spirited retread (the best topics never age). Unfortunately, in playing it loud but safe, Trade Test Transmissions says little more than, ""We're back"": More than a decade on from their peak, the Buzzcocks weren't taking the creative chances of songs like ""Why Can't I Touch It?"", nor packing the wallop of early triumphs like ""Orgasm Addict"", ""What Do I Get"", ""Ever Fallen in Love"", or any of the countless others. This reissue adds material from the album's accompanying singles as bonus tracks, giving new listeners a glimpse of the Buzzcocks' still-hungry performances at the time. Along with Shelley's ""All Over You"" (available on the earlier American release), new inclusions like ""Trash Away"" prove their live chops, and hard-rockers ""Libertine Angel"" and ""Roll It Over"" add a dash of keyboards and loads more guitars, with hooks that improve on most of the original album. In that respect, this edition deserves credit for further documenting the band's sincerity and veracious performances after years outside the limelight. Still, the album remains a strictly diehards-only affair.","Sanctuary reissues the 1993 reunion LP from the punk greats.

Music for Films / Apollo / Thursday Afternoon / More Music for Films,Brian Eno,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0869d034d5c69bf2738/1:1/w_160/a6a94e7b.gif,2005-04-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11732-music-for-films-apollo-thursday-afternoon-more-music-for-films/,Astralwerks,"A spiritual big brother to theory-sopped music bloggers everywhere, the left-brained Brian Eno has always had a love affair with parameters. As the story goes, when Microsoft asked him to compose the Windows startup sound in the early 90s, they supplied a broadsheet of adjectives requesting the piece embody the phrases ""universal,"" ""optimistic,"" ""emotional,"" and ""futuristic,"" among others. The task of mediating those descriptors would be a lot to ask of any composition, never mind one that couldn't exceed 3.25 seconds in length. But to Eno, who happened to be stuck in a particularly barren creative rut, Microsoft's challenge looked a lot like a life preserver. By subsequently creating more than 75 pieces of music that fit the description (one of which was the familiar open-ended bell chime that probably sits somewhere between ""Happy Birthday"" and any number of Coke jingles on the master list of North America's most frequently heard pieces of music), Eno managed to shake himself out of a tree; not soon after, he was back to composing original material with his usual prolificacy. But it's the rare puzzle solver who naturally gravitates to hazy, formless spaces, and Eno fits that description as well. Arguably as interested in the mysteries of methodology as he is in music, he's never been one to deny ambiguity's role in the creative process. Few composers have trusted music's nowhere qualities as fully as Eno-- that he's managed to maintain a logician's interrogative, purposeful edge while maintaining an output of sounds so enveloping they hang like a fog is one of his most interesting accomplishments. Released under the Soundtracks container, these beautifully packaged reissues mark the third batch of Eno remasters from Astralwerks. Where the four discs released under the Early Works banner focused on Eno's vocal-driven compositions and those in Ambient Works on his most clearly defined ambient pieces, the thread tying these four 'soundtracks' together is more tenuous. Two of them (1978's Music for Films and the new compilation More Music From Films) include significant portions of music that were only ever conceived (but not used) as film soundtracks; 1985's Thursday Afternoon may have comprised the backing to one of Eno's video art installations, but it's built in the mirror image of his more famous ambient compositions, and has little in common with traditional soundtrack work. So really, instead of lumping them together as soundtracks, it's probably more accurate to say these discs represent the point in the excavation where Eno's work starts to get a little trans-concept and certainly more difficult to classify. Containing music for films that never existed and music for existing places that, as far as the earthbound among us are concerned, might as well not, this is the sound of Eno playing with parameter and ambiguity's relationship to one another. Music for Films is a collection of sparse, moody setpieces whose connections to actual films vary widely. Although more active and more heavily orchestrated than Eno's ambient compositions, its 18 tracks waft in and out in similarly unceremonious fashion. Some, such as ""Inland Sea"" and the ""Sparrowful"" trilogy, recall the fat-bodied analog keyboards of Discreet Music; others, like the percussive drone-piece ""M386"", counteract the melodic lulls with hammering nervous tension. Featuring songs recorded in different time periods with different musicians (Robert Fripp, John Cale, and a young Phil Collins are among the many who turn up here), it runs a little unevenly in spots, but it's nonetheless as evocative as anything Eno's ever done. My favorite of these four reissues, 1983's Apollo-Atmospheres & Soundtracks is the only full-fledged film soundtrack of the lot. Co-written with brother Roger and Daniel Lanois (who provides radiant guitar work on tracks like ""Silver Morning"" and ""Deep Blue Day"") as the score to Al Reinert's documentary on the Apollo lunar landings, it represents Eno's attempt to slightly redress the popular media's glib and histrionic television presentation of the event. At times empty and disconnected (""Matta""), weightless and serene (""Drift"") and completely beautiful (""An Ending (Ascent)""), it adheres to an internal logic that culminates with the suitably skin-crawling ""Stars"". Featuring a single, mostly static track that hovers unchanged for the bulk of its 61 minutes, Thursday Afternoon is probably the best example of what Eno famously called a holographic work. Just as a small piece of a holograph contains the information of that holograph in its entirety, any small portion of this track also contains its essence as a whole. With its ambient drones and gently suspended piano notes, Thursday Afternoon unfurls like a blanket, and along with Music for Airports, remains one of Eno's most mystifying and durable works, a thing you could stare into forever without ever seeing through. Finally, More Music For Films marks the first of Astralwerks' twelve reissues to potentially hold something new for existing Eno fans. Consisting of tracks taken from the rare, vinyl-only compilations Music for Films Directors' Edition and Music for Films Volume 2, it represents the first time that about half of these songs have ever been released on CD. As you might expect from a collection of lesser heard odds and sods, it's easily the most disjointed and sprawling disc of the bunch, but there are enough rewards and curiosities there to reward the diehards. Be warned though: due to a manufacturing error, many of the discs contain the music for ""Approaching Taidu"" as tracks 18 and 20, thus shortchanging the buyer of the scheduled track 18, ""Climate Study"". Astralwerks are currently working on a replacement version, so caveat emptor and all that. Fans who've had the opportunity to A/B any of the old CD pressings to the first eight reissues in this series already know how good the remastering job is, but it bears repeating one last time. Not only are the small details now significantly more vivid, but the overall levels have been adjusted as well. To me, these feel definitive, the pressings that these records have always deserved, and it's nice to be able to hear them for the first time again. ","Latest batch of reissues from Brian Eno includes three records from the late 1970s and early 80s and adds a new collection.

Black Sheep Boy,Okkervil River,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b1ea9e61561daa7043/1:1/w_160/dee9e08f.jpg,2005-04-14 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5963-black-sheep-boy/,Jagjaguwar,"Will Sheff sounds mad. Not angry mad, but the other mad-- nearly hysterical. On Okkervil River's fourth album, Black Sheep Boy, he oversings beyond the limits of taste and vocal cords, either belting the notes forcefully or overenunciating his syllables at quieter moments. You can even hear his agitated spittle hitting the microphone on ""For Real"". It's as if his voice is too small a vessel for the big ideas and even bigger emotions that drive the band. As Pauline Kael once wrote of Gene Wilder, Sheff ""taps a private madness,"" as if the pain and heartbreak around him-- the runaway sons, abused daughters, lost friends, damaged lovers, and doomed relationships that comprise the world of the album-- push him to caterwauling arias, his hysteria barely bottled by the demands of his carefully constructed songs. But, like Wilder, Sheff never overplays his hand and always maintains control, which, also like Wilder, makes him at once heartbreaking and somewhat humorous-- more self-aware than Conor Oberst, more serious than Colin Meloy, more legible than Jeff Mangum. Black Sheep Boy creates a roomy and natural showcase for Sheff's high-wire vocals, and as a result, it may be the band's best album, the crest of a wave that began with 2003's Down the River of Golden Dreams and rose through a subsequent EP and two releases by sister band Shearwater. Okkervil River's major accomplishment-- what sets Black Sheep Boy farthest apart from previous efforts-- is the sense of purpose to these songs: they sound studiously literate, melodic, and concise, which bolsters their cumulative effect. A concept album that moves thematically rather than narratively, Black Sheep Boy was inspired by the Tim Hardin song of the same name and begins with a more or less faithful cover. The following 10 songs expound on these themes of prodigality and wanderlust as the band display an unflinching devotion to the sheepish title metaphor, following it all the way through until the boy becomes a ram. Writing in first-person, Sheff traffics not in plots, but in predicaments full of concrete details and clever wordplay. On ""Black"", a man despairs to counsel and comfort his lover, who was abducted and possibly abused as a child. ""April 12th, with nobody else around; you were outside the house...when he put you in the car,"" Sheff sings, capturing the character's boiling frustration and romantic abandon. Meanwhile, the band churns a bouncy pop energy, driven by Jonathan Meiburg's keyboards and Zachary Thomas's rubber-ball bass, which pushes and prods him along, intensifying the emotions even as it seems at tonal odds with the dark material. But, as the music makes clear, ""Black"" is a love song, a statement of determined devotion. The sound on Black Sheep Boy, while certainly familiar to fans, is so far removed from the purposefully lulling pace of Golden Dreams that it could belong to another band altogether. To an extent, it does: The quartet has grown into a sextet, and the expanded line-up is evident in the ambitious, intricate, yet accessible arrangements and the dramatic dynamic between the songs. ""For Real"", ""Black"", and ""The Latest Toughs"" are frenzied headlong rushes that nicely offset the quieter moments like ""A King and a Queen"" and ""In a Radio Song"". ""A Stone"" rests on a bare honky-tonk two-step shuffle, and Howard Draper's lap steel adds a flourish to ""Get Big"", a duet with Amy Annelle. Careening strings and crescendoing horns add catharsis to the eight-minute ""So Come Back, I Am Waiting"", the album's climax. ""A Glow"", though, is its dark denouement, a menacing coda to Okkervil River's most sustained and startling collection of songs yet, throughout which the band makes Sheff's private madness starkly public.","Okkervil's newest batch of songs create a roomy and natural showcase for Will Sheff's high-wire vocals.

Horses in the Sky,Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40cea9e61561daa4df2/1:1/w_160/14ec7822.gif,2005-04-14 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7168-horses-in-the-sky/,Constellation,"These are dispiriting times for political progressives in North America, but on much of Horses in the Sky, Efrim Menuck and his ragtag troupe of patriots sound uncommonly pissy and defeated. The fourth album created under the various Mt. Zion banners, Horses finds the group expanding upon their established crescendo-laden orchestral formulae in a heady, almost reckless fashion, as though they're determined to rally themselves from sociopolitical despondency through sheer force of musical will. As with Mt. Zion's 2003 release Thee Rusted Satellites Gather + Sing, this album is weighted heavily with Menuck's quavering, strident vocals; a fact some listeners might reasonably regard as an obstacle. Thankfully, however, his bandmates frequently come to his aid both instrumentally and vocally, with some of these tracks eventually morphing into genuine old-fashioned polyphonic Sunday-school rounds. (In fact, one could probably make the argument that Efrim is perhaps this outfit's least naturally gifted vocalist.) Though the group's song lengths remain epic, most of the tracks here are forged as multi-beaded chains, with each divided episodically into shorter, distinctive fragments. This approach pays immediate dividends on ""God Bless Our Dead Marines"", which opens the album with Efrim forlornly singing, ""We put angels in the electric chair"" over a slow, folkish pulse. Soon, however, the full collective kicks into a frenzied, Eastern European-flavored gypsy stomp which sounds like it could be an outtake from Tom Waits' The Black Rider, the group's string section playing as true fiddlers rather than violinists for perhaps the first time in memory. The track continues with Efrim angrily cursing ""vulgar kings on their dirty thrones"" before segueing into a new, resolute piano-led melody and then to a heartbreakingly lovely coda, which eventually swells to include the whole ensemble singing, ""When the world is sick/ Can no one be well/ But I dreamt we were all beautiful and strong."" As powerful as this conclusion is, however, its effect seems to be that of whistling past the graveyard, particularly as the album journeys on through its catalog of grim societal realities. The instrumentation is pared down to a solitary acoustic guitar on the album's title-track, a straightforward, Phil Ochs-like protest song (""Our schools look like prisons/ And our prisons look like malls"") while ""Hang On To Each Other"" features the audible crackle of a roaring campfire, while Efrim and all sing ""Hang on to each other and every fucking thing you love"" with a desperate urgency, as though never expecting to see each other again once the embers burn away. Despite the strengths of these tracks, in other spots the album's lyrics devolve out of sheer ineffectual frustration, as on the extended anti-government rant ""Teddy Roosevelt's Guns"". With its annoyingly repetitive chorus ""O Canada, I've never been your son,"" the group provides a litany of complaints which grows increasingly tiresome as it turns to such silly taunts as ""your senators are in diapers or stinking of gin."" (Although maybe I'm just getting overly defensive since I've been known to enjoy the occasional bottle of gin myself.) ""Ring Them Bells (Freedom Has Come and Gone)"" brings Horses in the Sky to a close with what is the album's most familiar-sounding orchestral slow-build, and though perhaps by now such maneuvers should seem rote for anyone in the extended GYBE family, the track is a reminder of how effective this method can still be when executed with such fervent emotion and exacting precision, with the music's soaring uplift able to briefly assuage the listener's fears of the grim future continually depicted in the group's lyrics.","Latest record from this name-changing Constellation collective.

Shakey,Pit Er Pat,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19313d197565213867a/1:1/w_160/588d6903.jpg,2005-04-14 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6569-shakey/,Thrill Jockey,"Chicago three-piece Pit er Pat began as a backing group for a now-departed singer, and when they first lit out on their own they began by writing instrumentals. The band's 2004 EP Emergency found them experimenting with vocals for the first time. Their debut LP, Shakey, solidifies Pit er Pat as a song-oriented unit, with vocals from keyboardist Fay Davis-Jeffers and drummer Butchy ""Dell"" Fuego. (Just kidding about the Dell, but Butchy Fuego is still a pretty interesting name.) Pit er Pat are a keyboard/bass/drums trio, but their sound is unusual, with Davis-Jeffers' electric piano lines loping merrily above busy and constantly changing beats from Fuego and bassist Rob Doran. Some of the rhythm work is reminiscent of the Sea & Cake's jazzier moments, but the songs belong to a different tradition, incorporating elements of Eastern European folk songs, cabaret, and vaguely progressive rock. It's a hurdy-gurdy sound with heavy instrumental chops, nimbly moving through the tunes' mini-sections with accompanying shifts tempo and meter. Bassist Doran has the sort of flat and untrained indie male voice that, while working decently with the songs, is hard to get excited about. But Davis-Jeffers' airy singing, while no more technically accomplished, sounds relaxed and natural, popping out from the complicated instrumental background. Her tracks are the easy standouts. ""Scared Sorry"" it a twitchy uptempo rumba as Davis-Jeffers cranks up a quasi-Quasi Rocksichord keyboard distortion and tells a tale of a descent into madness (""I'm sorry Wendy, we didn't know how to help you/ I hope that the things you see are beautiful and make you laugh"") from a chilly remove. ""Cake Peg"" is a fractured take on carnival music with lyrics-- something about a royal dance performance atop a desert confection-- that sound nicked from a Calvino short. Shakey is an odd record and each listen feels virgin, as the band's riffs and melodic flourishes drift past without sticking. At its best the album is agreeably hard to peg, a quirky amalgamation of styles that sounds like little else. But the between-the-cracks nature of the record can work against it, as it remains, even after a half-dozen spins, remarkably resistant to absorption.","Debut LP from this Thrill Jockey trio.

Yellow Pills,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83f13d19756521395e3/1:1/w_160/54fcf452.gif,2005-04-14 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2077-yellow-pills/,Numero Group,"The last thing in the world I want is to be a teenager again. I mean, being an adult is no great shakes or anything, but the desire to relive my formative years is just not there at all-- I already have enough regrets from those years following me around as it is. So why do I keep singing to myself, over and over, ""I wanna beeeeeeee a teen a-gain""? It's running through my head just now, even as I'm listening to another song, this catchy, heavenly falsetto that pines for some sort of idealized salad days it can't get back. I can't even remember the name of the band that played it without a quick glance at the tracklisting, but I can't get it out of my head. That's not to say I'm trying to, though. I love a good power pop song, and I'm not opposed to carrying it around with me for a while. Turns out it's by this band called the Toms, and if you've heard of them, wellÉcongratulations. You're one of probably less than a hundred or so people who have. The Toms have three songs on Yellow Pills-- the latest offering from Numero Group, one of the smartest upstart reissue labels in this vast pop culture wasteland we call America-- and all three of them are amazing pop orgasms that could have and should have been hits. Hell, what justice is there in the world if none of the songs on this two-disc run of uninterrupted power pop awesomeness ever graced more than a few awkward ears? Fact is, there are 33 non-hits on here, all by bands that never went anywhere in the culture industry, instead settling to the bottoms of dedicated collector hearts and into the backs of dust-lined milk crates full of musty, forgotten vinyl that smells like what I imagine God's own sweat must smell like. The biggest name in Jordan Oakes' well-penned, self-effacing liners is Jon Brion, who was a member of the Bats, a different band from the great New Zealand indie rockers. Oakes lived and breathed the music you hear on these discs for years, publishing the Yellow Pills zine (10 issues) and compiling the Yellow Pills power pop discs (4 volumes) that lend their name to this new set, and the Numero guys dragged him out of ""retirement"" to have a crack at introducing the curious to some of the best, most overlooked stuff from his own collection. That's part of what makes this work so well-- it's not a bunch of ""essentials"" or whatever. It's a guy sharing records that crawled out onto his sleeve along with his heart, digging through his music library and playing his favorites for you. It's a labor of love and it's openly nostalgic, which is fine, because the people who will scoop this up and internalize every note of it (it doesn't take more than a few listens, actually) are likely to be in a nostalgic frame of mind anyway\xD1nostalgic for that certain Beatles/Beach Boys/dB's/Flamin' Groovies/Nick Lowe pure pop perfection that almost no one does these days. The best-known band on here is definitely the Shoes, whose ""Like I Told You"" is awesome and singular. Sure, these guys listened to Big Star and Badfinger and all that, but they had a unique sound of their own, and it's a spangled, jangly sound with tense, dark rhythms and slinky vocal melodies. From there, it's into the depths of power pop obscurity to a dozen or so bands All Music Guide has never even heard of, skinny tie-wearing assortments of talented boys with collective names like Treble Boys, Kids, Tweeds, and the Trend who seemed to have no luck whatsoever with women. They also seemed to have pop confections dripping out of their noses-- Luxury's ""Green Hearts"" is catchy like Marburg, and dig the awesome guitar parts on ""Hello Mr. Jenkins"" by the Finns. They bounce from speaker to speaker with little melodic doodles in the right channel answered by big chords in the left while the band snottily yet humanely calls out some old Archie Bunker type who can't handle black people, women's lib, or homosexuals. Ooh, yes, there's snot on this thing, too. It can't all be silky smooth harmonies and 600-watt guitars. New York's Speedies sound British and they translate a fractured rhythmic sense and evident Buzzcocks influence into spiky pop-art. Their ""You Need Pop,"" produced by Blondie drummer Clem Burke and never before released, is an addictive, pulsating New Wave beast, quite different from its counterparts on this compilation. Elsewhere, Jack Stack a Track's ""Good Time Music"" is an uncanny Beach Boys homage\xD1the high tenor sounds exactly like Brian Wilson circa just before he installed the sandbox in his living room. It boggles the brain to know that none of this music was ever the least bit popular despite being the very contagious epitome of pop. Listen to that synth hook on the Bats' ""Not Easy for Me"", while they sing ""it's not easy for me to be in love with you/ Without you,"" speaking for every miserable pining soul on the planet with melodic effortlessness. Yellow Pills isn't just another compilation of old stuff you've never heard of. It's a guy and his record collection, his passion for curiously unloved music and his generosity in sharing it. It's the story of your life, too, with love and loss and adolescent angst and adult regret and even a song called ""I Need That Record"", which of course is the common cry of everyone who'll dig this. Yellow Pills makes me happy and makes me want to play my guitar and sing nonsense. It makes me want to spin it over and over and it makes me wanna beeeeeeee a teen a-gain. If you love guitar pop, you'll love this.","Chicago's Numero Group unearths two discs worth of lost power pop gems.

A Closed Universe EP,The Merediths,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35469fc7814a47cd605/1:1/w_160/316c7bf3.jpg,2005-04-13 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5644-a-closed-universe-ep/,Debauchery,"There's only one Meredith in the Merediths, and it's not a woman. It's Joe Meredith, and I've no idea why his surname became the source of the band's moniker-- I guess it works better than the Lucases or the Bryants, a few of the other options open to them. Anyway, there are five Merediths, and their debut EP positions them at an indie-geographical middle point between Athens, Ga., and Bloomington, Ind. The part of their sound that leans toward Athens is evidently borne of some not-insignificant time spent with Olivia Tremor Control on the hi-fi, whilst the Bloomington end of things is the part that leans toward economical restraint and a tendency to rock more straight than out. Bloomington's Impossible Shapes aren't a bad reference point, though I think the Merediths have a bit more natural melodic grace. These five songs cover a neat range of harmony-moistened pop-psych, and it's immediately clear that they're best off when they inhabit a mid-tempo world full of vocal counterpoint that resorts to distortion only as an accent. I say this because the rawest track, ""Cruel Kind of Love"", is also the least successful, perhaps because the lead vocalist (they avoid informing you of which one this is in the liners, though I suspect it's that Meredith character) has to yell over the racket, and it's not his most flattering delivery. He does sound plenty lovely when his mates are backing him up on the mic. ""Let's All Live Underground"" even lays off the mellotron and casual drumming for a big a cappella go at the chorus, with the band all stacked on top of each other like something from a tamer Black Foliage. Opener ""Marmalade Maggie"" has a nice little trick at the 1:30-ish mark where the clean-toned guitars back out in favor of a ""Strawberry Fields"" mellotron bit, and when it feels like they're about to toss every instrument they can find into the fray, they actually pull back instead, giving the listener a temporary taste of weightlessness. The best of the lot is ""Homo Erectus"", which unfolds over a humming cello and spills into verdant fields of processed harmonies and keyboard. It's an interesting examination of human expansion, culminating nicely in sentiments like ""evolution don't just happen/ It takes a little time"" and ""my god has two thirds of my brain."" If that song is a launching pad for more like it, then the Merediths are worth watching. They're already quite worth listening to if you're into strongly crafted indie pop.","Debut EP from this harmony-soaked pop-psych band.

He opted into music instead, currently playing in dream-pop act Joy Zipper with long-term S.O. Tabitha Tindale. The duo's sophomore album, American Whip, has been out in England since last year, accumulating predictable comparisons to Brian Wilson, My Bloody Valentine (a given-- Kevin Shields helped mix a few tracks, and his big neon fingerprints are all over it), and Air. These takes are understandable: This particular strain of dreamy shoegaze is pure surface and form, and trying to write about it can be like trying to review a cloud: Does it look like an ice-cream cone or a mermaid? Does it matter? There's barely time to name its shape before the wind changes it again, and no matter what it looks like, it's only eddying mist. American Whip is engaging and sharply-drawn-- a spun-sugar confection of pale pinks and lemony yellows, oversaturated harmonies and gently whirring guitars, layers of liquid drone, the saccharine punch of outsized strings and horns. On ""Christmas Song"", humming organ sunrises backlight translucent clouds of guitar, slashed with deep auburn wounds by the huge, breathy harmonies. ""33x"" finds Tindale doing her cute robot number over mournful slides and drenched chamber strings, and ""Out of the Sun"" is a kicky little psych-pop smokeout with a deliriously stacked vocal chorus. If American Whip makes you viscerally confront your mortality, you're probably looking too closely, like peering at a Monet from inches away when just standing back to enjoy the tableau is the more appropriate response.","The duo's sophomore album finally gets its U.S. release.

God's Money,Gang Gang Dance,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bffd13d197565213b99a/1:1/w_160/51fbd52c.jpg,2005-04-13 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3648-gods-money/,Social Registry,"There are those who make ""noise,"" and then there are elegant, shadowy troupes cobbling ghost languages and fractured dub into undulating biospheres. Last year, Excepter's KA provided a backbeat for spinning infinitives on rusty fire escapes. And now, on their second full-length, fellow New Yorkers Gang Gang Dance have created an equally powerful record: If KA functioned as a nighttime talisman, consider God's Money its daytime companion-- music for brightly lit graffiti-scoured parks. Despite their differences, Excepter and GGD both remove restrictive compositional components and turn electro-acoustic sprawl into a generative act. It's Throbbing Gristle's ""Hot on the Heals of Love"" reconfigured as a deck of shards. God's Money's exuberant decay isn't a surprise; Gang Gang Dance have been intriguing ever since the ex-Cranium, Angelblood, Ssab Songs, and Actress members deconstructed their first denouement five years ago. But despite the linked evil-eye cover art between this and last year's Fusetron gathering, this collection jump-starts a new chapter of their sonic braille: Exit distended Ono, enter jubilant rebirth. Recorded over the course of a year at Junkyard Audio Salvage, the nine tracks are mixed smoothly, and feel woven together. Each bit has a home, like paint spread thickly across a canvas instead of in globs dropped here and there. Instrumentally, drums (hand to electronic), MIDI, synth, keys, and treated vocals gel like a percussive centipede darting through the murk of the East River. While the quartet act as a single entity, vocalist Lizzi Bougatsos emerges as a legitimate frontwoman: She knows her Living Theater and Picabia and feels at times like Karen O performing Kurt Schwitters' ""Ur Sonata"". Each track finds her ranting distantly, humming internally, and intoning over that aforementioned fractal backdrop of gentle nursery-rhyme cascades and quicksilver jaunts stitched with tiny cylindrical pulses. In a few cases, her lyrics aptly describe her function. For instance, on ""Egowar"", which features rain sticks turned into pan flutes by fauns, she ""juggles mime with laughter."" Elsewhere, ""Glory In Itself"" drops a ""shiver of mint or rotten hay,"" a suitable descriptor of the album's atmosphere, before a tyrannosaurus guitar and glimmered new wave factory synth soon to be torn asunder. It's difficult to diagram a textual storyline, but opener God's Money I (Percussion)"" launches us in medias res into tribal echos, snaps, bass de-tuned drum, and vocalizations (one voice further in the distance and the other up front counterpoint). There's a break at the end that recalls a drumline circling a drain, before GGD stop on a dime and saunter in opposing directions. The album never suspends movement: It continues to pulse and breath even in its quietest moments. And in each piece, there exists an amazing freeform beauty as well as a great sense of rhythm and melody hidden within ostensible chaos. So I'm speaking in heightened terms, sure. There's flat out so much hype in my neighborhood-- some of it deserved, quite a bit of it completely off-the-mark-- and Brooklyn's baggage has been so sweatily decried/rehashed everywhere from the tiniest zine to the Better Homes & Gardens recipe section. That kind of overkill makes me nervous, because Gang Gang Dance are one of those bands puritanical cynics avoid just because the name's dropped so regularly (and OK, they're spotted chilling with Chloe Sevigny on the downtown society page). But, whatever the art-world association or hipster evaluation points, God's Money runs laps around all those noisy minions fucking with effects pedals at their feet.","Like Excepter, Brooklyn's GGD turn electro-acoustic sprawl into a generative act.

Hey, at least these guys are better than Mexican Radiohead. Kid Aye! There's plenty to like about My Way My Love. This Tokyo trio rocks sludgy basslines and squirmy could-be-brilliant chromatic guitar riffs like the best Sonic Youth rips out there. Lovers will enjoy ""Captain""-- textbook hard 90s college rock, tuneless but with a drummer who's confident as fuck, as well as ""Sports"", which is he same song as ""Captain"" but with klaxon sirens and heavy-handed quiet-loud, and ""Sound Of Gold"", an accidental tribute to the Slint reunion tour. Haters will hate these tracks, for essentially the same reasons. Come on haters, aren't you at least somewhat charmed by this trans-Pacific indie rock/J-rock romance, a thing I may have just made up? Maybe you just don't like guitars anymore? Forget you. If the heavy stuff's too much grief-- definitely can't dance to it, eww neww-- MWML also have several short, fast songs to keep your attention. One song, ""Nanisuru?"", is six seconds long. Another, ""Jinxxxxxxxxxxsix"", is 16. Both are pretty amazing, all things considered, and very danceable. In fact, if someone heard these songs and said the band reminded him of Devo or (wait for it) Ex Models, I wouldn't protest. On songs slightly less short and fast, this band can and will kill things. ""Reykjavik 69""-- a steadily compounding mache with thick sheets of dense drum circlejerk percussion-- is the only Gang Gang Dance track you'll ever need to hear (kidding). Granted, the guitar parts on tracks like ""Ovo"" and ""Superfresh"" sell tough without the kickass traps behind it, but hey, indie rock's a fickle mistress, and she only sleeps with drummers. And so as not to spite me completely, My Way My Love do include a fake Brainiac song, and obviously it's the best song on the record. The big riff on ""Un"" stays with the song across tempo changes, and the wet production and mids-only bass make good on us nostalgics-- almost as good as when the lead singer works in his mightiest Tim Taylor robot voice.

What Comes After the Blues?,Magnolia Electric Co.,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53c13d197565213bf81/1:1/w_160/934a40d6.jpg,2005-04-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5631-what-comes-after-the-blues/,Secretly Canadian,"I was determined not to mention Neil Young in this review, as I've always felt there were more apt comparisons for Jason Molina's voice and instrumentation-- plugged and unplugged-- but dammit, where there was at least plausible deniability before, now he's announcing his Neil love loud and clear. The first splintered chords of opener ""The Dark Don't Hide It"" make it certain who Molina has on his mind-- at least on this one song. For what it's worth, he really Neils it-- ah, nails it-- and if he had enough of an allegiance to Young to stick with it for an entire album, What Comes After the Blues? might not have carried Molina's earnest, personal gravity, but it also wouldn't have been so maddeningly inconsistent. See, Molina's still drifting down midwestern highways, still a hard man to love-- ""goodbye's half the words he knows""-- breakin' hearts just as soon as he'd break a speed limit, but whether he's heading toward his nascent roots-rock future or retreating toward the ghostly isolation of his past sound is no longer as clear as it once was. From the subtly confused, subdued sound of much of the album, it may not even be clear to Molina himself. At its worst, compromise is the art of making sure all invested parties walk away unhappy, and this album reeks of such poor bargains; seeking a compromise between austerity and a fuller sound, Molina shoots for half-full but comes up with half-empty. It's just hollowed-out enough to come up empty-handed with fans his alt-country efforts may have converted, and still too rowdy to please admirers of his earlier, more somber work. The staple elements of any successful Molina effort-- his fractured, plaintive drawl and his self-fearing ruminations on his ability to transcend the base instincts of human darkness-- are still the focus of the album, however, and in this respect, Molina maintains a fearful consistency. If anything, the fragile voice that made him the Midwest's premier blue-collar indie hero has strengthened as Molina turns in some of his most impassioned performances, particularly ""Hammer Down"". Molina's continued reliance on metaphors of ghosts, the night, the moon, and the stars, and the creaky (and unrelenting) world-weariness that permeates his music could be seen by now as a lyrical crutch if not for the sense that this is less a man coasting on familiar imagery and more a man exorcising his demons the only way he knows how. ""Sometimes I forget that I've always been sick/ And I don't have the will to keep fighting it,"" he sighs on ""Hammer Down"", but the resignation in his voice is far from final; after all, as he sings on ""I Can Not Have Seen the Light"", ""It's a fair fight/ And the best that I have felt in a long time"". He's got no choice but to relish it, either; ghosts that have endured this long aren't likely to go away anytime soon. And so Molina shoulders his ever-present burden, only to be kneecapped by the instrumentation and, to a lesser extent, mild-mannered Jennie Benford (Jim & Jennie and the Pinetops). As with Magnolia's guest vocalists, Molina's particular brand of Americana never seems to fully mesh with outsiders, and although ""The Night Shift Lullaby"" is the most successful attempt yet, Benford's voice is too strong and uplifting to fit the tone of the album. Elsewhere, her frequent harmonizing is just one step in a string of odd backing decisions on Blues-- In the Aeroplane Over the Sea-esque trumpet in ""Leave the City"", organ and violins on ""Hard to Love a Man"". The desire to embellish and expand Molina's sound is admirable, but in most cases the flourishes are so conspicuous that they seem awkward and superfluous. His roots-rock foundation gives ground to more diverse compositions, but they're never fully explored, and that conflict grounds much of What Comes After the Blues? The common thread between Molina's prior work, sparse acoustic or country rock, was simplicity-- simple enough to augment rather than distract from Molina's voice, because his voice alone contained all the conflict he would ever need.","Jason Molina's first full-band studio effort as Magnolia Electric Co. is caught between roots-rock and ghostly isolation.

Once at that size, several words would arbitrarily be bolded, italicized or in Wingdings, and there'd be entire paragraphs written with ellipses. Several 70s catchphrases like ""Dy-no-mite!"" or ""Kiss mah grits!"" would be dropped, but references to iPod shuffles and Johnny Cochrane tributes would clearly indicate the year is 2005. Oh, and the review would contain 20,000 words and use a language that's half Celtic, half Elvish. Needless to say, London prog-rock trio Guapo produces some pretty far-out stuff, yet they do so with relatively familiar ingredients. Their hard-on for Magma has been extensively documented and they've clearly taken a few cues from Ipecac co-owner and Fantômas frontman Mike Patton. For the 70s fiends, they bring the mellotron and Fender Rhodes, but treat those trendy prog-rockers to sludgy basslines and caterwauling metal guitar. To top it off, the band's press releases and official website are littered with vocabulary like ""Behold!,"" ""avatar,"" ""beast,"" and ""dragon""-- further fusing the worlds of prog rock and D&D.; Sixth album Black Oni is actually part two of a trilogy starting with 2002's Five Suns, so it's no surprise many sci-fi savvy Guapo fans refer to this as the ""Empire Strikes Back record"". Not to encourage them, but the metaphor is peculiarly apt. From the gloomy black and white album art to the serpentine death marches scattered throughout the album's five tracks, Black Oni sounds more threatening than its predecessor. The Rhodes takes a back seat to more somber mellotron, organ and strings. While not exactly melodic, the album's several haunting fugues constantly mutating into one another until suddenly the squeal on final track ""V"" evaporates into nothingness, Guapo's stab at a musical cliffhanger. Unfortunately Guapo feel a little too smug with the down-in-the-dumps sound they've cultivated here. Sure, they avoid the over-the-top horror movie shtick Fantômas has been pulling on recent albums and save face for prog in general after Mars Volta's pretentious antics, but 45 minutes packed with gloom is, well, depressing. Even the darkest, longest Godspeed!-like tracks peaked at a violin trill or eerie voice sample, unlike the teasing builds Guapo start but forget to finish. Hey, I'll listen to it during D&D;, but the excitement won't be the same when my dwarf takes down a paladin.","London prog-rock trio mixes familiar ingredients into a Magma-like stew.

Folks Music,Mars Black,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a482c0084474cd0c04e2/1:1/w_160/8f4fc91f.jpg,2005-04-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1155-folks-music/,Team Love,"It's a good thing Conor Oberst's Team Love record label doesn't have any hip-hop cred because it would have undoubtedly vanished with the release of Folks Music, an amateur-at-best disc from this Omaha rapper. Of course, such a ridiculous title is akin to the funniest hick on ""Blue Collar TV"" or the most accomplished post-Pinkerton Weezer album-- any way you cut it, you're not saying much. Mars describes the Omaha hip-hop scene as ""almost non-existent"" on the Team Love website, and it's only in such a desolate music environment that his pitiful flow, painfully corny emo-rhymes, and insulting bling-boasts could exist. But all the blame for this wearying record can not be blamed on one man-- it can primarily be blamed on two. Producer-DJ E. Babbs is like the Primo to Mars' Guru-- only without the raw talent, beat-mining prowess, and smooth delivery. Babbs scratches, cuts, dips, and fades with considerable dexterity at times, but his self-produced source material is sincerely lacking. He takes Primo's peerless boom-bap style and turns it into a murky put-put mess on tracks like the Linkin Park-tinged ""In the Street"" and ""I Know Why"" with its ticky-tack garage sale drums. Meanwhile, Mars' long expired old school flow seems stuck in the pre-Rakim era. The rhyme patterns are painfully simple, and he is often found behind the beat and woefully out of breath. To make up for his lack of skill, Mars employs the ""louder means better"" strategy as he tries to put a lot of overly exuberant feeling into his words, often yelling them. On the apocalyptic ""Year of the Tiger"" Babbs provides an uncharacteristically solid production based on crusading horns but Mars ruins the track sounding like a madman screaming on a treadmill. Not a good look. Lyrically, the heartland MC puts too much stock in tired axioms like keeping it real and knowing your history. ""I'm givin' you my life, not a pack of lies,"" he says on ""Crack the Whip"". Turns out the life of a Nebraska rapper just isn't that exciting. Even when he goes against his mantra and spools out some obvious fibs, they come off as more pathetic than ego-boosting: ""I'm the Jay-Z successor,"" he spits on ""Fade to Black"", but even his moms isn't buying that. Perched in a misguided holier-than-thou pose, Mars speaks some bullshit about being true to the game in an interlude midway through the record. Talking about flash-in-the-pan MCs, he says, ""Thing is, they've got no skill...they want somebody to respect them just because they've got a little hot single."" He may be the toast of Bright Eyes' hometown but given the choice between someone like J-Kwon and Mr. Black, I'll be getting tipsy all day, every day.","Omaha hip-hop from Conor Oberst's Team Love label.

Mix 4,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70013d19756521392f2/1:1/w_160/5efc8d4e.jpg,2005-04-12 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7893-music-from-the-oc-mix-4/,Warner Bros.Warner Bros.,"An admission: I've never seen one minute of ""The O.C."" Okay, maybe I tried to catch the one minute where the one skinny girl kissed the other skinny girl. But other than that, my experience with the show is made up entirely of promos glimpsed during commercial breaks of football games...okay, of ""American Idol"". Nothing I've seen from these 30-second flashes has put me off the common conclusion that the show is just Nu-""90210"": teen drama taken to soap operatic exaggerations via an upper-bracket setting and emaciated people. If that was all, ""The O.C."" would be somewhere equivalent to ""House"" on my attentional scale, mere delay before hearing who's been voted home. But, of course, to the world Pitchfork inherits, ""The O.C."" has become much more, thanks to that scruffy haired character who doesn't look like Haley Joel Osment, and good old Death Cab for Cutie. Now mere mention of the show can induce a frantic feeling in slumped-shoulders zine-makers across the country, save for the segment that has (ironically? Double-reverse ironically? I'm too old to know any more) embraced the drama. I don't think this allergic reaction has anything to do with the classic Sellout accusation, for surely we've all reached the post-modern point where we accept capitalism and don't begrudge our favorite bands for earning their fair ca$h money. No, I think ""The O.C.""'s boogeyman role has more to do with indie fans' perception of themselves than their worry for the eternal cred souls of the bands getting national exposure. That pang you're feeling when you hear the Walkmen on the show is the realization that indie lifestyle, in all of its anti-mainstream fervor, is just as commidifiable an identity as any high school hallway archetype, fit not only for the personality of an ensemble cast member but a whole slew of show-related merchandise...do they have ""O.C."" hoodies yet? There's an uncomfortable fact about indie music underlying this realization as well, one that takes a lot of salty pride-swallowing to accept: Indie rock is just pop music, folks. Well, most of it is. It all makes so much sense in retrospect. I mean, obviously my 14-year-old fresh out of Vanilla Ice tapes self didn't fall in love with Crooked Rain Crooked Rain for Pavement's ability to innovate. It's 'cause they wrote pop songs, man, great pop songs, and even better for my age group, it was pop songs that nobody else was listening to! Well, okay, not as many people were listening to. So every time ""The O.C."" releases one of their mix tapes (this is #4), it's like The Smoking Gun digging up an old crime report on the entire indie scene, blowing the cover on 1) its feelings of isolated superiority, and 2) its supposed disdain for pop music. Hell, even in my Zen-like well-adjusted state, I mentally flinched when I noticed that fully seven of the 12 tracks on this compilation were already somewhere in my digital archives, and that most are tracks that I myself would consider putting on a mix tape. Unsurprisingly for a show that probably has a lot of montages of people walking alone on the beach and tearfully looking through shoeboxes full of old pictures and love letters and such, most of the tracks are from the glummer territories of indie rock. There's Pinback (""Fortress""), there's Sufjan (""To Be Alone With You""), and there's the Reindeer Section (""Cartwheels""), all whispery and acoustic-y. They're all fine songs, and the only thing unnerving about their inclusion is how well they segue from/into the radio-slick twee Dido-likes of Imogen Heap and Flunk. But if you hadn't already realized indie rock moved into an adult-contemporary phase a while back, you're in need of an alarm clock. More spastic moments on the show (torrid beach volleyball matches? Jacuzzi fights?) are potentially scored by Futureheads (""Decent Days and Nights"") or Modest Mouse (their dancepunk dalliance ""The View""). A.C. Newman's ""On the Table""-- like The Shins before him-- should serve as a nice gateway drug for teenagers to discover the record store, and one of Beck's new shambling country jams again make him look like the old guy at the frat party. Really, there's nothing terribly unpleasant here, save the sub-Maroon 5 act of someone called Bell X1 and a dreadful cover of ""Champagne Supernova"" from Matt Pond PA that adds nothing but string quartets and whininess to the godhead original. So if this throwaway compilation has an underlying message, it's this: You're not special. That complex, detached, artfully depressed persona you've cultivated isn't unique; in fact, it's so easily simulated, the network that also brings you ""Life on a Stick"" can replicate it. But don't let it bring you down, it's only castles burning. Accelerate the inevitable: Embrace your lack of the unique, stop liking bands for their scarcity, enjoy the full spectrum of music, not just the portions with credibility directed prefixes. And don't forget to thank ""The O.C."" for saving you some time along the way.","Fourth mixtape from the popular teen drama features music from Beck, Modest Mouse, Sufjan Stevens, and the Futureheads, among others.

The B.Coming,Beanie Sigel,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a6c0084474cd0c09f4/1:1/w_160/e2946df8.jpg,2005-04-12 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7808-the-bcoming/,Roc-A-Fella,"The first thing you need to know about The B.Coming is that nearly every track has a guest rapper or two, and nearly every one of these guest spots is perfect-- emcees playing to their strengths, finding their voices, bringing their A-games. Redman spits raw maniacal gorilla mayhem all over ""One Shot Deal"". Bun B brings his gravelly authoritative drug stories to ""Purple Rain"". Twista contributes what may be his all-time greatest guest verse to ""Gotta Have It"", wrapping his dazzling machine-gun flow around Chad Hamilton's snare shuffle with James Brown timing and Louis Armstrong nuance. A lot of very talented rappers have worked hard to make sure The B.Coming is something special. The second thing you need to know about The B.Coming is that none of these guest verses is the least bit important to the success of the album. It's nice to have them around, but the album would not suffer at all without them. Only two things matter here: the production, which is masterful, and Beanie himself, a virtuoso of lonely, bitter desperation. Beans recorded the album in the weeks between being found guilty on a federal gun charge and beginning his one-year sentence. When that sentence ends, he'll stand trial for attempted murder. He could be inside for a long, long time. Fittingly, The B.Coming is suffused with a sense of dread and regret and emptiness. ""Wanted (On the Run)"" is based on a standard rap theme-- life on the lam-- but Beans attacks the track like it was ""Life During Wartime"", breathlessly painting a bleak picture: ""You never see the daylight/ Jakes get on your tail, never let 'em see the brake light""-- a stark contrast from guest Cam'ron's blithe confidence. On the searing, gospel-infused track ""Lord Have Mercy"", he begs God for understanding and forgiveness: ""I do my dirt so my kids can see heaven on earth/ But the pain on my heart weighs heavy, it hurt"". But on the next track, the ominously cinematic ""Flatline"", he's snarling, ""Had to try to show a nigga what the metal do/ But didn't succeed; the nigga still breathing."" Even on ""Look at Me Now"", his song for the haters, Sigel sounds defiant and weary; there's not an ounce of joy in his voice. The album's producers weave a grand, sweeping tapestry to give Sigel's lament the heft and majesty it deserves. Like Ghostface's The Pretty Toney Album, The B.Coming swims in the sad signifiers of 70s soul: glistening strings, weeping guitars, swollen horns. On ""Feel It in the Air"", producer Heavy D has nothing but mournful noir saxophones for ya, baby. Ty Fyffe slathers ""Change"" in swooning, melodramatic violins. On ""Wanted (On the Run)"", da Neckbones give the chipmunk-soul treatment to Bon Jovi's ""Wanted Dead or Alive"", mining that track's theatrical sweep with stunningly funky results. Even ""Gotta Have It"", the album's only remotely club-ready track, drowns in an ugly, metallic synth wash. The tracks build on each other, swirling into a symphony of pain, a fitting soundtrack to one man's dark days.","Roc-A-Fella vet balances expert guest spots, grand, sweeping production, and lonely, bitter desperation.

Wheedle's Groove: Seattle's Finest Soul & Funk 1965-1975,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83dea9e61561daa578d/1:1/w_160/5c2b08dd.gif,2005-04-12 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2075-wheedles-groove-seattles-finest-soul-funk-1965-1975/,Light in the Attic,"I could live 10 lives and still not hear half of the worthwhile music that's out there. It's a wonderful yet frustrating feeling. Looking at the rows of funk compilations at Chicago's Dusty Groove Records is enough to give me that giddy/sad feeling that there's so much out there to explore and not enough time or money/bandwidth to hear all of it. This compilation is in those rows now, a competitor amongst hundreds for your affection, but it's definitely worth leaning toward when your geek id pokes you in the pocket looking for something vintage, unique, and mostly cohesive. If you're wondering what the heck a Wheedle is, you're probably not alone-- few remember the Seattle Supersonics' erstwhile mascot, who looked something like a giant muppet turd and supposedly lived in the Space Needle. He rode a bike around the basketball court and performed other mascotly tasks, and is sometimes reviled as the worst mascot ever amongst people who care about those kinds of things. Wheedle's resurrection as the namesake of this comp is an unlikely posthumous honor, but it works well enough: It gives character to a comp that houses music by a lot of interesting characters. Obviously, Seattle is no stranger to musical icons-- Jimi Hendrix, Ray Charles, Nirvana, and Quincy Jones all came from there-- but the city's hippie-era funk and soul scene soldiered on noticeably absent of national recognition, basically until this compilation came out. Band names like the Black on White Affair and Cold, Bold & Together emphasize the scene's diversity, and the songs are mostly filled with positive messages of better days to come and individuality. It's the kind of thing that's identifiably West Coast just from its tone-- it's brighter and thematically lighter than funk from the rest of the country, and Seattle funk has a particular rough, unpolished quality to it that makes it instantly endearing. Though it's a generally strong disc, there are several mind-blowing finds here, such as the three offerings from the Black on White Affair, a sampling that sadly constitutes most of their recorded output. These guys had a huge, ultra-gritty funk sound that rode two sick drummers with psychedelic guitar and roaring organ on top, and the opening track on the record, ""Bold Soul Sister, Bold Soul Brother,"" kicks things off with a crashing intro before settling into a sweet groove full of bubbling riffs and ride cymbal. Other gems include the tight vocal harmonies of Cold, Bold & Together's ""(Stop) Losing Your Chances"" and Dr. Leonard Roberts' mind-blowing symphonic horn arrangement on Cookin' Bag's ""This Is Me"", a song that's ridiculously tight and was reportedly nailed in one take. A handful of sample-me-please instrumentals showcase the scene's compositional virtuosity, with the choice breaks of the Johnny Lewis Trio's ""Cissy Strut"" playing nicely against the mid-tempo bump of the title track, recorded by Spokane transplants Annakonda. The best instrumental is from the Black on White Affair, whose ""A Bunch of Changes"" is filled with a sense of intricate songcraft, wailing Hammond, and tense, claustrophobic guitar. Somewhat more confusing is the Overton Berry Trio's hotel lounge recording of ""Hey Jude"", a wild improvisation built off of the big ""Nah nah nah nanana nah/ Hey, Jude""s of the original song's outro that shows the group to be quite a lot more exciting than your average hotel combo. There are some legitimate complaints to be made, chief among them that the tracklist rather unnecessarily tries to tie in three modern funk tracks to the old scene and isn't really convincing on that score. I have to hand it to the Clarence Mack Express-- they have the old hot funk sound down pat\xD0but I still would rather have been treated to a few more cuts from the era that the disc purports to cover (it doesn't help that another modern song, Misterholmes & the Brotherhood's ""Thrift Store Find"", is the most boring track on the record). Honestly, though, I can't say too many negative things about a compilation that includes Ron Buford's awesome ""Deep Soul Part 1"", a 1965 song that captures the feel of James Brown's 70s material five years early with an echoey Motown sound for a huge slab of spacious, heavy funk. On top of all the great music on hand, there's obvious enthusiasm in the liner notes by Robert Nesmith and chief compiler DJ Mr. Supreme, not to mention a ton of biographical information, session notes, photos, and anecdotal evidence that Seattle was a great place to be in love with funk in the late 60s and early 70s. In spite of a couple odd detours, Wheedle's Groove is an undeniably solid survey of a scene and an era that holds up well.","Seattle soul and funk comp picks the city's best from the mid-60s through the mid-70s.

Body/End/Basement,Single Frame,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41b13d1975652138c2f/1:1/w_160/66c731e2.gif,2005-04-11 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11827-bodyendbasement/,Volcom,"One of the few bands who can make inconsistency a virtue, Single Frame record albums that are comparable to an hour of free-form college radio, bouncing between jangly pop and electronic noise throughout their brief, hook-filled songs. After a re-released debut album (Wetheads Come Running) and a stopgap EP (Burn Radio Airtest), the band returns with an album that's no less schizophrenic but focuses on the darker, electronic elements of their mercurial sound. What they've managed to keep here is Wetheads' sense of discovery. Unfortunately, what they've left behind are the hooks that made Wetheads Come Running worth coming back to. In addition to the abrupt shifts in style between tracks, Body/End/Basement retains both the distorted, damaged electronics and the brevity of their debut-- every track except closer ""Make Yourself"" is less than three minutes long, and there is a fair share of ""skits"" and incidental pieces between songs. After an instrumental opening suite, ""I'll Lose Your Balance"" expertly builds tension, dropping chaotic guitar lines and drum machine beats between otherwise calm verses of piano and low-key vocals, before ending in guitar-thrash catharsis. The unexpected funk of ""New Black Document"" is a welcome surprise, and tracks like ""Exact Copy of This in the Basement"" push the dirty electro under the surface of Wetheads to the fore. ""Exact Copy"" may be Body's boldest and most ferocious track, and most indicative of the album as a whole-- more aggressive than Wetheads, but with fewer guitars and a paranoid atmosphere that runs throughout its stylistic tangents. After listening to their remix-heavy Burn Radio Airtest EP, it should have been obvious that the band were more interested in lo-fi experimentation than crafting ADD indie pop. I'd have expected an album of tracks more like ""Make Yourself"", which adds electronic drone and found sound while keeping its pop structure. It can't be called a sophomore slump, as Body shows a lot of the promise that their debut did, but it's a promise that I'd thought they would have built on by now.","Bouncing between jangly pop and electronic noise, Single Frame are a one-band version of freeform radio.

Our Bed Is Green,Charalambides,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e99d034d5c69bf3667/1:1/w_160/6dffc26b.jpg,2005-04-11 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1735-our-bed-is-green/,Wholly OtherWholly Other,"Debuts don't come much more singular yet unassuming than Our Bed Is Green, the first album from improvising Texan stalwarts Charalambides. Initially released on cassette in 1992, and later reissued on CD on the group's own Wholly Other imprint, this home-recorded collection finds the duo of Tom and Christina Carter tentatively marking their sonic territory at some distant nexus of loner folk, ghostly blues-based improv, and psych-guitar space rock. Now, as part of Kranky's ongoing Charalambides archival series, the album has been generously reissued in double-CD format, allowing listeners the best vantage yet to witness these formative, endearingly unpolished recordings. Thanks to its humble birth-- a couple of these tracks are so lo-fi that you can hear someone pushing the stop button on the tape recorder- and widely varying sound Our Bed Is Green often resembles a loose assemblage of demos rather than a cohesive whole. This disunity is rather accentuated by the new version's running order, which recreates the track listing of the original cassette but is an extensive rearrangement of Wholly Other's initial CD pressing. Despite this uneven playing field, however, the record remains loaded with gems, and this package also restores several tracks from the cassette, including a snappy version of the traditional tune (and long-time Grateful Dead live staple) ""Bid You Goodnight"", which had not previously appeared on CD. Unlike the longer, more fully distilled improvisations that populate Charalambides' recent albums like 2004's Joy Shapes, most of the tracks here are short and decidedly more song-oriented, placing much of Our Bed Is Green among the group's most accessible works. At the time of these recordings Tom Carter was also playing with the semi-legendary Houston psych combo The Mike Gunn, and on tracks like ""Pasé El Agora"" his electric guitar work conforms more closely to heavy-psych orthodoxy than on subsequent releases, while ""The Core"" finds him dabbling in bluesy slide guitar traditions. Despite their drumless nature, tracks like ""I Don't Know You"" and ""The Bottle"" feature what are otherwise quite conventional rock structures, and the moody, Christina-sung ""20 Hours"" is likely the closest the group have ever come to K-records style indie-acoustics. Delightful as these nuggets are, even more impressive are pieces like the crackling instrumental ""Take the Pointing Finger for the Moon"", on which the duo's guitars coil and rise like fragrant smoke, providing tantalizing glimpses of further excursions to come. Throughout the album, Charalambides perform their various wonders with the same natural, unselfconscious ease with which oak trees drop acorns. And though they sound as if they couldn't care less whether or not anyone is listening, the rest of us should be thankful to have such an available opportunity to do so.","Kranky reiusses the Texas band's first LP, originally released on cassette in 1992.

Prettier in the Dark EP,Alina Simone,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a5ea9e61561daa53f1/1:1/w_160/cd1e3a19.jpg,2005-04-11 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7807-prettier-in-the-dark-ep/,Fractured Discs,"Something old: Alina Simone's debut EP begins and ends with the Ukrainian singer's timeless voice. It's bleached and pitted like igneous rock, at times cold and remote yet tempered by the ennui of her formative years in suburban Massachusetts and the grubby glitter of New York. None of this is literal-- geography influences lyrical purview, not the innate qualities of a voice-- but since the brief intersections of divergent personal histories are of such interest to Simone, one looks to her own when attempting to understand the provenance of her tremulous coos and tortured glissandos. There's something in them that's not quite pain-- more like tension, the countervailing gravities of too many clinging roots. ""When you fall in love with two people/ Choose whoever you knew first/ Because history is important,"" she sings tellingly, on the murky, two-toned strum of the title track. Something new: Simone rejects the generically folksy strum that keeps many talented singers stuck on the coffee-shop circuit, choosing instead to wrap her smoldering voice around dark, fractured arrangements that tremble on the verge of vanishing entirely-- guitars that begin in two-note figures soon settle into one, rare embellishments like farfisa and trombone seem to come from far away, and percussion tiptoes in geological time, when it appears at all. Steve Revitte, who's best known for his production work with Liars and JSBX, should be credited for keeping the recording unfettered and spacious. If you close your eyes, you can imagine that you're hearing the music in a dim, sparsely populated nightclub, and closing your eyes is recommended: It really is prettier in the dark. Something borrowed: Cat Power's whole damn steez, most of Shannon Wright's, and a little of PJ Harvey's. Something blue: Blueness permeates Prettier in the Dark-- the deep indigo implicit in the sprawling-night-sky arrangements, the pining blue notes scattered throughout Simone's diaphragm-plumbing intonation, and her understatedly dejected lyrics. The plodding dirge ""Louisiana"" remembers a trip to the beach with an ex-lover; ""Siberia"" imagines disappearing into a pure bluish-white; ""Cash America Pawn"" is all tired waitresses and cars broken down on access roads. The hollered invocation of America at it's conclusion is the most forceful vocal on the record; it's also a bit silly, as the song switches from quiet recollection to spleeny protest for no discernible reason, and makes one thankful for the album proper's relative restraint.","Debut EP from the Ukranian-born, New York-based singer/songwriter.

Rivers Roll on By,Jim and Jennie and the Pinetops,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9faeb335119a49ec90b/1:1/w_160/f8621b2e.jpg,2005-04-11 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4255-rivers-roll-on-by/,Bloodshot,"If you've ever been in a guitar shop, you know that most of them have warmly lit, wood-paneled rooms off to the side, separated from the din of the rest of the store by a glass door. These rooms are full of acoustic guitar, banjos, mandolins, twelve-strings, and maybe an acoustic bass or two. These rooms are sanctuaries from the kid mangling ""Manic Depression"" on the budget Strat or the guy who thinks he's a slap-bass wizard. Instead, you have some old dude with a beard ripping through an incredible etude like it's no big thing. I imagine that Jim & Jennie's place looks and feels something like those rooms, bearded older guy included. If the photos in the liners to Rivers Roll on By, their fourth album, are any indication, they might actually live in a tin-roofed log cabin. Their home, the Pennsylvania countryside-- with its softened Appalachian ridges and innumerable valleys-- seems like a perfect place for music like this, a remarkably pure take on bluegrass, with only the sparest of modern twists. Traditional songs and covers of bluegrass classics are included, but the band's originals, penned by Jim Krewson and Jennie Benford, show they've also done their homework. On the faster numbers, Krewson's twangy, nasal delivery is a dead ringer for an old bluegrass picker like Roscoe Holcomb, and his voice blends nicely in close harmony with Benford's, a mezzo soprano that sounds like a mountain sunrise. The two are abetted by an able cast of fiddlers, pluckers, and pickers who give an authentic ring to old chestnuts like ""Country Boy Rock & Roll"". About the only thing here that wouldn't have fit on a Bill Monroe or Carter Family record is the occasional tasteful flourish of electric guitar, like the beautiful slide part on Benford's ""the Poison Vine"", a masterful original that could just as easily be a 150-year-old song your grandmother sang in the kitchen when you were little. Jim and Jennie split their time between stark ballads and rollicking, banjo-fueled stompers, both played with aplomb, and there's rarely a misstep. When there is, it's usually subtle-- for instance, the lyrics to ""Mt. St. Helens"" feel like they ought to be metaphorical, but they instead are literally about living on Mt. St. Helens, a topic that feels more random than apropos. It's a pretty small concern, though, and this is about as fantastic and authentic a bluegrass album as you could hope for from a group of young modern musicians.","Stark ballads and rollicking, banjo-fueled stompers dominate this mostly authentic take on bluegrass.

The Sunlandic Twins,Of Montreal,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9aaea9e61561daa7032/1:1/w_160/225a0f61.jpg,2005-04-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5955-the-sunlandic-twins/,Polyvinyl,"One drawback of being a great songwriter is that consistency is often mistaken for monotony. Witness: Of Montreal lead man Kevin Barnes, who has made his name on mirthful choruses that often sound suspiciously similar. But Barnes is anything but short on ideas, as Satanic Panic in the Attic, the band's 2004 chef d'ouvre, attests. Cumulative yet innovative, the album douses classically saccharine and vaguely psychedelic indie pop in gratuitous amounts of syrup. The key: Of Montreal handle the powerful flavors with soufflé-like gentleness. By contrast, The Sunlandic Twins, the band's new album, is like a restaurant with multiple Michelin stars serving Sno-Cones. Missing Satanic Panic's multidimensionality, the album feels like the hollowed-out shell of something great. Barnes can sleepwalk through a book of staff paper and come away with a set of leakproof pop songs-- or, in this case, a ""foray into 21st century A.D.D. electro cinematic avant-disco-- and that effortlessness lends Of Montreal's music a sort of indifference. The high-glucose diet that fueled the band's previous outings has landed them in a sugar coma. Blissfully adrift, The Sunlandic Twins lacks the essential reflexivity of Satanic Panic in the Attic's ethereally silly pop gems. The Sunlandic Twins isn't without its share of coruscating hooks and major-key shenanigans. ""Requiem for O.M.M."" is powered by a galloping bass line, which draws back to let the succinct two-line chorus take center stage. Barnes' kaleidoscopic artwork (somebody give this man a larger format) complements the music, especially ""I Was Never Young"": both seem plucked from the overripe fantasy realms of ""Sonic the Hedgehog"". The song features a laid-back, strutting rhythm, onto which the instrumentation gradually builds until a trumpet fanfare calls in a tempo change. Abetted by handclaps and a bopping guitar line, the section recalls Satanic Panic's snaking, poperatic song structures. Elsewhere, ""Forecast Fascist Future"" and ""So Begins Our Alabee"" are airy but satisfying, meeting their melody quota while managing to have some fun with synthesizers. But around its midway point, The Sunlandic Twins takes a strange turn. ""So Begins Our Alabee"" initiates the second act: a self-styled electro pop opera with a startling lack of, well, songs. This independent, self-contained experiment has no business intermingling with the respectable opening set. A few tracks outshine their surroundings by dint of simplicity. ""Oslo in the Summertime"" rescues a glistening chorus from the maw of wandering pianos, twittering drum machines, and synth glides sandwiching it. ""October Is Eternal"", meanwhile, is admirable only for its titular appositeness: The song milks a discordant piano dirge for nearly three minutes before fizzling out in an ululating vocal loop and cheap-o MIDI instruments. Of Montreal have always been silly, but The Sunlandic Twins is plain daffy. ""Wraith Pinned to the Mist and Other Games"" and ""The Party's Crashing Us"" are condescendingly aloof, piling on excessive amounts of sound: On the latter, a traffic jam of synths produces the oversaturated colors of a mangled paint palette. Particularly annoying among the record's contrivances is its frivolous use of drum machines, which skip and stutter when the songs call for simple beats. Barnes is still an impeccable craftsman, but these songs won't make your brain spongy like Satanic Panic's ""Lysergic Bliss"". This time, it sounds like Barnes is the one whose brain is gummed up. Of Montreal have accomplished the rare feat of honing an unusually nuanced signature sound. But with such a skilled songwriter at the helm, they should be making great records, checking the conceptual dalliances at the door.","Kevin Barnes and co. follow the excellent Satanic Panic in the Attic with a self-described ""foray into 21st century A.D.D. electro cinematic avant-disco.""

Bleed Like Me,Garbage,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beef5e6ef95969323315/1:1/w_160/10c4fd85.jpg,2005-04-10 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3397-bleed-like-me/,Geffen,"On the band's first three albums, Garbage snuck an enlivened libertinism into the mainstream through surprisingly melodic dance-rock songs that referenced, among other things, bondage and unisex bathrooms to comment on larger issues of control, desire, love, and even personal freedoms. Alongside Polly Jean Harvey, Garbage singer Shirley Manson was one of the most complicated and charismatic women in 90s mainstream rock, balancing power and pliability, mercurial sexuality and fears and emotions. After the commercial disappointment of the musically adventurous Beautiful Garbage, they sound like they're trying very hard to reassert themselves into our collective consciousness. Despite being billed as a guitar album, Bleed Like Me more or less reworks their successful Version 2.0 template, combining slick studio elements with ostensibly live-band instrumentation. This is, however, no comeback: The album is full of big rock guitars anchored to big rock effects, but it somehow never manages either to sound big enough or to rock hard enough. Part of the problem is the band itself, which consists of producers Butch Vig, Doug ""Duke"" Erikson, and Steve Marker. Vig's drums are, as usual, pretty much redundant, buried with the bass beneath layers of programmed beats. And all the guitars are so fastidiously sculpted that they don't even sound like guitars anymore. In the past, those previous two sentences would have been mere descriptions rather than complaints, but on Bleed Like Me, the rhythms rarely lock into a formidable groove and too often the guitars-that-don't-sound-like-guitars don't sound like anything else very interesting either. Despite its hammering riffs, ""Bad Boyfriend"", about a boyfriend who's bad but in a good way, is a surprisingly timid opener, and even Dave Grohl's drums can't liven up it up. Singing ostensibly in character, the most moxie Manson can muster is ""I've got something special for my bad boyfriend."" ""Why Don't You Come Over"" and ""Right Between the Eyes"" take shots at haters and critics, sounding defensive and distant even as Manson belts ""Stay alive my love"" Bono-style over a strangled guitar line. Whatever conflict she's describing remains merely an abstract notion, never an immediate reality. That sonic blandness makes Manson the focus of Bleed Like Me, and while her vocals retain their forceful determination, her lyrics sound uninspired and awkward. ""True love is like gold/ There's not enough to go around,"" she sings on ""Sex Is Not the Enemy"", a generic post-Janetgate call to arms. ""But then there's god and doesn't god love everyone?"" It's doubtful even the chorus-- ""A revolution is the solution""-- will change anyone's mind or even preach to the perverted. The album's nadir, ""Sex Is Not the Enemy"" is a surprisingly naïve track, unimaginative and silly, and it works better as a parody of a protest song than as an actual protest song. The disappointments color even some of the album's better moments. The first single, ""Why Do You Love Me"", is heavy and frenetic with a feverishly stomping chorus, but the verses and the whispered bridge recall Tragic Kingdom-era ""Just a Girl"" power and the song, despite its undeniable energy, ends up sounding dated. Likewise, Manson's catchy chorus and dancing-queen delivery on ""Boys Wanna Fight"" are marred by the song's predictable gender roles; with a little of the androgyny of ""Androgyny"", the song could easily fade into Franz Ferdinand's ""Michael"" on any dancefloor mix. The saving grace of Bleed Like Me may be the band's deep knowledge of rock history, which they have gleefully plundered in the past and which gives the album its only subversive spark. ""Bad Boyfriend"" cribs Foreignor's ""Hot Blooded"" almost note for note, twisting its words into a new meaning. And the propulsive ""Run Baby Run""-- the album's best track-- builds off the Crystals' ""Da Do Ron Ron"", adding an almost playful edge to Manson's dark lyrics. But it's just not enough. Despite attempts at audacity, Bleed Like Me sounds overly willing to please, which is all the more damning because it so rarely does.","After the critical and commercial disappointment of the adventurous Beautiful Garbage, Shirley Manson and co. return to their more basic, early template.

Great Lake Swimmers,Great Lake Swimmers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c01aeb335119a49ed330/1:1/w_160/836c1c7f.jpg,2005-04-10 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3672-great-lake-swimmers/,Misra,"Toronto's Great Lake Swimmers are named, of course, for the Great Lakes, which, I learned in fourth grade, separate Midwestern America from southern Canada. Appropriately, on their self-titled debut (which was released in Canada in 2003), the band sound like they have one foot in both countries: they-- or rather, on this record, head Swimmer Tony Dekker-- play a brand of ambient folk that's strikingly similar to that of Floridian Iron & Wine, but they add enough local color to make it sound more specifically local. Dekker even fashions the refrain of ""I Will Never See the Sun"" from points on a map-- ""I will never see the sun/ Spadina, St. George, Bay, and Yonge."" That's one of only a few songs on the album featuring a full band; most focus squarely on Dekker's closely miked voice and guitar. Great Lake Swimmers proudly-- occasionally too proudly-- bears the marks of its creation. It was recorded in an abandoned silo in rural Ontario, so the structure adds an echoey cry to Dekker's vocals (which sound more like Jim James than Sam Beam) and the setting infuses the songs with a constant feedback of insect noise. The few other instruments are more suggestions than sounds: A fluid bass flows beneath the songs like an underground spring, an organ tiptoes through a few tracks as if trying not to wake the sleeping. This naturalistic aesthetic suits Dekker's sadsack songs, which are stark and atmospheric, yet lyrically generous. To gauge the album's moodiness, consider this line from ""The Man With No Skin"": ""The world let me down...in a big way."" Even as his voice trails wistfully off on that last phrase, Dekker's not whining or even complaining: disappointment is a mere fact of life for him, not a personal injustice. And while he does admit on ""Moving, Shaking"" that ""It's hard to see all the little things when the big things get in the way,"" he is never too confessional that he can't see the world around him, like the ""an ant crawling across a broken tile."" Dekker can be a startlingly literal songwriter at times. On ""The Man With No Skin,"" he describes that epidermal lack in such detail that it barely qualifies as allegorical: ""Nobody wants to see a beating heart or lung or a brain."" And as the album progresses, the Swimmers portion of band name becomes a central theme, as the final two tracks, ""Three Days at Sea (Three Lost Years)"" and ""Great Lake Swimmers"", describe the dangers of water in language that makes drowning seem as much a blessing as a doom. It's a fitting metaphor for life's breakers and gales, but Dekker's voice sounds haggard and tired as he hits the high notes at the end of each line. That fatigue makes both the song and the album sound all the more mortally dire, especially when Dekker sings, ""It's such a long swim.""","Toronto natives play Iron & Wine-esque ambient folk.

Her Love Is Real...But She Is Not,Edie Sedgwick,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd04ea9e61561daa75f6/1:1/w_160/acceb845.jpg,2005-04-10 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2922-her-love-is-realbut-she-is-not/,DeSoto,"Edie Sedgwick is not the Edie Sedgwick. Edie Sedgwick is Justin Moyer doing everything you hear and see on this disc. This includes wearing a wig, some makeup, and a spangled black dress. (The press materials say that Moyer has actually undergone a ""gender transformation,"" but given that Moyer, in jeans, t-shirt, and 5-o'clock shadow, is still a member of Supersystem, let's file that fib under Cheeky Hyperbole.) Edie Sedgwick, once upon a time, was Moyer (on bass) and Ryan Hicks (on drums) jamming econo. In both cases, Edie Sedgwick performed songs in a disco-punk fashion named after and concerning celebrities. Moyer's press release claims he does this because ""the world is tired of both meaning and its absence,"" so they create ""substantial song[s] about the substanceless (sic) celebrity."" To that end, Edie blesses listeners with empty slogans like, ""When Martin Sheen is President/ I love living in the USA"", and ""Relapse, recovery!"" (from ""Robert Downey Jr."", of course). ""Lucy Liu"" features Moyer chirping ""Girl power!"" and ""Bullshit!"" in front of a spastic Nintendo soundtrack, while ""Michael J. Fox"" makes like Liquid Liquid while riffing on the near-incest of Back to the Future (""She's in my room/ She knows my moves/ She knows what's hers is mine""). While Edie claims to be avoiding any meaningful political statement, but there are two tracks about the Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""I"" is a rinky-dink dirge, bemoaning the sad life of a cyborg (""All the time I've spent in fields of fire/ No one to hear my cry""). ""II"", on the other hand, offers quick-hitting rhetoric regarding Ahnuld's rise to power (""The girlie-men keep us apprised/ Of the alpha-male's meteoric rise""), and then ends with a party-people roof-raising shout-out to areas of California en fuego (""San Diego...there's a fire burning/ Angelinos...there's a fire burning""). These tracks, in addition to ""Martin Sheen"" (drawing a straight line from Apocalypse Now to ""The West Wing""), and ""Tim Robbins"" (""Does the left have a fist?""), undercut the post-post-modern fat-free shenanigans Edie and/or Moyer are trying to have and eat. Even the album title (cribbed from the lyrics to ""Haley Joel Osment"") carries some heft, if you're willing to muse on the nature of the celebrity/fan relationship. To Edie's credit, there are also flights of fancy like the minute-long Big Black homage to Pump Up The Volume, the role call of Colonial Marines in ""Sigourney Weaver"", and the reinvention of Molly Ringwald as a biological weapon, that belie any attempts to arrive at anything remotely approaching significance. Also to Edie's credit, the focus is more on the katzenjammin' Fruity Loops swing than the loopy rhetoric s/he offers. Even if the subjects of the song don't offer much substance, there's plenty of musical meat on the bone. Though, to be totally honest, when ""Martin Sheen"" comes on, I realize that I wouldn't mind living in a USA where Jed Bartlett was president. But I digress. As does Edie Sedgwick. And thank God for that.","Justin Moyer's disco-punk songs are named after and concern celebrities.

Rossz Csillag Alatt Született,Venetian Snares,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9415e6ef959693213a3/1:1/w_160/c21299b4.jpg,2005-04-10 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8445-rossz-csillag-alatt-szuletett/,Planet µ,"Composer Reszo Seress is blamed for at least 17 suicides, as urban legend has it. His 1933 ballad, ""Öngyilkos Vasárnap"" or ""Gloomy Sunday""-- written after he made up with an ex-fiancée, but before she poisoned herself--- had been banned in the United States and his native Hungary. ""The Hungarian Suicide Song"", it was later called. Suicide notes allegedly hint to the tune's lyrics, and one tale says a delivery boy jumped off a bridge after overhearing a man whistling the song's melody. Billie Holiday, an angel who lost her wings with $750 strapped to her leg and heroin found in her apartment, later recorded an English version of Seress's song. ""Little white flowers will never awaken you/Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you/ Angels have no thought of ever returning you/ Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?/ Gloomy Sunday,"" she sang to a moon cloaked under bleary streetlight. Cynics can call that melodramatic, but the way the horns moan along with her to punctuate the end of her verses, her treatment sounds utterly convincing. Aaron Funk (Venetian Snares) appropriately covered Seress and sampled Holiday's dread on Rossz Csillag Alatt Született, his 223rd album of shattering breakbeats and post-Aphex Twin poetics in the past five years. It's also his sharpest left turn to date, although Funk's juxtaposition of drill'n'bass beats with chamber orchestral sounds has been done by others for more than a decade, most notably on Aphex Twin's I Care Because You Do. But to his credit, Funk takes a chipped, charcoal pencil and illustrates a forest of leafless trees filled with the pigeons that he daydreamt of while watching the birds at Budapest's Royal Palace. Even better, his beats work with the orchestration instead of pulverizing it for an ironic counterpoint. Funk's baroque strings fittingly strike the air, while just about every melody is played with grinded teeth and bloodshot eyes. The album title (translated ""Born Under a Bad Star""), and its songs have Hungarian titles. ""Sikertelenség"" has Funk opening a body bag to show a disbelieving piano its deceased lover. ""Szerencsétlen"" walks a rickety plank with stacco violin stabs and a grinding ""Amen"" jungle breakbeat. ""Második Galamb"" indulges in more breakcore delirium and nearly sacrifices the visceral impact of the melodies struggling to pull through. The brooding string piece ""Felbomlasztott Mentökocsi"" and the chase-sequence dramatics of ""Hajnal"" are deftest songs that Funk ever recorded. While Funk's percussive palate could have ventured beyond the standard-issued ""Amen"" breakbeats, Rossz's totality still possesses nerves that can cast shadows that never dissipate away from the mind in hours both sleeping and waking.","Another album of shattering breakbeats and post-Aphex Twin poetics from Aaron Funk.

The Getty Address,Dirty Projectors,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb61abf31b7dc7155a97/1:1/w_160/ea45541f.jpg,2005-04-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2536-the-getty-address/,Western Vinyl,"To Dirty Projectors mastermind Dave Longstreth, execution is as important as the music itself. Longstreth started The Getty Address years ago as a Yale student, eventually abandoning the project, dropping out of school, and releasing two other LPs. He's now revisited the work with a new approach, and though one could listen to the album and skim the lyrics without noticing the subtext, The Getty Address is a modern opera about post-9/11 America, the destruction of our natural wilderness, the confrontation between Hernan Cortes and the Aztecs in the early 16th century, and a protagonist named after Don Henley. Mind you, The Getty Address is compelling without the back story. Where Dirty Projectors' previous albums featured drifting song structures, Getty Address tosses verse-chorus-verse out the window and relies on stuttering, repeated musical themes. Longstreth indulges the classical influences he first explored on last year's Slaves' Graves and Ballads, but the instrumentation (strings, woodwinds, a female choir) is sampled musique concrete-style and infused with electronic R&B; beats. This isn't just opera with a little thump for flavor, though-- Longstreth comes at modern R&B; just as he does folk and classical, with a deep appreciation and an outsider's flair. It's a disjointed listen, but that's not a criticism; Longstreth has never made pop records, and this is no exception. When things click, Getty Address features a series of stunning moments: The staccato guitar and cascading beats in ""I Will Truck"", the impressionistic flutes on ""Gilt Gold Scabs"", the female vocal solo on the swinging ""Tour Along the Potomac"", the pleading yet ecstatic falsetto on ""Jolly Jolly Jolly Ego"". Longsreth's excellent voice is the most accessible point of these compositions, although on this LP he's left out the tape hiss, chirping crickets, and subway-tunnel caterwauling about Orange Crush. Crisp production suits his vocals, and his performances here are more controlled (and with a wider range) than his past work. Learning the conceit of The Getty Address didn't change my opinion of the album either way. It's a challenging concept, but Longstreth's thorough deconstruction of classical elements gives the colonization theme some precedence. And at the end of the day, it's the music that makes this Dirty Projectors' most ambitious and successful project to date.","With a convoluted backstory and a protagonist named Don Henley, this high-concept LP comes with plenty of baggage.

A Hyperactive Workout for the Flying Squad,Ocean Colour Scene,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99b9d034d5c69bf5271/1:1/w_160/76454082.jpg,2005-04-07 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5938-a-hyperactive-workout-for-the-flying-squad/,Sanctuary,"Sometimes enthusiasm goes a long way. In gym class, even if you're not that athletic you can still get that ""A"" by looking absolutely titillated during racquetball, and a little flaky bullshitting never hurt in job interviews (""Oh yes, I have a passion for burger flipping!""). And, of course, a little gusto never hurt in rock music. Without it Ocean Colour Scene would still be shambling from gig to gig in Birmingham, yet something's fishy about their sixth album's cocksure title. Don't get me wrong; they love their rock, but there's nothing ""hyperactive"" about them creatively. Guitarist Steve Cradock has undoubtedly logged countless hours absorbing classic rock fakebooks, and singer Simon Fowler attacks every song like a karaoke fiend-- a telling likeness considering three songs here are covers and several more could be misconstrued as such. How else could Fowler do his best Steve Perry on ""Another Time to Stay"" and then ape Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy on ""Have You Got the Right"", or Cradock unironically play the spandex-laden arena rock riff on ""Everything Comes at the Right Time""? Then again, there's no reason to expect a change. Ever since Liam Gallagher dubbed them ""the second-best band in Britain"" (after Oasis, obviously) in the mid-nineties, OCS have milked a Muscle Shoals/Small Faces/Mod rock fusion with little deviation but plenty of aplomb. Single ""Free My Name"" flaunts fiddles, banjos, and campfire harmonies like a musical cousin of Rod Stewart's ""Maggie May"". The thoughtlessly titled ""I Love You"", but Fowler's fervent theatrics almost dupe you into thinking he just invented the monster ballad. Occasionally their zeal pays off. ""Free My Name"" impeccably emulates the Spector sound and Fowler's got the pipes to pull off a respectable Motown howl. The cover of George Harrison's ""Wha Wha"" shows good taste, but (sigh) overeager beefy guitars and stadium-sized drumming detract from the luscious vocal hook. I've rooted for these guys because they nearly achieve that fine mix between tackiness and genius perfected by bands like T. Rex and the Darkness. Unfortunately, I can only give them points for effort.","Another workmanlike, reverent performance from OCS.

Speed,Crain,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a734b1335d7bf1698fd6/1:1/w_160/ca728e71.jpg,2005-04-07 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1803-speed/,Automatic WreckordsAutomatic Wreckords,"At the dawn of the 90s, post-hardcore quartet Crain joined their peers Slint and Rodan as a crucial component of the era's great Louisville musical diaspora, a movement whose ripples across the rock underground still reverberate to this day. Originally released in an LP-only edition of 1,000, the group's debut album Speed has, despite its scarcity, remained one of the quintessential documents of the scene. And now, packed with four previously unreleased bonus tracks, this handsome new reissue illustrates that the intervening years have done little to diminish this music's pulverizing force. With their complex song structures and dynamic rhythms, Crain bore enough resemblance to their local contemporaries to secure the always-irksome math rock tag, but in truth their sound was significantly heavier and more visceral than that vague categorization usually implies. Produced with typical unvarnished ferocity by Steve Albini, Speed is a merciless pummel from beginning to end, its brutally precise, thickly-coated riffs delivered with just enough melodic guile to lure the weary listener back inside for further exposure. At the time of Speed's recording, Crain consisted of vocalist/guitarist Joey Mudd, bassist Jon Cook, guitarist Tim Furnish, and drummer Will Chatham. (An early version of the group featured future Matmos maverick and Pitchfork wag Drew Daniel on vocals.) On the group's best tracks, such as the opening ""Car Crash Decisions"", the locomotive ""Proposed Production"", or the drag-strip ready ""King Octane"" the quartet function as a unit of almost-perfect cohesion, cornering their battleship riffs as though on rails. Each instrument is given equal weight in Albini's bracing 8-track mix, and each player proves capable of shouldering his share, although Mudd's abrasive, tormented screams are often unable to fully surface above the guitars' black, choppy waves. It's never easy to accurately gauge what influence a particular album has truly had, especially one with such a limited initial release. Suffice it to say, however, that at the very least Speed was eerily prescient in anticipating much of the subsequent work of such acts as Helmet, Jawbox and Drive Like Jehu. One could even make the argument that just maybe Albini took a few of Crain's best ideas along with him to Shellac, although naysayers would probably be just as quick to point out Crain's debts to Big Black. At any rate, fans of nervy, aggressive post-punk thud should find plenty to celebrate in this reissue, enough to hopefully spread Speed's influence even further into the future.","Louisville post-hardcore LP is finally issued on CD.

Odyssey,Fischerspooner,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdaaea9e61561daa775f/1:1/w_160/1154fc73.jpg,2005-04-07 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3074-odyssey/,Capitol,"Why exactly was I supposed to hate Fischerspooner again? They dress like spangley futuristic mime robots, which I suppose is sort of annoying, but that really doesn't have anything to do with their music. They bankrupted their record label and waited way too long to put their first album out, but again, all that stuff is strictly extra-musical. They actively and knowingly marketed themselves as electroclash, but Fischerspooner has much more in common musically with the Scissor Sisters than Miss Kittin or A.R.E. Weapons. They've never managed to make anything as great as their first single, but then ""Emerge"" was such a dizzy, searing monster jam that it'd be hopeless to hold any group to that standard forever. So the only real reason I can think of to hate Fisherspooner is the vwerdle-vwerdle-vwerdle oscillating synth-bass sound they use on every single song. This can grow tired after an entire album, but it's a good, malleable sound, as effective on breathy, luxuriant opium-disco tunes like ""A Cloud"" as on swooping, lazy filter-Fleetwood-Mac tracks like ""Happy"". And plus you can ratchet up the pitch a bunch on the chorus and the song will automatically sounds way more intense. On Odyssey, the group piles on huge, clattering drums, mournful house pianos, deliriously sleazy strutting white-funk guitars. The album's production is clean enough to sterilize needles; everything has a lavish, glossy cocaine sheen. The group has recruited help from pop-music pros like Mirwais (who produced Madonna's ""Music"", which is fucking awesome) and Linda Perry (who wrote Pink's ""Get This Party Started"", which is fucking awesome). They got the now deceased Susan Sontag to write the lyrics for ""We Need a War"", which is nice, but it's not like anyone ever listens to the lyrics on Fischerspooner songs. Odyssey is Fischerspooner's attempt at kicking and screaming their way out of punchline hell, so it's a bit of a surprise how good everything sounds. The deluxe, swirley disco tracks that begin the album slide nicely into the brittle new-wave funk and imperiously sighed synthed ballads. All of this builds beautifully to the group's cover of the Boredoms' smeary psychedelic symphony ""Circle"". It's something of a shock hearing the Boredoms' messy drum-circle monolith translated through Fischerspooner's glammy synths, but the group approaches the song with the majestic fervor it demands, and the result is a truly gorgeous pileup. Odyssey isn't a great album: Many of the vocal hooks are weak and underfed, the group never finds the widescreen abandon of ""Emerge"", and there's that synth burble on every song. But the group has managed to come up with an appealingly grand, ridiculous epic, more than anyone could reasonably expect from these forgotten freaks. So find some other band to hate. May I suggest Kings of Leon?","The electropop band's second LP doubles as its attempt at kicking and screaming its way out of punchline hell.

Despite those stylistic shifts, Jurado's dolorous tenor and elliptical narratives-- his songs resonate with the verbal economy and hallucinatory clarity of Raymond Carver's short stories-- have been constants. Also like Carver, Jurado has undertaken a dystopian survey of lower-middle-class American life. His heartland is populated by divorcees on train platforms, schizophrenic brothers, unhappy lovers trysting in secret, and world-weary teen runaways-- transient souls, out of love, with relationships doomed by untenable circumstances. On his most recent full-length, Where Shall You Take Me, Jurado's lyrics remained on point, but he traded in his emoting for a more measured, meandering style that seemed rather flat. If his recent Just in Time for Something EP presaged a partial return to form, On My Way to Absence cements it: Jurado is back to doing what he does best-- pairing simple, sprightly arrangements with mobile vocal melodies. One of those singers who can make bitterness sounds sweet, he cops a coarser, more forceful vocal turn than usual on the emblematic ""Lion Tamer"", a dreamy haze of piano, guitar, and resentment masquerading as apathy: ""You are nothing to me now."" While Jurado's lyrics have shed a bit of their specificity and retreated into a vaguer, more archetypal lovelorn stance, On My Way to Absence's melodies and arrangements are some of the catchiest, most translucently beautiful we've heard from him since Ghost of David. On album opener ""White Center"", Jurado adopts a mealy mouthed slur that makes it difficult to make out much of the content, but its easy gentility trumps its inscrutability. ""Lottery"", slicked with honeyed hums, recalls Where Will You Take Me's elegiac ""Matinee"". The velvety harmonies and quivering strings of ""Big Decision"" usher in a more hopeful sentiment: ""Got a lot of problems, think I'll work it out."" ""Simple Hello"" is the sort of spare, smoldering rock that Jason Molina might have cooked up in his Songs:Ohia guise, and the poppy folk-rock of ""Sucker"" is a throwback to Jurado's Rehearsals for Departure. This is another fine entry in a varied yet consistent career, and while it isn't Jurado's most daring work, it is among his most immediately engaging. The characters are blurrier at the edges, less strikingly defined, but the melodies are bold and vivid. All things equal, a story's told and it's done, but a melody is a book that never stops writing itself. It's melody that brings us back to a song over and over, and it's melody-- rich, fragrant and utterly human-- that Jurado leaves hanging copiously in his wake on his way to absence.","Like his fellow chameleon Richard Buckner, Damien Jurado moves between pop, rock, folk, lo-fi experiments, and Oldhamesque Americana.

Dinosaur / You're Living All Over Me / Bug,Dinosaur Jr.,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9945e6ef959693229c4/1:1/w_160/93fc6070.jpg,2005-04-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11719-dinosaur-youre-living-all-over-me-bug/,HomesteadHomestead,"I'm shocked at the relatively low-key reaction to Merge's Dinosaur Jr. reissues. Do today's cardigan undergrad massive not appreciate one of the key DNA strands of what we once unironically referred to as Alternative Rock? Was this the final victory of new wave? Will no one else admit to sporting a homemade puffy paint Black Flag t-shirt for the whole of ninth grade? It's not wholly surprising, given the deathless nature of early 80s nostalgia at the moment. The SST bands (and Dinosaur were proud to be on the label until they realized Greg Ginn's accountant was Houdini) rocked unashamedly, something very few bands do in 2005. It's understandable, given how many current rock bands came up in the 90s, a decade of unashamed rocking by unreconstructed doofuses like Collective Soul. Irony and earnestness are a precarious balance, and once hardcore went mainstream, beginning with Nirvana and peaking with Dashboard, a swerve towards brittleness and arched brows was inevitable, maybe even desirable. (Bright Eyes, ""O.C."" Mixtapes, and Matrix-rocking girl-pop shoot that theory to hell. Oh well!) The band was nothing if not earnest, but those impulses were balanced by a gentle, aw-shucks bewilderment. They were-- and either enough time has now elapsed, or I'm going to turn into a pumpkin for writing this-- the quintessential slacker band. I'm not going to detail the WMD-grade antipathy going on in the band at the time these albums were recorded, but clearly J, Lou, and Murph had yet to develop what Dr. Phil would deem fully formed personalities. They're forgiven this because, in true ""Behind the Music"" style, their inability to interact with any sense of decency may have been part of the combustion that made them one of the best guitar rock bands of my lifetime. Dinosaur were initially called Deep Wound, and played a particularly speedy and rectilinear form of hardcore that somehow wound its way across the pond and into the hands of the bands who would basically create grindcore and death metal. After the usual line-up shuffling (off to college, home from college, I don't like you anymore) and maturation (wow, there's other music than rat-a-tat 200bpm speedcore out there), they became Dinosaur. J Mascis switched from drums to a guitar that he took to playing as loud and hard as possible because it didn't have the bruising capabilities of his beloved kit. Lou Barlow played bass, not badly but too enthralled by half with Peter Hook. Murph played drums and was Murph. Dinosaur (the Jr. got safety pinned on after they became famous when a dinosaur Dinosaur came crawling out of the woodwork to protest) is, like many albums made by people just out of high school, stylistically incontinent. (This a polite way of saying it's a fucking mess.) There was all this cool music out there, new and old, and Dinosaur wanted to sound like all of it, with a hardcore base. Opener ""Bulbs of Passion"" cribs from Sonic Youth; ""Forget the Swan"" is an outtake from The Cure's Three Imaginary Boys; ""Cats in a Bowl"" shoulda called itself ""Burger Marionettes"", etc. All the songs feel like they go on longer than they should. The confusion is right there on the back cover photo. J wears his love of the Birthday Party atop his head. (Nice pendant, dungeon master.) Lou looks like Sally Jesse Raphael has just violently possessed the body of Superchunk's Mac with styling by Bill Cosby. Murph looks like he should be working at 1985 Texaco (or be in Journey's ""Separate Ways"" video). This is actually quite charming in a moment when bands spring fully formed from a stylist's imagination into their perfectly mediated debut albums within six months (coughkasbiankaiserchiefsbraverycough). It's amazing what a little growing up in public and support from your idols will do for you. In two short years, Dino went from bar band nobodies to a pop-noise outfit with a panzer attack and a heart of gold. The move to SST surely bolstered their confidence, and J's zen despondency over the guitar (he may have wanted it to sound more like drums, but you get the feeling he would have been just as happy playing a zither if it could get really heavy) burst into a particular volcanic ooze of proto-indie. Dino cut all the excess ruffage from their diet, and Murph and Lou locked into a tuff little unit that made Joe ""I like rock, me"" Carducci and Ginn want to sign them in the first place. Even the solos feel like they're being corralled by their burgeoning pop instincts. If they lumber, it's a tuneful lumbering. They discovered the sweet spot between Black Sabbath and the Buzzcocks, which every carpetbagging grunge chancer (and one or two geniuses) took to the mall a few years later. (Though, to be fair, without the grunge chancers, I'd have maybe never heard of Dino in the first place.) The album opens with skreeching chalkboard feedback before switching up for REM engineered by Swamp Thing. The opening of ""Tarpit"" casually invents all the parts of emo Rites of Spring didn't invent first, but then decides to, like, totally fucking shred. ""Poledo"", on the other hand, invents everything icky and solipsistic about indie rock in the 90s: Lou fishing for chicks in his bedroom with a four-track, an acoustic guitar, and some Stockhausen-by-way-of-Fisher-Price pause-button edits. It all climaxes with their immortal (and surprisingly reverent) cover of the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", which is a lot of fun but can't hold a candle to any of the live versions of this era, where J took the second solo as an opportunity to rend a hole in the space-time continuum. If you have any interest at all in rock music, the electric guitar, good songs, the freed weed, or teenage ennui, buy this album. Key lines: ""I'll be waiting by your window/ Please come pat me on the head/ I just want to find out/ What you're nice to me for."" Bug was recorded a year later as Dino crested on a wave of goodwill, good press, and international touring. ""Freak Scene"" is probably indie rock's greatest guitar performance and the band's greatest pop song, somehow finding room for Psychedelic Furs jangle, Edge-style ascending harmonies, Eddie Van Halen in the drunk tank, pickled country, and a cherry on top in three and a half minutes without feeling at all cluttered. ""What a mess,"" maybe, but worlds away from their debut. Bug is a tighter and cleaner a whole, and you can hear why they would soon be courted by major labels getting their noses open by first alt-rock drops of blood. You can also hear the influence/feedback loop Dino had after razing London, specifically the combo of distant sounding feedback washes and Byrdsy plucking that closes ""No Bones"", a sound cut-rate shoegazers would milk for another six years at least. ""Yeah We Know"" turns like a tank's treads flipped in the mud, each crunching snare hit at the end of the verse tricking you into think the song's about to end. ""Pond Song"" showcases what a subtly clever drummer Murph was when the noise got stripped away, and ""Budge"" is a testament to the virtues of straight-ahead pounding. ""Keep The Glove"" is a jaunty little end tune, but it was pretty sadistic to make Lou scream ""why don't you like me?"" over and over on ""Don't"", when it was increasingly clear on stage that no one in this band liked anyone. It all collapsed, absurdly half-assedly, shortly after the Bug tour when J made Murph fire Lou who didn't even get the hint at first. Dino were pretty much done at this point, though Mascis released a few more decent albums under the name-- Where You Been, in particular, was a fine slice of overlong, rangy grunge pop. Barlow formed Sebadoh, indie rock's longest running ugly late-night post-breakup phone call, and then what Stephen Malkmus neatly summarized as ""the thing with the loops."" Murph diminished into the west and remained Murph. The world suffered through a lot of bad loud-quiet-loud by guys in gas station jackets. The albums went out of print, and we sufficed with an aptly named best-of, Ear-Bleeding Country. Now Merge has reissued them in excellent new mixes (the SST version of You're Living All Over Me in particular sounded as if it had been recorded on gauze through a metal funnel) with good photos, liner notes, and slightly rejigged tracklists. Unfashionable or not, here's a band who cut through on nothing but heft, volume, songcraft, earnestness, and a kind of underrated virtuosity. Even if the on-record response was whatever, man.","Merge reissues the first three albums from these indie rock legends.

The Fallen Leaf Pages,Radar Bros.,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1dfc0084474cd0bfefb/1:1/w_160/84bd7533.jpg,2005-04-06 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6645-the-fallen-leaf-pages/,Merge,"Let's face it-- the Sunshine State isn't the same laid-back surfing and smoking utopia once immortalized by the Beach Boys and Grateful Dead. The smog is terrible, energy costs are ridiculous, its cities are overcrowded, and, hell, things got so bad its residents turned to the conservative Arnold Schwarzenegger for political guidance. Due to this discord, bright-eyed California bands like Grandaddy and Beachwood Sparks still carry the torch ""Surfin' Safari"" lit 40-some years ago, though grim undercurrents like technology and pollution bog down what would otherwise be a happy-go-lucky sound. And yet, the Radar Bros. are an ultra-mellow California trio whose previous three LPs combined couldn't wake a baby. Frontman Jim Putnam's voice is still softer than the Charmin bear and each song has the noise and intensity of an ocean breeze. Even with his most perturbed lyrics, Putnam maintains a lulling half-whisper while delivering his playfully winding, Wilson-esque melodies. However, although most of the tracks resemble permutations of Pet Sounds and Zombies chord progressions, the persistent dark undertones can't be ignored. Like Neil Young's After the Gold Rush, The Fallen Leaf Pages was recorded in Los Angeles but sounds distinctly un-L.A.. It opens with the gentle acoustic strums of ""Faces of the Damned"", a disillusioned dirge lamenting the city's violence and debauchery: ""Women lie...so gaudily on bus stop benches/ The sunlight making sure of the hatred on their faces."" Most songs, however, opt for a more implicit protest consisting of bucolic backdrops and somber pensiveness, two staple subjects not exclusive to any one Radar Bros. record. ""The River Shade"", ""The Fish"", and ""Sometime, Awhile Ago"" musically and lyrically sum up the Radar Bros. sound, and their proximity on The Fallen Leaf Pages emphasizes the band's monotonous songwriting. ""To Remember"" begins with a tense, jazzy piano line that unfortunately dissipates into a drowsy two-chord verse. ""Papillon"" churns like an angry Elliott Smith waltz, with piercing guitar licks complementing Putnam's dejected vocals. However, they're too often content to toy with a folksy acoustic shuffle and unabashedly sport their Beach Boys and Neil Young influences. I wouldn't accuse them of ripping off tunes, but their penchant to recreate the music they love leaves little room for innovation, and ultimately the album has the freshness of an unearthed time capsule.","More Zoloft rock from this mellow California trio.

"Aim High, Vol. 2",DJ TargetRiko,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbabea9e61561daa72c4/1:1/w_160/8df199e3.gif,2005-04-06 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2604-aim-high-vol-2/,Aim High,"Whether jungle (Reinforced, Moving Shadow, Suburban Base) or UK garage (Locked On, Public Demand, Tempa), in the world of faceless London beat music, labels were always the best way to gauge whether a record was going to be epochal or just DJ fodder for the week. But with grime shifting the focus to the MC and the outsized personality, it's been far easier to pick and choose by who's got the best voice, the best bars, the most magnetic mic presence. (If I had space, I could also get into murky sociological discussion about the negative influence of America and abandoning a highly developed DIY economy for scraps from the major label table.) But with Terror Danjah's Aftershock, Davinchie's Paperchase, and, the one we've gathered here today to talk about, DJ Target's Aim High, grime is finally starting to develop a community of record labels that rank with UK post-rave's best. As a producer, Target is one of grime's top boys, and I talk about him more in depth here. The first Aim High mixtape relied too heavily on nicked US rap beats buffeted by a handful of amazing grime riddims. This one is all East London and all gravy. Riko's ""Critical"" sets the stakes for everyone involved (""I ain't even got half a grand/ I'm bang on the penny"") and I bet you relate. Dogzilla's ""Never Ending Story"" conflates the cinematic reject from a cut-rate Henson creature shop with his own days on the grind. Target's hypnotic revamp of Sadie & Kano's ""So Sure"" spreads the creamy vocals and heartswell synth pulses over a grunting, pixilated bassline and rat-at-tat drums. Roll Deep continue their inexplicable slide into mawkishness with Wiley's ""Be Yourself""-- all cloying soft-soul piano trills and unctuous male R&B; chorus. So be careful you don't snap your neck with Crazy Titch's freestyle, a crazed Balkan barrage of corkscrewing fiddle, concrete block beats, and edge-of-hysteria vocals. Riko's ""Don't Want You Back"" serves an ungrateful lover their walking papers over a tablamatic riddim with flickers of 80s metal guitar snaking through. Then Roll Deep earns back a smidgen of my grudging affection with the serpentine, buzzing ""Don't Choke"". (Later, they get keys to my apartment and my ATM pin number with the aptly titled ""Hardcore"".) Riko and Godsgift's ""Dead That"" is a classic Wiley-sounding cello-bass gunman tune with particularly aggro warlord MC'ing. Breeze's ""Marching On"" sounds like a quiet storm slowjam subjected to the Todd Edwards treament, liquefied and poured over some sizzling cymbals. Breeze's ""Be Like This"" may be the funkiest grime tune yet, swinging along to a gabba terror synth snipped into a bassline. Except it may be pipped by Dream's ""Get It Done"" which, gulp, reminds me of Kanye's production for Mark Spitz's ""One More For Me"". On ""Cuz Freestyle"", Flowdan calls himself ""the human iPod"" (is that sillier than Bruza claiming he's ""running past you in the game like Sonic the Hedgehog""?) over stalker strings. If the above made you a little dizzy, wait till you hear it: Twenty-five songs crashing into each other, crushing for space, vying for your attention. Unlike jungle or UKG, with their built in stutters and beat barbs, there's little in the way of a comforting pulse to latch onto in grime. The effect is more like dancehall (little actual mixing, just slapping intensities down next to each other) or rap mixtapes (content overload.) Grime can actually be a little wearying at more than forty-five minutes a pop. But this needs to be heard for anyone interested in current beatmaking state-of-the-art.","Target's Aim High sequel helps brand one of grime's rising labels.

Unwind EP,The Rosebuds,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e7ea9e61561daa4b6a/1:1/w_160/99aaac0c.gif,2005-04-06 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6890-unwind-ep/,Merge,"All your life, it's the same thing: No dessert till you finish your vegetables. No TV till you finish your homework. No slobbery makeout attempts till you've had a conversation, or at least six drinks each. Avoid lame rockwriterisms like ""languid,"" ""pastoral,"" or ""soundscapes."" And never, never mix 60s throwback good-time rock'n'roll with languid pastoral soundscapes. North Carolina husband/wife duo the Rosebuds may not break many rules, but they do challenge that last one. The Nuggets-distilled exuberance of the catchiest tunes from their 2003 debut, Make Out, twists and shouts through half of their new six-song Unwind EP. The shimmery lullabies that seemed to break up the first record's party like an unexpected parental arrival flesh out the rest, and while they're still not as fun as the retro yeah-yeah whatsits, they make for a welcome, hazy comedown-- coasting home at 3 a.m. in a taxi instead of waiting for the subway. Like dessert or TV, The Rosebuds' uptempo numbers are sweet, immediate, and familiar. Singer/guitarist Ivan Howard's rowdy pipes sound ideal for roaring through ""Mustang Sally"", but instead they're quoting Sonny Bono (""the beat goes on"")-- at least on punchy first track ""You Better Get Ready"". Howard's inevitable ""ahh""s and ""hey-hey""s and collaborator Kelly Crisp's jumpy keyboards pick up where the debut's raucous ""Kicks in the Schoolyard"" left off. Brassy ""Edmund Street"" tosses in snakes-and-ladders piano solos and smoldering ""Spirit in the Sky"" lead guitar. ""I'd Feel Better"" closes the disc with teenage heartache and teenage schadenfreude (what's the diff, really?) over the same straight-ahead rhythm the Strokes nicked from the Velvets, or was it Modern Lovers? Either way it still gets the kids to maybe consider shaking what Chuck Taylor gave 'em. Like fresh vegetables or a Henry James novel, the slow songs are less fun and more demanding, but nearly as rewarding after they're digested. The deliberate ""El Camino"" is as spacious as Grandaddy's ""El Caminos in the West"" and as distortedly anthemic as the last few bars of Radiohead's ""Creep"". ""Is There Room?"" shuffles softly a la the debut's ""Big Heartbreak"", Howard's double-tracked vocals reflecting across a dusty hall of mirrors like Britt Daniel singing M. Ward. The title track's synth string-soaked postmodern lounge-pop reminds me of (oh god oh god oh god) the last two or three Sugar Ray hits. Not unfavorably! So rules are rules and breaking them can be good/revelatory but sometimes weird, like boxer-briefs or dessert before dinner or ""Falls Apart"" or, uh, I'd better go.","All your life, it's the same thing: No dessert till you finish your vegetables.

"Sing For Very Important People / One By One / There Is a Song / Redesigned, Vol. II",The Free Design,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be95eb335119a49ed0a5/1:1/w_160/2c264d9c.jpg,2005-04-06 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11747-sing-for-very-important-people-one-by-one-there-is-a-song-redesigned-vol-ii/,Light in the Attic,"One of the most striking things about the latest (and final) set of Free Design reissues is the flawless, almost too perfect sense of style. The colors of the inner CD booklets are bright, practically joyous (and psychedelic), but with a soft tint-- pleasant rather than brash. And just as the band decks its sleeves in flawlessly crafted fonts and color-combinations, the music contained therein hums and writhes in counterpoint with sunshine precision. It's not so much that their songs were ""technical""; rather, they were like smooth-edged, powder-blue pebbles in a jewelry store-- not as immediately demanding of attention as some of their diamond-studded contemporaries (Simon & Garfunkel, the Beach Boys), but somehow even more purely expressive, if in a precious, idealized way. These records (1970's Sing For Very Important People, 1971's One By One, and 1972's There Is a Song) track their movement into almost mystical ""easy listening"", quite possibly too much for some punk-baptized listeners. Still, like rare stones, the Free Design remind me how classic beauty and form can still be interesting. Sing For Very Important People is something of a children's album, replete with songs about cowboys, Sesame Street, familiar Free Design pastimes of kites, bubbles and even a short lullaby at the end. According to Bruce Dedrick (who would leave the band following this record), the album was partially inspired by Mary Travers becoming a mother (she of big folk-pop players Peter, Paul & Mary)-- if that seems twee, just remember Belle & Sebastian named themselves after a French kid's show. Chris Dedrick's opener ""Don't Cry, Baby"" uses lightly melancholy, but just as exquisitely placed vocal harmonies to impart its message of perseverance and love. Again, if the message matters to you, you might find yourself balking at the total lack of irony or edge. Yet, as on ""Children's Waltz"" and ""Lullaby"", the wave of pastel, hymnal harmonies are hard to deny on aesthetic grounds. About half the record contains previously released songs, which could take steam out of its impact for fans (or collectors), but even then, songs like ""Kites Are Fun"" and ""Bubbles"" are some of the best the band produced. The following year's One By One is more muted and more emotional. The songs seem a bit more personal (""One By One"", ""Friendly Man""), and the harmony arrangements are less ornate, grayer. However, I was initially surprised at how much I was digging the ""Light My Fire"" cover. For the Free Design, it'd become this jazzy, psych-lounge odyssey that should have been playing during the love scenes in all the bizarre sci-fi think pieces big at the time. Another oddity: what are A-list jazz guys Billy Cobham, Randy Brecker and Bob Mann doing on a Free Design record? ""Felt So Good"" (and the less convincing ""Go Lean on a River"") is kind of a clean version of the big band rock made infamous by Blood, Sweat & Tears, given a kick by the heavyweight ringers. My faves are the title track, ""Friendly Man"" and ""Going Back"", the latter of which should probably be copied and branded by Rufus Wainwright ASAP. There Is a Song was released in 1972, and was the Free Design's last album before reuniting for 2001's Cosmic Peekaboo. Dedrick had moved to Canada, found a spiritual mentor and made a record that is the band's most introspective. You might imagine that a somber Free Design would sound pretty interesting, and in places, they do. Their version of ""Kum Ba Yah"" (I know) is actually cool, something like the Partridge Family gone shoegaze. And to overcome any weirdness I might have regarding songs about Canada, ""Canada in Springtime"" uses a bright folk-pop arrangement Jim O'Rourke should wound for. ""Chorale"" and ""Fugue"" end the album on down notes, which seem particularly heavy considering the band wouldn't record for almost 30 years afterward. Another example of the starker, darker (if not necessarily colder) sound of There Is a Song compared to the other records is the pained, pretty version of the classic jazz ballad ""A Child Is Born"". Issued at the same time as these albums (all of which sound incredible, by the way-- the Free Design were a pristinely recorded band) is a 12"" of remixes with Danger Mouse & Murs, Caribou, Stereolab, the High Llamas, and Super Furry Animals. Caribou's epic brew of electro-psychedelia is my fave, though in general, the mixes aren't as interesting as the originals. Maybe they're supposed to make the band seem more relevant, but I think the albums do enough for themselves that fans of light pop or folk in general should be interested. The Free Design were a rare find in pop: light but not empty, pleasant but not indistinct, technically complex but unabashedly melodic. That's always a good listen.","Latest (and final) set of reissues from the soft-pop pioneers, plus a remixes album.

Open Season,British Sea Power,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ff5e6ef959693200ae/1:1/w_160/b1df4ade.jpg,2005-04-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1080-open-season/,Rough Trade,"If the 4/4 backbeats, swirling clouds of guitar sparkling with recessed synthesizers, and bright major-key leads of Open Season's first three tracks aren't proof enough, ""Like a Honeycomb"" seals it: British Sea Power have followed a clamorous post-punk debut with an album of unexpectedly gentle new-wave guitar pop that touches on, to name a few, early Cure, the Smiths, Echo and the Bunnymen, David Bowie, the Psychedelic Furs, and, most blatantly, Bossanova-era Pixies. While the entirety of this unvaried but engaging sophomore album has the nostalgic feel of 80s new wave gone arena rock, it's ""Like a Honeycomb"" that really tips British Sea Power's hand. The track recasts the Talking Heads' anti-consumerism screed ""Once in a Lifetime"" as make-out music for a middle-school prom, transmuting stark synths into arena-folk strumming and stepping all over the chorus, lyrically and melodically: ""In between the morning and the evening light/ That's how the days go by,"" Yan sings with gruff abandon. It's more bombastic and syrupy, less paranoid and stiltedly funky, but unmistakably indebted. Same as it ever was: British Sea Power's accessible new sound wasn't conjured out of thin air; these same pop melodies lurked under the distressed surface of their debut. You just had to listen closely-- around the strident guitars and train-wrecking rhythms, the barked love song to Dostoevsky and the evil dwarf harmonies-- to find them. Open Season inverts The Decline of British Sea Power's ratio of melody to dissonance, weaving thin threads of discord through sunny expanses. For a band known for unpredictability and idiosyncrasy-- performing in World War I regalia for no discernible reason, decorating their stages with fresh-cut local foliage, and interpolating their post-punk pastorales with violent outbursts and prerecorded birdsongs-- wrangling their esoteric lyrics into simple verse/chorus/verse patterns and rounding off the acute angles of their guitars is rather ingenious. They've unpredictably become predictable. Predictability, in the context of a record review, isn't usually a compliment. But a one-trick pony's not so bad if it's a good enough trick, and the resultant feeling of familiarity will be more akin to that of a kid anticipating another long summer than a jaded adult staring down the barrel of another work week. Retaining his arcane subjects but couching them in deceptively simple terms, Yan traffics in some tricky lyrical inversions. If you want to sing about death in a pop song, you've got to make it sound as if you're singing about love, and at least two songs on Open Season pull this off. On ""It Ended on an Oily Stage"", Yan sings ""I wrote elegiac stanzas for you/ I hope and pray that they come true"" with such earnest tenderness that it takes a minute to register that an elegy is a lament for someone deceased. ""North Hanging Rock""-- a weightless, atmospheric trellis that guitar and piano snake through like ivy-- is the most superficially sweet song about death (""Drape yourself in greenery/ Become part of the scenery"") this side of Modest Mouse. And on ""Oh Larsen B"", Yan's invitation to his ""favorite foremost coastal Antarctic shelf"" to ""fall on me"" could be construed as either lovelorn or suicidal. By maintaining their singular aesthetic while venturing into more inviting pop sounds, the weirdest band from Brighton just might have become the smartest.","On its sophomore LP, the UK band trades idiosyncrasy for accessible pop melodies.

The John Byrd EP,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8df5e6ef959693212e2/1:1/w_160/24933ed2.jpg,2005-04-05 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2234-the-john-byrd-ep/,Barsuk,"When Death Cab for Cutie announced their amicable separation from Seattle-based indie label Barsuk-- simultaneously publicizing their signing with Atlantic Records-- nobody was shocked or appalled: The band's major label bump-up seemed stupidly pre-destined (slept-on, almost), the next and only logical step for a group regularly and glibly name-checked by cast members of ""The O.C."" (In a wincingly obvious confirmation of taste, a live guest performance by the band has already been scheduled for later this month.) Regardless, the past year has been appropriately transitional for Death Cab, as the band settles into its emerging popularity (a groundswell augmented, no doubt, by frontman Ben Gibbard's half-million-selling side-project, the Postal Service), shifting from tiny clubs to decent-sized theaters, and becoming accustomed to the quirks of dealing directly with a colossal corporation. Sold only in independent record stores, the seven-song The John Byrd EP-- blushingly named after the band's dutiful sound man (""The guy in the beard and glasses,"" Gibbard banters)-- collects seven live tracks (culled from shows at the Fillmore in San Francisco, the Wiltern in Los Angeles, and the Showbox in the band's hometown of Seattle) has the cobbled-together, vaguely desperate feeling of an awkward apology-- an earnest thanks to the folks on their crew and their support staff Barsuk, a fraught promise to fans, an unbreakable testament to the band-before-the-breakthrough. Conceptually, it's preemptive and timid; in actuality, the EP is perfectly nice but underwhelming and bland, a non-essential gesture from an outfit in flux. ""We Laugh Indoors"", plucked from 2001's The Photo Album, is a comparably limp opener, with Gibbard's voice quiet, flitting in and out, lyrics unintelligible. Guitarist Chris Walla plucks out a meandering melody over a lazy haze of drums and guitar, sounding oddly detached and lifeless-- until two minutes in, when the band half-heartedly commits to some kind of energetic burst, Gibbard finally aiming for a microphone, his bandmates taking a woozy stab at redemption that works, sort of. The nine-minute ""We Looked Like Giants"" can be equally tiring-- all guitar wankery and live finesse that falls flat on record. ""Photobooth"" is excellent, sped-up, and animated, doing its best to engage a crowd that sounds (unsurprisingly) distant, all crossed-arms and cool stares. The EP closes with a solid cover of Sebadoh's ""Brand New Love"" (led into by ""Blacking Out the Friction""). A few lyrics are switched, guitars wail, tempos trip up and down, and Gibbard's crowd chatter is charming enough, but the John Byrd EP is mostly just a pleasant boon for completists, more interesting for its timing than anything else. Death Cab for Cutie may, ostensibly, be teetering on the edge of newness-- but if this EP is any indication, they've already got their formula nailed down perfectly.","Death Cab say goodbye to Barsuk with this seven-track live EP.

Ex Hex,The Mary Timony Band,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b6b1335d7bf16990f0/1:1/w_160/76956ca6.gif,2005-04-05 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8067-ex-hex/,Lookout!,"If you were into Mary Timony's art-pop band Helium, chances are you were also into Polvo, or, more specifically, the baroque cathedrals shared member Ash Bowie hewed from his guitar. If you were into Helium and Polvo, you probably loved intricately braided strands of melody and dissonance, art-school meets meat-and-potatoes punk a la the Breeders and Autoclave (Timony's first band), and tight packets of oblique imagery. And if you were into all of that, you were probably turned off when Timony went solo and started mining Tolkien for lyrics and Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute for musical inspiration. I guess if you're a Boston hipster and you want to check out the Ren Fair, solo is about the only way you're going to go. As a closet ""literary fantasy"" buff, I can sympathize with the impulse to reclaim the allegorical potency of works like The Thousand and One Arabian Nights from hokey sword-and-sorcery books. Writers like Neil Gaiman and filmmakers like Hayao Miyazaki have been instrumental in preserving the rich metaphorical cores of mythological archetypes against the depredations of trite fantasy franchises, but a similar savior has yet to come along in music: Elves are adorable, but even an unabashed Sandman fan like myself can't stomach their cavorting in the context of a song. If you've been turned off by the ponderous whimsy of Mary Timony's solo output to date and pine for the sweetly sinister discord of Helium, you'll be pleased to learn that Ex Hex is a well-grounded return to form with decidedly terrestrial lyrics about uncommunicative men (on the plodding minor-key dirge ""Silence"") and the inconvenience of having drunks sleeping on your floor (on the fuzzy rock stomper ""On the Floor""). This is raw and raucous rock-- pounding drums, throttled prog riffs and breathy, hypnotic invocations. When Timony dips into fantasy, it takes the form of religious dread, as on ""In the Grass"": ""Even I know the fiery place you can go,"" she sings into a starry cascade of guitar. ""Return to Pirates"" chimes and chugs through knotty chordage; ""Friend to J.C."" wails like stressed metal; ""Backwards/Forwards"" nearly plagiarizes the laddering riff from Modest Mouse's ""Shit Luck"" to close the album with a snarl. Brendan Canty's stark production lays out the rattling percussion, serpentine leads and woozy, serrated chords in a lean procession that emphasizes the songs' dark, rugged beauty. Many of the riffs are righteously medieval in tone, but they rework those tripping arpeggios for a scorched-earth rock setting, without a lute, zither or lyre within earshot.","On her latest, the former Helium singer abandons ponderous whimsy.

The Push Pull,David Last,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde313d197565213b644/1:1/w_160/8ec2a27d.jpg,2005-04-05 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4983-the-push-pull/,theAgriculture,"""Illbient"" was a good idea with a terrible name. If ambient is often a highfalutin' way of saying ""mood music"" in the old-fashioned wine bar/yuppie high-rise sense, most people don't live in Arcadian forests or soundproofed lofts. As David Toop pointed out in last year's headwrecking Haunted Weather, most of us live with ambient noise levels that our ancestors of 200 years ago could only associate with times of war. Planes, trains, automobiles...many of us can't even get to sleep without a distant roar or clatter hovering overhead. And, increasingly, music. The dull, subharmonic rumble of a passing truck with illegal bassbins. The endless clank-clank of a reggaeton drum pattern through the wall of the apartment next door. Urban street beats culture gets into you whether you want it to or not. Illbient embraced it, updating Eno's original theories with a little grime under its nails, taking hip-hop as its DNA. Brooklyn label theAgriculture has mined the inexhaustible lode of beats and textures far past its sell-by date in the style press. Its first masterpiece was Nettle's Build A Fort, Set That On Fire, a record that made like Oval and dancehall producers Steely & Cleevie working over a cassette of underground rai hits. Now, they've released their best record yet with David Last's The Push Pull. Last's sense of rhythm is as developed as any rap, dancehall, broken beat, or dubstep scientist you'd care to throw up. Whereas most post-downtempo electronic music shifts the burden of interest to the melodic/harmonic, Last's swinging beats and liquid metal bass throw all the weight on the rhythm section. This is a funky, funky record. On ""Secret Society"", a mutant dancehall pattern bumps to static offbeats and a hiccuping vocal that's an integral part of the groove. When Last drops a rattling, chiming melody, it's more rhythmic than simple coloration. ""Badlands"" filets some microsamples over percolating handclaps, bubbling steel drums, and a one-note bass plummet that'd rattle your teeth at the appropriate volume. There's also a playfulness that takes it out of the city into more unmapped terrain. ""Besitos"" plucks and weaves like The West-era Matmos. ""Posca Kid"" pivots on a mournful little accordion melody over a doleful skank, surrounded by blips, blorps, burps, and other IDM onomatopoeia. There's also a faint taste of classic Black Dog running throughout, the evanescent Orientalism of tracks like ""Chiba"" and Balil's ""Nort Route"". (This is no bad thing.) Like the ""Coolie Dance"" and ""Egyptian riddims, Last has found a music that sounds urban and folksy, ancient and modern all at once.

Par Noussss Touss Les Trous De Vos Crânes,Et Sans,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0313d197565213b454/1:1/w_160/82a6ef3e.gif,2005-04-05 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2921-par-noussss-touss-les-trous-de-vos-cranes/,Alien8,"When Et Sans released their 2002 debut on the Locust label, the project was a duo consisting only of Montreal music vets Roger Tellier-Craig (Fly Pan Am, ex-Godspeed! You Black Emperor) and Alexander St-Onge (Shalabi Effect), and that album's airy, minimalist electronics were a welcome departure from the expansive orchestrations typically associated with the Constellation crowd. Since that time the group has added Stephen De Oliviera, Fly Pan Am drummer Felix Morel, and G!YBE's Sophie Trudeau. Despite this additional instrumental heft, however, Et Sans have remained faithful to their stripped-down, primal pulse and Par Noussss Touss Les Trous De Vos Crânes (the loose translation of which involves something about holes in your cranium) presents the expanded lineup in full flutter. Though Par Noussss Touss is divided into four extended tracks, it seems intended to be best digested as one continuous piece. Throughout the album Et Sans artfully combine electronic and acoustic instruments in a manner that disguises the origins of each individual sound, with snatches of indistinct vocals-- some cooed, some hollered-- cascading in and around the music's crackled landscape. At various points these tracks do recall some of the more abstract junctures of Fly Pan Am's 2004 N'Ecoutez Pas album, but Et Sans in general prefer to take that group's Krautrock-inspired repetitions in a harsher, more experimental direction. Here they open things with a prolonged hush, as male and female voices exchange whispers over a sparse, barely-moving riverbed of hazy, distorted tape samples. But it's not long before things become considerably more agitated and the group's insistent keyboards gradually build into a sinister, Suicide-like pounding, the vocalists' virtually wordless exhalations take on an increasingly ominous urgency, and swarms of electronically-generated insects gather in numbers on every horizon. In fact, things eventually become so unhinged that during the album's noisiest stretches it's only Morel's dogged drumbeat and the keyboard's steady one-fisted propulsion that keeps Et Sans' flywheel from spinning completely out of control. Squealing radio waves and tapes of briefly recognizable reeds, guitars, and strings meet in various stages of disintegration, while disembodied voices chant opaquely and an impressive monolithic drone grows strength beneath it all. In their fully extended line-up Et Sans have gigged alongside the likes of Wolf Eyes and Black Dice, and the more raucous sections of Par Noussss match those acts in spirit if not always in execution. And now that Et Sans more than ever resembles a full-fledged band, it should prove gratifying to watch as they further hone their distinctive brand of quiet thunder.","When Et Sans released their 2002 debut on the Locust label, the project was a duo consisting only of Montreal ...

Bigger Than Blue / The Beloved Enemy,Jay Bennett,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26f9d034d5c69bf2bcb/1:1/w_160/d961710f.jpg,2005-04-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11673-bigger-than-blue-the-beloved-enemy/,Undertow,"For better or worse, Jay Bennett will probably always be known as The Guy Who Used to Be in Wilco. The success of that venerable Chicago band will likely loom over the rest of his career, and his parting with longtime bandmate Jeff Tweedy has exploded into (semi)legend, thanks in part to Sam Jones's 2002 documentary I Am Trying to Break Your Heart, which captured Tweedy at his most aloof and Bennett at his most neurotically exacting. As Wilco approach even widerspread notoriety, Bennett is rebounding with extreme determination. Since departing the band, he released one album with Edward Burch (The Palace at 4 AM), and not one but two solos albums, The Beloved Enemy and Bigger Than Blue; a third full-length, The Magnificent Defeat, tentatively scheduled for fall 2005, will complete the trilogy. That matches the number of albums Wilco released during Bennett's six-year tenure (if you count his involvement with A.M.). However he may come across in grainy black-and-white, Bennett is-- as these first two solo albums attest-- a musician whose ambitions almost outshine his undeniable talent. ""A lot of times when you're playing,"" Bennett comments in I Am Trying to Break Your Heart, ""if you don't have any kind of sonic landscape behind you, everything kind of turns into a folk song."" Appropriately, both of these albums are full of folk songs with some sort of sonic landscape draped around them, sculpted at Pieholden Suite Studio in Chicago. On Bigger Than Blue that landscape is minimal and more or less subjected to the demands of the songs, but on The Beloved Enemy Bennett indulges seemingly every whim that crosses his mind. He uses many of the same tricks that helped Being There, Summerteeth, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sound so distinctive; these solo albums, in other words, are no dramatic departure. Of the two, Bigger Than Blue is more confident, cohesive, accomplished, and, perhaps tellingly, far less fussed over. ""My Little Wicked One"" and ""Outside Looking In"" feature only Bennett and his acoustic guitar, while a few tracks, like the Byrdsy ""Charming and Plastic"" and the George Harrison-haunted ""Let's Count Our Losses"", are enlivened by a small backing band that effectively draws out the melodies. ""It's Hard"" churns out a barroom dirge to match his lyrics about self-delusion and regret, and ""Curiosity"" has a gentle bounce to it, thanks to Brendan Gambel's brushed snare rhythms and Bennett's impassioned delivery, which recalls Elvis Costello in its rough-edged precision. Bigger Than Blue dips momentarily with the self-conscious ""Reasons for You to Love Me (Cars Can't Escape)"", which sounds like an overworked Wilco outtake. While the folksy guitar strum of ""Songs That Weren't Finished"" rights the album in time for its final track, ""Reasons for You to Love Me"" sounds out of place among so many more or less straightforward arrangements; it's more apt for The Beloved Enemy, which has a lonely, restless vibe-- the opposite of Bigger Than Blue's shambling ease. On this second album, Bennett is much more concerned with-- or distracted by-- the creation of a sonic landscape. Unfortunately, these songs are all so uniformly downtempo that his heavy production weighs them down and dampens their melodies; as a result, the album fails to establish any pace or momentum, but can only trudge leadenly along. At its most lively, it sounds like it's tumbling apart, with instruments rattling into a song and then falling away. This technique is only sporadically effective: it works on ""Genevera"", for instance, but not on ""It Might Have Looked Like Were Dancing"". Overused on The Beloved Enemy, it's too often obtrusive and unmoving. Despite the difference in approaches and results, Bigger Than Blue and The Beloved Enemy work better as counterparts than as sovereign works: Taken together, they portray the surprise of abandonment, whether it's due to the dissolution of a band, the breakup of a marriage, or the death of a loved one (in addition to losing a few friends and relatives, Bennett went through a divorce prior to recording these albums). On one hand, he avoids lapsing into bitterness or blame, but sounds resigned to the disappointment of so many missed opportunities. On the other hand, these two albums cannot help but remind listeners of Bennett's previous collaboration, and that familiarity keeps him well within the penumbra of Wilco's looming shadow. Perhaps his upcoming third album with put much-needed distance between Bennett the sideman and Bennett the solo artist.","First two parts of a trilogy from the former Wilco man; the finale is due out this fall.

Alligator,The National,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3aa5e6ef959693238a6/1:1/w_160/5ef3ddb6.jpg,2005-04-04 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5719-alligator/,Beggars Banquet,"The National are stuck somewhere in the emotional recesses of life, the characters in their songs adrift on roads both literal and metaphorical. They're stuck between the country and the city, but not in the suburban or exurban senses-- their music reveals the parallels between small-town everybody-knows-everybody drama and big-city alienation. The Brooklyn (via Cincinnati) quintet engage with their American anxiety with a somewhat European elegance, and Alligator-- their third album and first for Beggars Banquet-- finds them pushing the tempos and trying on bigger shoes without losing the stately sense of pacing and dour melody that made their first two albums so pleasing. Drummer Bryan Devendorf is the backbone of Alligator, his efficient, well-textured timekeeping featuring high in the mix and neatly delineating the band's newfound sense of rhythmic consistency. The music around him moves between lushness and austerity, bursting with chamber pop ornament and collapsing into wasted after-hours reverie. Matt Berninger's dry baritone deadpan is strangely emotional-- at times he almost sounds too tired of life to aim for a high note, and it brings an odd honesty to lines like ""I'm sorry for everything."" As he repeats the line over the violins and roiling guitars of ""Baby, We'll Be Fine"", he seems as if he's not only apologizing for everything he's ever done, but also everything that's ever happened that he couldn't control. The slower, piano-driven death-pop of ""Karen"" offers some unusual chord progressions as Berninger warns a fading lover: ""Whatever you do, listen/ You better wait for me/ No, I wouldn't go out alone into America."" ""This isn't me, you just haven't seen my good side yet,"" he tells her, but he's obviously doomed and he grows more desperate as metaphorical black birds circle his bed. On ""Lit Up"", he grows more confident, even swaggering: ""My body guard shows a revolver to anyone who asks"" he deadpans gracefully over jagged electric guitars, while his band shouts along for the chorus. The shouted chorus returns for the ""Thunder Road""-sized rocker ""Abel"", the closest the National have come to writing an anthem. Massed vocals and backing harmonies are two of the few things the National have added to their sound since their last album, and though Alligator is satisfying and engaging, it's not quite as bracing as their stellar sophomore outing, 2003's Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers. Still, the band's nocturnal vision of American pavement and deteriorated personal relations is engrossing, revealing itself slowly, peeling back the luxuriant layers and exposing intricate detail.","Brooklyn quintet explore the parallels between small-town drama and big-city alienation.

Am Byth: Casgliad O Ganeuon Coll '86-'92,Ffa Coffi Pawb,by: Stephen M.

The Welsh phrase proves a particularly ironic title for this rarities collection, not only because the band in question, Ffa Cowfi Pawb, has been defunct for more than a decade, but also because it has been handily overshadowed by its members' subsequent groups. Gruff Rhys and Daffyd Ieuan co-founded Super Furry Animals in 1993, Rhodri Puw joined Gorky's Zygotic Mynci after John Lawrence left, and Dewi Emlyn has toured with those two bands as well as Mogwai and Cornelius, among others. By comparison, Ffa Coffi Pawb (which means ""everybody's coffee beans"") is basically obscure, at least to non-Welsh audiences. Formed in 1986, when they were university students, the band called it quits seven years later when heavy touring of Wales led to almost no touring outside of Wales. They released four albums altogether (three on Welsh label Ankst), but none are in print. Am Byth is their only surviving record, as of this writing anyway. But that title isn't some Oasis-size declaration of self-importance; it's more like a mission statement. Ffa Coffi Pawb wanted to make durable music. ""Lluchia Dy Ffachlwch Drosda I"" (""Throw Your Flashdust Over Me"") reveals a strong belief in music's redemptive powers: According to Gruf Rhys's liner notes and translations, it's about ""the realization that the Earth is a flop and that sometimes the only friend we can turn to is dumb rhyming pop music."" Thirteen years after the band's dissolution, their music holds up surprisingly well, especially considering all we have to judge it by are 16 ""lost songs,"" as the subtitle dubs them. Despite being one of the most recent songs on the album, the opener ""Valium"" starts with an 1980s-sounding drum machine that screams ""Cardiff Vice"", but most tracks don't seem to have aged much. Some are single-worthy gems, like ""Segur Sega"" (""Lazy/Redundant Sega"") and ""Arwynebol Melyn"" (""Yellow Superficial Pony""). Others, like ""Hydref yn Sacramento"" (""The Fall in Sacramento""), go on and on without having much going on at all, suggesting a young band that didn't have full control yet over its own creative powers. It's easy to pick out the similarities between Ffa Coffi Pawb and their direct progeny, especially Super Furry Animals-- that's unmistakably Rhys's voice delivering those consonant-heavy lyrics, and that soaring three-note harmony on ""Segur Sega"" and those dreamy na-na-nas on ""Breichiau Hir"" (""Long Arms"") are prototype elements of the bouncy boogie of Radiator and Guerilla. As a result, it's now difficult to hear Ffa Coffi Pawb as its own distinct entity, but rather as the lead-up to other bands. Maybe those four ""lost"" albums tell a different story.","Early recordings from a Welsh band that included Gruff Rhys, fellow Super Furry Daffyd Ieuan, and Gorky's member Rhodri Puw.

Irrevocably Overdriven Break Freakout Megamix,Hrvatski,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c134c0084474cd0c32d0/1:1/w_160/51c79dde.gif,2005-04-04 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3946-irrevocably-overdriven-break-freakout-megamix/,Enschuldigen,"I always felt slightly disoriented whenever I left the recording studio at Rocklin High School in California. I blame it on the din of education: a dozen-odd classmates pouring their souls or resisting narcoleptic boredom by pecking at a synthesizers, drum machines, and effects processors, murdering their favorite Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins songs on out-of-tune acoustic guitars, or taking five-minute turns playing medleys of Primus songs on a battered trapkit. Whatever instrument or studio equipment used, there was a tendency to first be benignly calm in studying what each sound or widget can do, before the adolescence kicks in and taxpayers are left with the thousands in repair bills. Such memories hit me when I heard Irrevocably Overdriven Break Freakout Megamix, the first and possibly sole live document of Hrvatski-- recorded in San Francisco's RX Gallery during the Jiffy Scuttler concert series on July 30, 2004. This ""Croatian"" is the alias for Yankee noisenik Keith Fullerton Whitman. He is a Berklee-educated, electronic music historian who concocted mature pieces for guitar feedback, and experimented with Harvard University's Serge synthesizer. Yet, as Hrvatski, he typically follows moments of graceful meditation on his guitar or synth with splatters of beats and frequencies tweaked into high heaven. It seems Whitman has three basic noises locked into his mind: Drones that drizzle trails behind every moving object, as heard in the projects authored under his Christian name; toy store-bought, zapper-gun buckshot; and his the ""Amen"" breakbeat-- operated like dilapidated steel factories run by sleep-deprived, sweatshop workers. If anything, Whitman is a pioneer of ""fuckstep,"" the art of shoving as many different breaks into a split-second as a possible. That said, Irrevocably Overdriven could be one hell of an epitaph for Hrvatski. On his label Reckankomplex's website, he claimed this ""will most likely be Hrvatski's swan song."" That would be a damn shame; the laptop performance encompasses Hrvatski's seven-odd years of savagery and slapstick-- all caught in volumes cranked into the red on the recording deck. The set, which he describes as ""incorporating the guts of an analogue modular synth simulator, several pitch-tracking and attack-sensing random-event distributors, many tempo-synced filtering algorithms, 10 kinds of realtime granular grunkage, etc.,"" is a marvel to be pulverized with in one sitting. The 40-minute concert is divided into 91 segments, ranging from 20 seconds to one minute long, but the performance feels as if lasts for three hours. He shows off his studies of about every square-inch of that damn ""Amen"" break-- making its soul float above its body or slowing it down to a cement mixer grind. The performance disrupts any sort of dance hooks by veering back and forth between beat assaults, their digitally enchanted smoldering of distortion, some tomfoolery with laser or robotic blurps, and then it's back to the firing squad. Whitman thankfully makes most of the discord addictive, deepening his sound's depth and textures by keeping it slightly distant with an echo. The best moments are surprises like a jazz piano melody that suddenly asks you for a dance amid the street riot, a Nintendo Gameboy melody that whistles on its way to work, and tracks from his sadly overlooked 7"" EP, Raume, where Whitman mutated household objects like pots, pans, bedsprings, and creaking doors into breakcore rhythms. The self-indulgence can be too much at times, where Whitman often pulls apart his noises and leaves nightmares on the petri dish. However, if Irrevocably Overdriven is indeed his last recording as Hrvatski, then the dying breaths of this Whitman alias can be heard across all four winds on this record.","On what may be his Hrvatski swansong, Keith Fullerton Whitman squeezes 91 segments into 40 minutes.

Live! 30 Days Ago,Phoenix,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05fb1335d7bf1697fde/1:1/w_160/b2a37e09.gif,2005-04-04 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6274-live-30-days-ago/,Astralwerks,"Contemporary live releases are dogged by the success of modern recording technology, which creates a prototype that's difficult to top onstage. And Phoenix, who thrive in a studio, mistakenly try to raise the intensity and vibrancy of their songs on this perhaps unnecessary live album. ""Funky Squaredance"", replete with Styx-sized guitars and synthesizers, gets the arena rock treatment and ends up sounding forced and out of sorts. The seven-minute ""If I Ever Feel Better"" impeccably emulates the studio version until descending into an attempt at Brian May-like guitar theatrics. Phoenix's song selection is party to blame for the record's failures: Six of the 10 tracks come from Alphabetical, the weaker of their two albums, yet with few exceptions those tracks fall short of their studio counterparts. However, when it comes to a few of the singles, the band knows how to bring it home. ""Too Young"" is one of few Phoenix songs truly made for the stage, with its pounding, scintillating synth and a bubbly Thomas Mars almost raising his voice above speaking level. Guitarist Christian Mazzalai drops the acoustic on ""Everything Is Everything"" for a clean, funky electric, making that nifty jazz progression throb even harder. Aside from these differences, the live versions mostly sound like their originals with an adjusted EQ and crowd sounds randomly interspersed. Mars appears uncomfortable addressing the audience unless to announce a song title or say goodnight, and it's very likely this album was hastily assembled to promote the band before their big U.S. tour. As an already dubious release, the disc lacks cool extras like a bonus DVD, unreleased tracks, or inserts and there are undoubtedly more inspired Phoenix performances than those compiled here. Sadly, like most of today's live records, this one is for fans only.","French pop band goes the live route despite having only two LPs to their name.

Lost and Safe,The Books,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3449d034d5c69bf2d99/1:1/w_160/84067651.jpg,2005-04-04 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/856-lost-and-safe/,Tomlab,"Over two albums, the Books have plucked sampled voices from their original context and arranged them inside simple compositions for sliced-and-diced guitar, banjo, and cello. They've taken moments of contemplation-- when one understands something on an emotional level but can't quite articulate his thoughts-- and dressed it up in a melodic frame. By transmitting at the frequency of pre-conscious association and intuition, Thought for Food and The Lemon of Pink were immediately accessible despite absences of obvious reference points. Both records felt like gifts, demanding little from the listener but paying out handsomely. With their fresh sound and economic construction (the first two releases were each under 40 minutes), the Books did well to stick to a similar template on back-to-back records. But in preparing for their third album, one senses Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong felt as if they'd mastered this approach and needed to try something different. On Lost and Safe, the Books take the vocals and song structures hinted at on Thought for Food and fleshed out on The Lemon of Pink and make them the centerpiece. This time it's Zammuto alone on the mic; Anne Doerner, whose spare vocal contributions to The Lemon of Pink wound up being a highlight, doesn't sing any lead. There's more processed electric guitar (often used in a clicking, repetitive manner reminiscent of classical minimalism) and far less cello. Despite live vocals on nearly every track and the shifts in texture, the approach is still very recognizably the Books. In a way, the original lyrics aim for the same level of engagement as the odd samples, finding and skirting the edge between different meanings. ""Yes and no are just distinguished by distinction, so we chose the in-between"" are the first words Zammuto sings in his hushed whisper on the opening ""A Little Longing Goes Away"", and that sort of ambiguity sets the tone for the record. Words for the Books have been a subject in and of themselves, worth hearing purely as sound, and the written lyrics here have a similar character. Most of Lost and Safe is pleasant enough but not much more. ""Be Good to Them Always"" is the record's lone great track, one that hints at potential interesting directions down the road. As clicky electric guitar with some backward reverb pans across the stereo field, Zammuto sings in concert with the sampled voices, finding the hidden melody in the deadpan newsman deliver of lines like ""I can hear a collective rumbling in America"" and ""This great society is going smash."" Reminiscent of Steve Reich's ""Different Trains"", which built tunes from the speech inflections of interviewed holocaust survivors, ""Be Good to Them Always"" is a fantastic reminder of the musicality of the spoken word, an idea that lurks constantly inside the music of the Books. One of the more interesting things about the Books first two records was their democratic production; the music never seems to push the listeners ear toward any one element. But now Zammuto's voice is clearly the focus, and though his quiet and half-spoken phrasing works well with the arrangements, the ""tunes,"" as such, don't necessarily warrant the added attention. It's as though, with a few exceptions, the Books weren't quite sure what they wanted to do and they wound up stuck halfway between proper songs and the ambiguity of samples. Though the Books do a nice job here bending lyrics to fit the open-ended tone of their compositional style, the original vocals wind up draining their sound of mystery, and Lost and Safe seems by far more conventional than their previous two records.","After two records of democratic production and sampled voices arranged inside compositions for sliced-and-diced guitar, banjo, and cello, the Books make vocals and song structures this LP's centerpiece.

Elevator,Hot Hot Heat,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a213d1975652138696/1:1/w_160/0b365da0.jpg,2005-04-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3929-elevator/,Sire,"No, I don't regret it: When I endorsed Hot Hot Heat's Make Up the Breakdown, I knew damn well I probably wasn't betting on a long-distance horse. After completing the review, I went on full media blackout from Hot Hot Heat, because what I knew about this band I did not like. Their pre-fame album, Scenes One Through Thirteen, was auspiciously crude; their live show, reportedly excruciating. But despite my qualms, I couldn't stop listening to Make Up the Breakdown. Though they drew from the same new wave well as a lot of this young century's other hot prospects, Hot Hot Heat seemed to have a lot more flair and energy...and not coincidentally, a lot more Dexy's. Chock full of sugar-high keyboards, English-major alliterations, and singer Steve Bays' chutes-and-ladders voice, Make Up had an exuberance that made even its self-mutilation single a dancefloor staple for people who aren't dancefloor staples. Ever since Make Up's release, however, Hot Hot Heat have apparently been trying their damnedest to bump Interpol off the cover of the Post-Fame Jinx Handbook. Make the hasty leap to a major label? Check. Lose a key member to creative differences during second album's recording? Check (guitarist Dante Decaro). Delay follow-up album until all or most of the buzz generated by the debut has dissipated? Check plus. The chorus cries ""backlash,"" but to paraphrase the golden oldie, just because we're backlashing doesn't mean we're wrong. It's unfortunate that what leaves me cold about Elevator are complaints levied in knee-jerk style to indie bands promoted to the big leagues, but that doesn't make the album's failings any less true: Hot Hot Heat sound like they're playing scared and playing it safe, and in doing so fall through the cracks between their established fans and their imagined ones. A listener can pick up on this fear just from instrumentation alone, which-- given the departure of Decaro-- veers surprisingly away from Mays' spastic synthesizer and towards the safe confines of guitar-based rock. Elevator also muzzles what was a respectable rhythm section relative to the world of indie rock, one that believably swung through white-boy reggae (""Bandages""), white-boy Latin (""Talk to Me, Dance with Me""), and other white-boy takes on international flavors. Elevator sticks to largely straight-ahead pounding, ""Shame On You"" providing the sole remnant of these charmingly earnest attempts at flicking off 4/4 time. Also abandoned back at Sub Pop is the coy wordplay, with only the half-hearted ""You Owe Me an IOU"" reflecting the infectiously nerdy winking of Bays' past lyrics. Instead, Elevator (itself a title that seems destined for bargain-bin files) contains a slew of public-domain-bland song names that reflect the lack of imagination within: ""Ladies and Gentleman"" we are ""Running Out of Time"" in the ""Middle of Nowhere"". Fittingly, most of these tracks sound groomed for immediate slotting into television montages comedy end-credits-- especially ""Pickin' It Up"", which sounds not unlike the theme to ""Friends"". There are a few pleasant exceptions-- most notably ""Island of the Honest Man"". With a few abrupt tempo changes, some melodious bass and noisy guitar sheets, and a bridge that does a reasonable approximation of Brainiac, this song really is an island of Hot Hot Heat's previous promise, taking all their new-wave primary sources and just blazing through them in a caffeine furor. It's enough to remind me that I really, honestly, do not want a band like Hot Hot Heat to fail-- I know you're thinking, ""hey look, it's the good old Pitchfork build 'em up and knock 'em down routine,"" and the thought hurts. Backlash continues to be the primary fuel source of indie scenery, and due to its omnipotence everything gets confusing and complicated when a band really does fall down the well of follow-up album expectations. Anyway, you'll just have to trust me when I say that Elevator isn't the victim of political bias, it's just disappointing, an effort that finds Hot Hot Heat in a piss-poor dead heat with late-coming doppelgangers the Bravery...the Crisp Rice to HHH's Rice Krispies. I may be skeptical of Hot Hot Heat's youth and style to the point of allergy, but things would've been much simpler-- and I would've been a much happier listener-- if they'd just lived up to their promise, rather than fulfilled my suspicions.","On their Sire debut, Hot Hot Heat disappointingly sound like they're playing scared and playing it safe, falling through the cracks between their established fans and their imagined ones.

Icelandic-Italian songstress Emiliana Torrini is far more than that: Her ululations over the credits to The Two Towers made old Gollum sound like, oops, Björk-- who, now that you mention it, was offered the job first (and said ""xF6""). Anyway, Torrini's debut, Love in the Time of Science, was totally more of a Portishead rip. Like, hey, Beth Gibbons from Portishead, Torrini has since ditched the electronic accoutrements for subdued, ostensibly trend-proof Euro-folk. Listen, I'm as tired of Nick Drake comparisons as the next jaded rock typist, but on her latest album, Fisherman's Woman, Torrini dons Drake's hushed legacy as eagerly as she recently wore third-hand beats and Thievery Corporation guest spots. Pensive lead track ""Nothing Brings Me Down"" starts with a droning, finger-picked acoustic guitar figure, handled capably by producer/collaborator Mr. Dan, and peaks at a soaring wordless vocal straight out of ""Cello Song"". Bass and gentle percussion eventually shuffle in, establishing a spare framework that rarely deviates for the next 11 tracks. A monochrome palette, sure, but when it works it works. For Torrini that's on first single ""Sunny Road"", an aching acoustic-pop love letter with a melody well-suited for Torrini's pleasant voice-- which, by the by, definitely brings to mind Sweden's Stina Nordenstam, second, and fellow folk pixie Joanna Newsom, third, after you-know-who (not Drake). Lyrics aren't Torrini's strongest suit, but she acquits herself well on the catchy ""Heartstopper"", another gossamer number about soul-searching ""with number three still on my plate."" Torrini's double-tracked harmonies and Dan's supple guitar line on closer ""Serenade"", another highlight, could have come from Wednesday Morning, 3AM-era Simon and Garfunkel, whose ""Sound of Silence"" Torrini once covered. Unfortunately, Fisherman's Woman doesn't always work, and its infrequent variations-- accordions and nautical creaking on the otherwise forgettable ""Lifesaver"", piano instead of guitar on the title track-- do little to disguise songs that can be as ephemeral as Torrini's voice. Fine, she's not just a Björk knock-off. Full credit, also, for penning the Kylie Minogue hit ""Slow"". But Torrini's folk-pop dalliance is as innocuously suited for health spas and pottery classes as any trip-hop relic.","Latest record from the Icelandic-Italian songstress.

The group began as a one-man project, with Shai Halperin doing all the writing, playing, and singing. After one album, 2000's Meet Yr Acres, he kicked the jack-of-all-trades route to the curb, got himself a band, and made a quick metamorphosis into a brash rocker. The full-band edition of the Capitol Years put together a hugely entertaining live show and released the rollicking Jewelry Store EP in 2002. An archival release put the solo act to bed, and now they've dropped the first full-band Capitol Years LP, Let Them Drink. The record doesn't want you to just kick back and listen, preferring to taunt you from your chair via head-nodding blues punch-ups and brawling rock'n'roll. In their new, rougher state, the Capitol Years play with a lot of brash bravado, but they're not beyond a good three-part harmony or a strange song structure that, for instance, kicks into sudden overdrive at the end of the chorus. It's not all rock either, with songs like the title track eschewing drums and relying instead on insistently strummed acoustic guitar for momentum. The song's vocal melody see-saws over a simple chord progression, backed by full, rich harmonies. Of course, the songs on either side of it are amped-up strutters, with ""Everyone Is a Skunk"" flying through about four different sections that could each be the chorus and ""Ramona"" flirting with undulating ""Suzie Q"" guitar riffs before twisting into a pummeling raver. ""Giant Drunks"" plays the best blues card, with a crawling beat, thick bassline, and chunky guitar riffs in the verse and breathy harmonies on the refrain. The only place where it doesn't really work is unfortunately also the longest song, ""Nothing to Say"" (unfortunate title, too, come to think of it). It wants desperately to rock like there's no tomorrow, but the band holds back and then holds back some more and finally lets it die without having lived first. The sleigh-bell rock of ""Lucky"" closes the LP and nicely redeems it, ending this entertaining, varied rock record on a high note.","The first full-band LP from the Shai Halperin-led group is rougher than its predecessor.

Oak or Rock,Phonophani,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19113d1975652138678/1:1/w_160/ff10ad8b.jpg,2005-04-03 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6567-oak-or-rock/,Rune Grammofon,"Norwegian Espen Sommer Eide, one half of Alog, works solo as Phonophani. Oak or Rock is his third record and second for Rune Grammofon (his first was released on Tromsø homeboy Geir Jenssen's Biophon label). Alog combine software-based sounds with acoustic instruments, some treated, some left alone; as Phonophani, Eide works with the same elements but in different proportions. Oak or Rock is more purely electronic than the most recent Alog record, with a particular emphasis on the bleeps that have been associated with number-crunching computers ever since fridge-sized, reel-to-reel consoles were dressing sci-fi movie sets. The dominance of bleeps on Oak or Rock makes the appearance of sounds from the physical world that much more striking. It all works, but you can't help but think about the conflict between the various sources and their immediate associations. So the groaning cello on ""Take Off Your Wooden Coat"" is more mournful when surrounded by the gurgling computer noises, a swaying signpost of music tradition struggling to stand upright in the digital rain. ""You Must Welcome the Stranger"" also incorporates cello but abstracted vocal samples dominate. The rush of syllables are impossible to place, whether they come from songs or finely chopped speech, but the cumulative herky-jerky effect is something like flipping through a book of animation, sensing movement in the layers of images until your thumb sticks and you're left with a crudely drawn still. A few tracks delight in finding leaks between the digital/acoustic divide. ""The Boiling Fjords Orchestra"" splits the difference between the worlds, stretching the drone of strings until it acquires a sparkling metallic sheen, but the best track on the record is ""Cloudberry"", a collaboration with vocalist Maja Ratkje. She's a natural for this sort of between-the-spaces world, sounding like a bionic Meredith Monk floating above the rhythmic bed of static. Her chirps, coos, and melodic croons blend easily with the electronic tones and it's sometimes difficult to tell where her voice leaves off and the processing begins. When the computer takes over completely on Oak or Rock (""Earth Diver"", ""The Melancholic Giant""), the results are merely interesting, worth following for the off-the-grid unpredictability but failing to engage on a textural level. But these so-so lulls, constituting roughly half the record, are easier to ride out knowing an amazing little track is just around the corner.","Solo effort on Rune Grammofon from Espen Sommer Eide, one half of Alog.

Who's Your New Professor?,Sam Prekop,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11c5e6ef959693200fa/1:1/w_160/83949153.gif,2005-04-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6456-whos-your-new-professor/,Thrill Jockey,"Of all the records produced in Chicago in the late 90s, the Sea and Cake's were the comfiest. As for singer Sam Prekop's solo album, well: His was just the best. The people involved were the same guys as always-- O'Rourke, McEntire, Taylor, Abrams, Mazurek-- but something about Prekop made all the difference. Part of it was his hushed, husky ""soul"" singing, still the perfect accompaniment to that Chicago-style fake bossa nova. But the bulk of it was just the quiet lull of the thing-- the way half of its tracks laid back into spare, comfy sounds and let them drift along. Which made it a little strange to anticipate this album: How do you follow up something that seemed so much like a happy accident, or a gorgeous, quiet side-note? Because with this set, Prekop's putting a lot more into it: There are more ""proper"" songs and less airy instrumental pieces, and in spots those laid-back soul inclinations bloom into something you could stretch toward calling funky. What stays true, though, is that sound-- soft, simple, and natural, the surprisingly un-slick tones of raw instruments in a big room. It has a little do with Jim O'Rourke's ""pop"" records (Eureka, Halfway to a Threeway), and a little to do with the Sea and Cake, but neither reference quite gets the particulars: What Prekop's playing is some form of half-jazzy bossa nova soul, some elegant laid-back concoction that's part beach and part dinner party. The rhythm section skips along in a loose shuffle, Prekop touches softly at his guitar in that electric bossa style, and his breathy croon winds the melody in and out of the occasional low swell of horns. The results can range from blissfully cushy to outright grand, thanks to their impeccable composition. Forget the details: The sheer comfort of this stuff can charm just about anyone, from the rock bar to the office to your grandma's house. The timing couldn't be better, either, because it's difficult to separate the sound from the city. In L.A., you can get this kind of sunset white-guy soul any time; in Chicago, spring really means something, and there's no better use for this music than getting massively chilled-out in your big, suddenly-sunny apartment. Better still, this is anything but mood music: Prekop is a songwriter to be reckoned with, and the dynamics and arrangements on this disc have a depth that keeps luring you further in. Just like bossa nova-- its hot-bath laziness and lively, complex instrumental interplay, both somehow occupying the exact same space. So I keep listening, and sorting through all that graceful composition, and dreaming of biking up Ashland in June. Up until now, Prekop's solo work has been the side-note in the Sea and Cake diaspora, that one album flying well below the radar of Archer Prewitt's singer-songwriter career. Hopefully this set will change that: Prewitt may be cuter, but Prekop's sound is the real marvel.","The Chicago mainstay's latest solo LP features the usual suspects, but contains fewer airy instrumentals than usual.

Metamorphosis: Ghost Chronicles 1984-2004,Ghost,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf1beb335119a49ed180/1:1/w_160/af47b1b4.gif,2005-03-31 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3441-metamorphosis-ghost-chronicles-1984-2004/,Drag City,"Early last year-- as part of their regular ""Invisible Jukebox"" department-- The Wire played Damon and Naomi an early piece featuring the duo's frequent collaborator, Ghost guitarist Michio Kurihara. ""I can't believe he was doing this in '88,"" said Damon. ""And here we all were in our indie rock bands and we didn't know."" Looking back, it's safe to say that hardly anybody outside of Japan had much inkling of what Masaki Batoh and his fellow mystics in Ghost were getting up to in the late 1980s. Nor could anyone have easily predicted what a psych-folk, prog-rock colossus the group would someday become. With their origins in guerrilla street performance and ritualistic collective improvisations staged at various Tokyo-area temples, the band's formative years seemed destined to remain in the shadows. Thankfully, however, that impression has changed with the release of Metamorphosis, Drag City's astonishing new collection of Ghost audio and video rarities. Packed with more than an hour of previously unheard music and nearly two hours of unearthed video documents, Metamorphosis contains footage from virtually every chapter of the group's existence. And though its appeal will likely be exclusively limited to those already familiar with Ghost's inspired majesty, for the avid fan this set might possibly seem too good to be true. Comprised entirely of material dating from the years 1987-89, the CD portion of Metamorphosis showcases various early versions of Ghost as they ambitiously cast their sound about, quite audibly seeking to test their limits and capabilities. Centered around the steadfast core of charismatic leader Batoh and multi-instrumentalists Taishi Takizawa and Kazuo Ogino, the music created by these pre-Kurihara editions of the band often bears little resemblance to rock, and on the pieces collected here Ghost instead forge a potent, captivating blend of free jazz, acid folk, and traditional Japanese sounds. It's difficult to guess what might've been informing the group's material of this era-- particularly since at points here these guys seem just a step or two removed from subsisting on twigs and lichen. But several of these improvised tracks consider the same fiery trails lit by such previous explorers as AMM or free players from the classic BYG label roster. Meanwhile, the 1988 outtake ""Blood Red River"" finds Batoh emoting over some bent dustbowl blues in a strange, low-pitched drawl that manages to evoke Skip Spence. As fascinating as most of this embryonic music on the CD is, it's Metamorphosis' DVD presentation that contains most of this collection's true revelations. Featuring an abundance of live footage from various Ghost incarnations in a wide variety of venues, this disc provides a relatively succinct visual record of the group's timeline. Though much of this video is of rather shaky quality- most of the clips feature the erratic sound, dim lighting and stationary cameras that U.S. viewers might associate with cable access programming- this is made up for by the fact that this material exists at all and we actually get to watch it. This video collection is rife with highlights, starting with the earliest clip from 1984 which features a skinny, shirtless Batoh staging a noisy one-man demonstration in front of Tokyo's Chinese embassy to protest the occupation of Tibet. Other gems include a dynamite set of acoustic material recorded in a wooden Jesuit church in 1993 (the band billed itself as a ""medieval music club"" to get permission to play) a couple raucous tracks from 2002's Terrastock Festival in Boston, and an extended segment of more recent material performed at a 2004 Tokyo concert. Another bonus video not to be missed is of a wild 1988 group performance in a busy Tokyo train station, showcasing Batoh and Ogino in full free-form wail as bemused commuters file past. As with all the best of Metamorphosis' delights, the piece fills the viewer with immense appreciation for Ghost's haunting alien magic, and also spurs the hope that somewhere right this instant-- be it in Tokyo, Helsinki, Sao Paulo, or in your own town- another such collection of enlightened players are kicking up their own similarly beautiful racket.","This CD/DVD package collects early tracks and extensive video of the psych-folk, prog-rock band.

Raydoncong 2005,Mahjongg,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35369fc7814a47cd603/1:1/w_160/172bf33a.jpg,2005-03-31 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5643-raydoncong-2005/,Cold Crush,"Whether you choose to view life as an absurdly cruel, chaotic string of events or a profound struggle to satiate a benevolent troll at the earth's core, the coincidence is a gem of the human comedy. Whatever or Whoever brought the releases of M.I.A's Arular and Mahjongg's Raydoncong 2005 together on the same date, I would like to thank Him/Her or The Void. On the one hand, you have an absurdly hyped, burgeoning pop star who strikes rebel poses and affects scenester fashion and vernacular. On the other, you have Mahjongg, smartass Chicago art-punks with an Africa 70 fetish. So? Yeah, so their album covers look identical. Half-full Scenario: Bloggers, trend riders, fashion rebels, and people who want to own the ""Album of the Year"" descend on record stores nationwide, clearing the shelves of Arular in a rabid frenzy that makes the Cabbage Patch Riots of XMAS '85 look like a boxful of kittens. As the mob moves from store to store, devouring all in its path, those left behind wander the aisles in a bloody daze. Through the blur of a punctured cornea, they see the cover of Raydoncong. AK-47s, ethnic people, colors, pretty colors. Arular stash, whut gwan! And the concussee contingent becomes Mahjongg's motherlode. Half-empty Scenario: People calmly sashay into record stores to the ""new release"" shelves, holding hands, two by two. As they peruse for Arular, one reaches for Raydoncong. ""No, not that one, silly!"" says the other. ""Haha, my bad! I saw banana clips and, well, you know."" M.I.A. 1, Mahjongg 0. Before you get all spazzy, I realize that album covers have little to do with the worth of an album. But fate has drawn these two together, however tenuously, and the contrast goes beyond the images on the cover. Where the lovely Sri Lankan is being praised/maligned for her earnest/misguided injection of personal politics into pop music, Mahjongg have apparently decided to go whole hog and appoint themselves impromptu Western mouthpiece for the Congolese opposition. How's that for self-serving appropriation? Their website is a bewildering mélange of anti-fascist propaganda and record reviews from The Village Voice and Washington Post. Then again, the rants against President Sassou-Nguesso are in French, so maybe Mahjongg just worked out a bandwidth timeshare with the Conseil National de la Résistance Brazzaville Chapter. It's all quite confusing, I assure you, but somehow Mahjongg's peculiar agit prop accurately visualizes their sonic delivery of junkyard afro-new wave. Sub-genre Alert! Building on the jittery punk-funk of their Machinegong EP, Raydongcong 2005 slaps together 46 minutes of beat-heavy agitation and organized chaos. There is so much overlapping clatter, it sometimes sounds like backstage at a battle of the bands, with everyone eventually falling into tune through proximity. Nearly every song contains multiple vocals, tempo shifts, guitars jabbing into strings over electronic bleeps, and radio dispatches plus a drum machine not to mention synths in addition to pots and pans and sticks and feedback and possibly a horse. Actually, ""The Stubborn Horse"" is a lazy nag which unpleasantly puts a Sheryl Crow song on the tip of your tongue, but Mahjongg makes up for that gaff. As ""Aluminum"" was to Machinegong, ""The Rrabbitt"" is the standout oddity on Raydoncong. It's a song that sounds like nothing else on the album or much else at all. Equal parts Fela Kuti and Devo, it could sweat out a dancehall quicker than you could say ""Ba-na-na."" Sporting a hypersonic cowbell, percussive guitar scratches, a bounding bassline, and the falsetto nonsense requisite to any proper dance number, old timers might want to tape up their pelvises for this one. As with M.I.A., Mahjongg's political gesturing ends up a mere distraction at the end because they find a way to shake your can. Mahjongg's version may not be as cutting edge, but it's effective. Now, if they could duplicate ""The Rrabbitt"" a dozen times per album, young Maya would be in deep shit.","Beat-heavy agitation, organized chaos, and political gestures color Mahjongg's latest release.

Live at Earls Court,Morrissey,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c7c0084474cd0c3549/1:1/w_160/80e6a706.jpg,2005-03-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5438-live-at-earls-court/,SanctuaryAttack,"God bless Morrissey for spinning his comeback LP into a gift reissue (the same cover photo but on silver!), several singles, four EPs, a live CD, and a DVD-- and stopping there. After all, if the man so wished, he could compile a full-length tour video entirely from instances of people jumping onstage to hump him. Morrissey's 2004 post-You Are the Quarry victory lap unfolded in the atmosphere of ripe, obscenely pulsing global adulation; at least three people were ejected before my eyes from the Radio City Music Hall for attempting to mate with the star mid-song. Tempting as it is to approach Live at Earls Court as another cash-in, the moment it captures is indeed somewhat phenomenal. It certainly bears documenting. Morrissey's moving into an interesting and barely explored territory here: throughout Live at Earls Court (in fact recorded piecemeal in London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Brighton, and Dublin), he is a pre-rock crooner commanding Beatle-level hysteria; a smooth, urbane party host backed onstage by anonymous young chord-bashers. He's grown distinctly comfy around the old hits-- or as comfy as one could possibly be in that jagged terrain (his Smiths-era vocal lines careen against the chord progressions in astonishingly counterintuitive ways)-- and the recent songs appear to have been written with a new vocal prowess in mind: Witness the huge Broadway highs of ""I Have Forgiven Jesus"" and ""You Know I Couldn't Last"". Indeed, Morrissey's singing appears to have taken a giant leap over the past seven years or so. Listening to the newly velvety Moz tackle ""How Soon Is Now"" (a ballsy choice for the disc's opener) is a pleasure of an entirely confusing sort: the song is still a roaring, lurching Grendel, all rage and laser tremolo, but the listener can't help feeling luxuriously entertained. The frustration, the urgency, the hormonal madness of the original are politely disinvited; that stuff is, after all, a bit infantile. Morrissey may well be the world's first rock star to fashion a successful shtick out of enthusiastically embracing middle age. For the record, middle age does become him. That face, oddly enough, is hitting the iconic stage just now, with the crow's feet and a bit of sag in the jowls, and the Yves Saint Laurent shirts feel a little more warranted. Mainly, the years allow Morrissey to sidestep direct sexuality in a whole new way: Hilarious as it is for me to type this, he's become emphatically paternal, in a flirty who's-yer-Daddy way. The uproarious chorus of the B-side ""Don't Make Fun Of Daddy's Voice"" (""....because he can't help it/ When he was a teenage boy/ Something got stuck in his throat"") attests to this directly-- but a fatherly, bemused benevolence rears its head elsewhere (""First Of The Gang To Die,"" for instance, is full of it). At the same time, it is now harder than ever to imagine Morrissey settling into a Bacharachian loungy twilight-- not after the controlled squall of ""Irish Blood, English Heart"", the loudest, most pissed-off, and most direct song of his career. Plus, now it's Joan of Arc's iPod that melts in ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"", not a Walkman, so the kids will still know what Daddy's on about, at least for a while. And then, I guess we can just keep changing the device.","Like a victory lap after his successful comeback, this CD nicely showcases Morrissey's weathered croon and iconic presence.

""Who Are You"", ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", ""Baba O'Riley""-- as themes for CBS' ""CSI"" franchise the songs are meaty enough and beaty enough to match David Caruso's ego, while being big enough to hook baby boomers into Tivoing the clunky procedural crime dramas. Someday a CBS! Miniseries! Event! will unite the three ""CSI"" casts in an epic struggle against GSR residue and Dan Cortese's career as a character actor, and its theme song will be the 10-minute Tommy epic ""Underture"". When that happens, the Who will have reached Kravitzian levels of licensing overexposure. But in the meantime we can still enjoy the band's music for its strong points-- thundering power chords, machismo blending with naughty British schoolboy humor, ambitious flights of pop songwriting, and a conceptual scope that was as enviable as it was flawed. All of that's wrapped up in Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out, the Los Angeles singer's a capella interpretation of the Who's 1967 album. Haden recreates the entire record with only her voice and an eight-track recorder, from the flatulent trumpets and ""What's for tea, darling?"" drop-ins of fake advert ""Heinz Baked Beans"" to the swirling psych-rock of classic rock radio staple ""I Can See for Miles"". On the latter her harmonic selves suggest a Mellotron while she sings the lead in a voice that's clear and bright, but also a little deadpan. And that wryness is important for Haden, because it's both a connection to and a departure from her primary source. While Who Sell Out was a gleeful lambaste of advertising and radio, it also featured some really strong songs. Haden understands both aspects, but knows she can't retell it accurately with her limited materials. So she doesn't. She uses suggestion instead, and a fan's emulation, and her own sense of humor, too; she makes something that loves its predecessor but has no intention of resembling it exactly. And at that, the baby boomers and rockists breathed a little easier. As the story goes, Mike Watt put Haden up to this project in the first place. She'd already done an a capella record-- 1996's fanciful Imaginaryland-- and Watt wondered what she might do with one of his favorites. There's no purism in that backstory. Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out is just a fun exercise, the work of a daydreaming geek girl who sings like an angel and makes cool guitar noises with her mouth. Its casual ""Why not?""-ness is its greatest strength. But there's attention to detail here, too. ""Face the music with Odorono"", the original Sell Out's fake ad copy smirked beneath a shot of Townshend mugging with an enormous can of the stuff. ""The all-day deodorant that turns perspiration into inspiration!"" But at the same time, the actual song ""Odorono"" exemplified the songwriter's emerging flair for epic pop. Haden has fun recreating the album art, and the songs on Sell Out, too. Of course, since she's the only instrument, this is done with lots of layers and a general knack for hitting the sweet spot of Pete's famous fanfares.

Yeah, they started off faultless; the strobe-light electro on their early singles was so precise that you had to assume they knew exactly what they were doing. But then comes their first LP, and geez: Suddenly they're playing shabby bass lines, the drum machine's booming from some corner of a crappy basement, and the whole shrill thing sounds as much like an art-school trainwreck as a sneaky reinvention. A single like ""Don't You Stop"" could reassure you that they were bringing it all back home to their strong suit, but then here we are with the D.U.M.E. EP, about which let's say this: It's certainly the logical extension of that full-length. The upshot of these six tracks seems to be that Adult. have been listening to a hell of a lot of Bauhaus. And I have to give them credit: They've followed that impulse right out to the sweet spot. Because every time I think they've finally spun off into some dippy little world that I don't need to visit, they manage to pull me back onto their side. The shrieky basement goth on D.U.M.E. seems at first like a pretty cringeworthy development, even if you go for this kind of thing; you sort of want to let Nicola Kuperus know that yelpy witch vocals (half Peter Murphy, half Patti Smith) might not be her calling, or tell Adam Lee Miller he's better with discfloor programming than weird muddy stomps. But give it a few spins, and it starts to seem pretty useful: Who else these days is going to turn your bedroom into a bat cave? Everyone pillages the Reagan era, but who's willing to sound like a pack of raccoon-eyed art-school freaks from 1984? The sound is shrill and ridiculous, sure, but here's the half-remembered secret with this kind of stuff: No matter how self-important it may have sounded, being shrill and ridiculous was half the fun. You don't sing along with ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" for its deep spiritual qualities; you just enjoy making the faces and doing the voice, and you're probably laughing while you're at it. That's pretty much what's on offer here and Adult., as always, have a knack for embarrassing themselves in a good way. The propulsive drum programming on ""Hold Your Breath"" turns it into pogo cheerleading goth, or some vampire version of the B-52s; go-go bounce and weirdo yelping both make like the dark side of ""Rock Lobster"". The rest is a bit more of a pileup, but the bass crawl on the title track sounds like the earliest, creepiest version of the Cocteau Twins, and I'm a sucker for the Bauhaus-replica guitar that crops up everywhere else. It's a mess, as usual, but this band has a terrific excuse: So long as no one else is willing to go quite this far out on a limb, it's not like you can say some other group is doing it better. Here's hoping they've got more high-energy sneering for their next full length, because when they're really rocking this stuff, it's a whole lot more fun than anything else on the rack.","I've gotta hand it to Adult.: They're more willing than most to follow their muse into potentially embarrassing ...

Their solution? Pump up frontman Kelly Jones' vocals, hire Argentinean drummer Javier Weyler, cut the sentimental shit, and get back to the beer-stained, pool-cue-wavin', leather-studded cock-rock roots of the late-90s 'Phonics album Britain drooled over. As the album title points out, Jones' lyrics deal with a motley cast of characters, all of which grounded in the basest barroom debauchery. The title character of opener ""Superman"" is drunk, plays poker, and wants to ditch Lois Lane for a ""teenage blonde."" Jones vents some sibling animosity on ""Brother"" by, well, beating up his brother. ""Girl"" is about fucking a girl. The whole bad boy bit gets pretty boring pretty fast, with Jones appearing especially ridiculous on ""Doorman"", a four-minute ""fuck you"" to some security guard he brawled with during a 2004 Seattle show: ""You look like a monkey scowling at me/ Well suck my banana, suck it with cream"". The biggest joke of the album, though, is the group's shameless appeal to today's new wave hipsters. Single ""Dakota"" is the big culprit here, with its high-school romanticism and sugary synth workings. Jones pines for summer nights and adolescent innocence until his emotions boil over into the not-so-immortal line: ""You made me feel like the one."" There they mimic New Order; elsewhere, the basslines of ""Superman"" and ""Deadhead"" rip off the Cure's ""A Forest"", while ""Lolita"" is the Stereophonics' ill-advised, half-assed stab at shoegazer. This unctuous new wave dabbling is the only departure from the album's otherwise humdrum Stereophonics sound. Jones still croaks out songs with that wretched voice of his, an amalgam of nicotine, alcohol and AOR. The guitars still churn out feeble riffs more appropriate for a Hot Wheels commercial than a grown-up's rock album, and even when they're on to something it feels like they're only fumbling with a good idea. It's Britain's cancerous version of Creed, Guns N' Roses, and Stone Temple Pilots rolled into one, though unfortunately lacking those bands' self-destructive tendencies.

Worse still when once you learn that it's just a mere alias for some moody, does-it-all indie-rock guy named Craig Gurwich. The moniker is too long and the alliteration involved makes it hard to say even two times fast. You could shorten it to Shatter Creek but that would be like moving from the heart of Bad Band Name City to the seedy outskirts. But such quibbles would be moot if Gurwich's apparition-folk somehow rose above his fifth-rate Skeet Ulrich slasher-flick handle on his second full-length. No such luck. Mired in empty waves of echo and sleepy-time acoustic-slosh arrangements, the singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer matches the crushing boredom of his nickname as he listlessly indulges in his own banal depressions throughout much of All the Answers. ""I used to be optimistic,"" croons the California man in a lofty, angelic way that recalls a seriously NyQuil-ed Jim James of My Morning Jacket, ""But I can't lie/ All I see is the dying of the earth, junk piles of trash and disease."" Well, ok! If ""Optimistic"" was some kind of post-modern, post-liberal, self-reflexive take on overbearing pessimism, it could be worth a single tear. But as is, its downtrodden lyrical bluntness and airy atmospherics waft and sway without much impact. The song's noisy and dissonant outro is a welcome respite from the flat haze, too bad such restless moments are disappointingly rare. Gurwich's chief strength is his voice and, as producer, the multi-tracked harmonies he creates with it. Delicate and pretty, his vulnerable wail connects on the few backwoods ballads that offer a pulse, weak as it may be. The album's title track offers an appealing, slow-motion melody with the singer finding a comfort in the naive helplessness of his own trembling delivery. Still, such helplessness easily turns into a pathetic desperation with lines like, ""You should pay more attention to me."" Back-to-back insomnia cures ""You Don't Have to Be Perfect to Be Loved"" and ""Rebecca"" mark the record's crusty-eyed lowpoint. The former lulls with the requisite finger-pick strum and whisper vox along with a Legend of Zelda-esque whistle refrain; while listening, I half expected gnome-y old-timers to walk out of my closest, do a lame dance around my bed and tumble to the floor. With lyrics like, ""You were so young and pretty/ You were something else, yeah/ But you never felt quite pretty,"" the latter's twinkly-piano-propelled analysis of a young woman will make you long for the edgy insightfulness of Norah Jones. Maybe the Craigster should learn to divvy out his many responsibilities (he also designed the album's artwork!) in a more appropriate manner for his next project because this one-man-band thing isn't doing much for my ears or, based on the record's dour words, his personal life. Get some friends. Find a nice girl. Plug in the guitar every once and a while. None of us have All the Answers, but we can usually muster up a couple good ones when prodded.","Summer at Shatter Creek is an awful name for a band. Worse still when once you learn that it's ...

Early,Scritti Politti,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a4ea9e61561daa53ed/1:1/w_160/f2b36fa8.jpg,2005-03-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7806-early/,Sanctuary,"So this is what happens when you combine Marxism, art school, and post-punk London, 1979: A rickety, alien pulse, as made by a band that insisted on printing the production costs of every single on the sleeve. Scritti Politti may have spent the height of their career as the 80s' wooziest, most dubbed-out synth-soul act\xD1but they started miles and miles away from that, and this Rough Trade compilation of their early work can nearly break your brain. Singer Green Gartside even goes as far as adding an over-apologetic note to the package, calling its contents ""structurally unsound"" and ""a bit winceworthy"" and hoping you'll at least find it ""interesting."" And geez, Green: How could anyone not? Because while Scritti appear here as a classic bass/drums/guitar trio, the music they're making is relentlessly mindbending. The early cuts aren't so much ""songs"" as they are tipsy Frankensteins that lurch slowly along for a few yards before falling down again. The bizarro scratching patterns of Gartside's guitar aren't so out-of-bounds for post-punk, but the way they mesh with Nial Jinks's lazy, dubby bass might be-- and the shifting tick-tock rhythms of the drums serve the exact opposite purpose of an anchor. As far as post-punk goes, it's as disorientingly ""difficult"" as anything the Pop Group ever did, and those guys were trying to be difficult. Scritti, on the other hand, start off sounding like they've only every heard three records-- by the Heartbreakers, King Tubby, and Aretha Franklin-- and they're just making everything else up. Weirdest of all is the recognition that this is a pop band waiting to happen: All around the alien, seemingly random patterns they stumble through, Gartside keeps lapsing into sweet soul crooning, or steering the whole thing into the brief, sudden semblance of order. (They do know some chords!) The beauty of this collection is hearing how the off-balance clatter draws itself up into something so singular. By ""Bibbly-O-Tek"" they're scratching their way through a beautiful babble, and by ""Doubt Beat"" they've firmed up into something that could reasonably claim to have a ""chord sequence."" And yet in both cases, it feels just as uniquely off-kilter as it did before. At the end of this set, you get the biggest transition of all: An absolutely incredible single called ""The Sweetest Girl"". The impossible drumming is gone, replaced with the slow high-hat tick of a drum machine; the trebly guitar scratch is gone, replaced with Robert Wyatt on keyboards and a dub-appropriate synth-piano part. And suddenly this band is anything but skittery-- suddenly you're floating in a zero-graving soul number, a creamy make-out piece emerging from the post-punk basement. Gartside writes in his note that this music is ""evocative of extraordinary times,"" and it's in that transition that you feel it: A moment where rickety avant-dub could proceed without blinking into upscale soul and English funk. You can compare the first part to the Pop Group, or the Slits at their most outré; you can point out how often groups like XTC tried to tread on the second part (see Oranges and Lemons). But they're both big, big stretches: Most bands couldn't sound like this no matter how hard they tried.","How to go from Messthetics to sweetness in a few easy steps.

Let Us Never Speak of It Again,Out Hud,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba19c0084474cd0c277a/1:1/w_160/a28920f7.jpg,2005-03-30 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6060-let-us-never-speak-of-it-again/,Kranky,"I'm hardly old, and I can still remember a time when merely getting access to a four-track machine was considered a coup. Even if you managed to score one, no matter what you did with it, rock's nomenclature politely insisted that the best you could hope to make would be ""rough demos""-- those were the things that you'd use to convince a proper producer to make you sound good, in a proper studio, this time for real. Nowadays-- especially in the realm of music that can't be connected to Mutt Lange or David Foster in less than three steps-- the terms ""producer"" and ""musician"" mean increasingly little in relation to each other. Pirated software is everywhere, pre-amps are dirt-cheap, and a good mic and your buddy's sampler are only a phone call away. Have laptop, will dabble-- we all do, and we probably all have. I wonder if there's any connection between this relatively new shift and this decade's obvious affinity for collectives. If a band (in the most traditional sense of the word) has historically been about conveying a unified front, maybe a collective works more like a safety net, something there to frame and contain all of the different music coming out of it, providing all the social support of a band without any of the commitment. Of course, as we're slowly finding out, collectives have their drawbacks too, among which over-saturation by association ranks near the top of the list. With three of its five members also principle players in !!!, Out Hud's biggest challenge with this, their second record, would have been to shake off dance punk's residual baggage and make something that didn't sound like it was coming from within an echo chamber. On those terms-- and in fact, on pretty much any terms-- Let Us Never Speak of It Again is a huge success, a fresh-sounding record that doesn't feel too obviously indebted to anything that's come before it, much less like anything Out Hud have made before. A lot of that has to do with the singing of Out Hud's female constituency, drummer Phyllis Forbes and cellist Molly Schnick, whose vocal presence-- their first outside of a few moans into an echo machine on early single ""Guilty Party""-- ceases the Kranky band's flirtation with post-rock and moves them into more overtly pop terrain. Just as important to the makeover is Justin Vandervolgen's production, which exchanges the sprawling, jam-based guitar workouts of the band's prior material in favor of a punchier, springier, more electronic sound. In terms of sounds and timbres, a decent analog would be Mu, who riff on disco, dance, haunted house atmospherics, and cheap MIDI patches to similarly great effect. With its elastic snares, cheap pianos, and fluffy vocals, second track ""It's For You"" sets the tone for a much leaner album. Although Tyler Pope's distinctively robust guitar sounds creep into the mix every once and a while, Out Hud generally stick to a more plasticky, dance-informed palette; nowhere is that more pronounced than on the album centerpiece, the eight-minute ""The Song So Good They Named It Twice"". Comprising peeling synth lines, a rumbling bass kick and a flickering clap track, its maximalist builds are loosely informed by LCD Soundsystem's club-oriented tracks, which is no bad thing. Elsewhere, more song-oriented highlights include the lone guitar workout ""One Life To Leave"" and the wonderful ""How Long"", which begins on a lumbering cello line before dissolving into a gorgeous slice of digital pop. But really, the album is so well-paced and smartly assembled that to single out individual tracks feels counterintuitive; as light and as effervescent as anything I've heard this year, Let Us Never Speak of It Again bounds between sounds and styles as freely as the people who made it.","On their latest EP, Out Hud's female constituency, drummer Phyllis Forbes and cellist Molly Schnick, have a vocal presence, which ceases the Kranky band's flirtation with post-rock and moves it into more overtly pop terrain.

What We Must,Jaga Jazzist,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c013d197565213af17/1:1/w_160/57ffd432.jpg,2005-03-30 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4196-what-we-must/,Ninja TuneSmalltown Supersound,"I can't say whether or not Norwegian pop fans are smarter than their American counterparts, but Jaga Jazzist's commercial success in their native Norway suggests that they at least have sturdier attention spans. It's difficult to imagine a wordless fjord of post-rock, jazz fusion, ambient electronica, and outlying points cracking the hook-happy American charts, but that's just what the influential dectet's 2002 sophomore album The Stix did upon its release in Norway. Only Coldplay and Queens of the Stone Age separated it from the top slot. Even more outlandish is the idea of something like Jaga on America's compartmentalized commercial radio, but ""All I Know Is Tonight"", the first song on What We Must, is already in rotation in Norway. The track is nearly eight minutes of gentle pageantry: An echoing cavern of triumphant guitars and keys, the breathy song of wind and reed instruments, adroit percussion dancing concisely around the beat, and a beautifully barren middle section where a silvery, liquid guitar lead delicately contorts through distinct moods and colors before igniting in a series of minor explosions, more like sparklers than fireworks. On pop radio. For perspective, imagine tuning in to a major American station and hearing Nickelback fade into a Broken Social Scene instrumental. My mind! The members of Jaga Jazzist can be traced through various high-profile Scandinavian bands including Motorpsycho, Supersilent, and Shining, and if you're beginning to liken their role in the Norwegian art-pod to Godspeed's in Montreal's incestuous scene, you're on the right track. What We Must plays like Godspeed encased in ice, shorn of dissonance and tooth-grinding crescendos to reveal a purely melodic, understatedly majestic core. It's alternately narcotic and galvanizing, like Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's Virðulegu forsetar with a few more notes and lot more instruments, and its pleasures are many: ""Stardust Hotel"", a springy, reverb-drenched dream of flight; the sparse, fluid music-box jazz of ""For All You Happy People""; a chorus of angels with long brass horns straddling ""Oslo Skyline""; and the shapeshifting Apostle of Hustle-like cloud of voice-synths, bubbly drums and fleet vibes on ""I Have a Ghost Now What?"" Those of you who like your instrumental music to be fractured and shrouded might prefer the aforementioned Shining and write off Jaga as boring; the rest should find ample rewards in What We Must's effortless sonority and memorable arrangements. And if you're like me, you're dreaming of a gigantic antenna powerful enough to pick up radio signals from Norway.","Post-rock, jazz fusion, and ambient electronica blend together on the latest from this Norwegian band.

Neat Neat Neat: The Alternative Anthology,The Damned,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8919d034d5c69bf3a96/1:1/w_160/2d67b283.jpg,2005-03-29 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2155-neat-neat-neat-the-alternative-anthology/,Sanctuary,"I became acquainted with the quote-unquote-first band of British punk-- first to release a single, tour the U.S., etc.-- in the most decidedly un-punk way possible: selecting the excellent Light at the End of the Tunnel double-album anthology merely to fulfill BMG's exacting requisites. For a 13-year-old with no concept of the intricacies of gouging consumers on shipping charges, the deal was stellar; the Damned, however, were not-- not then, anyway. I didn't get the ridiculously theatrical melodrama of ""I Just Can't Be Happy Today"" or the smirking, jovial skewering of the British tourism industry in ""Lovely Money""; the Damned seemed noisy, insane, and-- the worst offender-- they used a keyboard, which, after a decade of all the ""Axel F"" I could handle, was a problem. I had flannel to wear, and I couldn't be bothered. So I listened once and forgot them for a year; when I finally returned, understanding suddenly bloomed from ignorance. If punk ever had an ideal of doing your own thing, breaking the rules, or any of the other liberating clichés it's been reduced to, the Damned embodied that for as long as any band could. They eschewed political poses and anti-authoritarian rants (except to piss off the mob once in a while) and just played whatever the hell they wanted and had some fun doing it. That's the true importance of the Damned, in a way that my retelling of the band's convoluted history could never convey. And maybe that-- the unexpected spark of life not present in so many other punk artifacts-- explains why the Damned continue to be relentlessly compiled. Adding the three-disc Neat Neat Neat anthology to an array of live and ""best of"" comps that greatly outnumber the band's seven proper studio recordings (not counting any latter-day reunion offal) is a tough sell. Neat Neat Neat fights for table scraps at an already glutted table, but is further hindered by the Damned's own sordid recording history. Because as great and vital as the Damned were, they produced a limited selection of truly unassailable material: the white-hot fireball of Damned Damned Damned and their psych-punk powerhouse Machine Gun Etiquette. The intervening, stagnant Music for Pleasure and their later descent in gothic kitsch leave far less salvageable material. Of all the comps, only the thorough Light at the End of the Tunnel managed to hit the necessary highs while making the band's lesser material stand up by comparison. Rather than include too little and join the multitudes of shallow, uneven also-rans, Neat Neat Neat errs on the side of overkill but simply can't justify its length. Still, credit where it's due: the Sanctuary comp misses none of the Damned's most important moments-- ""New Rose"", the blistering ""Love Song"" and ""Neat Neat Neat, and the brilliant, cocaine-fueled shot at the Beatles' ""Help"", to name a few-- while managing to pack in some extra quality as well. A couple of extra tracks from original lead guitarist Brian James' glory days, like the tongue-in-cheek lament of ""Fan Club"" or ""Born to Kill"", and some less-seen later-period gems such as the incomparable arrogance of ""I Think I'm Wonderful"" and ""Melody Lee"" are excellent inclusions. With the inexplicable exception of ""Plan 9 Channel 7"", virtually everything a casual Damned fan needs to hear is included. But oh, they include a lot more than that, sadly. Like the Damned themselves, Neat Neat Neat is guilty of not quitting while it's ahead. Stultifying inclusions like ""Your Eyes"", ""Billy Bad Breaks"", and ""Dozen Girls"" make the LP a chore. The Damned endure, first among equals as the unsung (well, less sung) heroes of British punk, and they do so because unlike those eventually caught in their own rhetoric or tied to stereotype (with their own bondage, no less), the Damned epitomized the mindless, directionless energy that kinda got punk rolling in the first place. Thorough or not, a Damned compilation may be chaotic, uneven, and head-scratchingly baffling, but it should never be a chore.","Three-disc anthology compiles the best from these UK punk pioneers.

How have you been feeling? -Better than ever man. I'm so healthy I can drink more than pregnant hookers in heat. I'm so ripped I can stick needles in my arms, then stick needles in my needles' arms.

In this case, that's a proudly sentimental compliment. Such dancers typically slap together bits of a dozen songs into a five-minute mix. There are no seamless pause-edits to keep the groove; you can actually hear the tape machine stopping and re-recording between each cut, and yet there is an odd pleasure in grooves that work against dancing. Venezia almost rarely keeps his attention on a beat, sample, or melody for more than a couple of bars-- it's prime listening for the attention-deficient, like lysergic cartoon music that evokes the ghosts of Looney Tunes composers Carl Stalling and Raymond Scott. ""Rad Girl Killy"" nails that effect with a zigzagging, rubber-band violin, all bludgeoned by crashing ""Amen"" breaks. Nothing ever seems settled on This Means Forever-- before a sound can dig in its heels, it's slashed apart by a new sonic idea. Bedroom musicians have exploited that premise for years, but Venezia unleashes a genuine trash-punk vibe. He often sings like Fugazi's Guy Picciotto paying his bills as a rollerdisco DJ struggling to coax people onto the dancefloor. The audience response could be the breakbeats that shatter his DJ booth's glass after a thousand hits. ""Wake the dead kids, one at a time!"" Venezia belts out on opener ""Shaken"" over broken-footed beats, before DSP work gags his vocals with an ether-dipped cloth midway through. ""Glassy Eyes"" thumps a groove barely held by twittering synths, while the stronger ""Rocker Party"" focuses on a testosterone-poisoned rhythm. Standouts are the Alec Empire-on-Nickelodeon funk of ""Never, Nah"", the oxygen-depleted dancefloor strut of ""Hushhushdance"", and the diced-up serenades of ""Dubbio"". Most striking is closer ""Tivoli Clinic (10.28.00)"", a fading Polaroid of a ballad with brass drones that simmer into oblivion-- a prime comedown after all that delirium.","This NYC laptop-punk finds breakcore's nasty anti-groove-- you can almost dance to it.

Waiting for the Sirens' Call,New Order,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e0c0084474cd0c3581/1:1/w_160/b85344e7.jpg,2005-03-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5769-waiting-for-the-sirens-call/,Reprise,"For a group of folks nearing the half-century mark, Get Ready was pretty damn good; but for New Order, that return-from-wherever effort was a bit meh. New Order's ""meh"" is often better than most group's ""hell yeah,"" but that doesn't disguise their shortcomings, and ""Who's Joe""-- the first track from New Order's latest album, Waiting for the Sirens' Call-- is a continuation of the underwhelming competence of the band's previous album. That track isn't as in love with the sound of space-age guitars as Get Ready, but it's still a three-minute song that's given an extra two minutes' worth of rope to turn stiff and tepid. Combine that with the unwarranted focus on Bernard Sumner and his lyrical stylings-- not often a main attraction for New Order (and for good reason)-- and I'm settling in for another reasonably competent, mildly underwhelming effort from a group that doesn't need to prove a damn thing to anyone. But then the second track, ""Hey Now What You Doing"", manages to make its five-minute length seem like half that. Credit the pronounced presence of that nifty Peter Hook basswork, or the pithier words Sumner spits (""You have the brightest future/ Writing songs on your computer""-- believe me, it sounds better in context), but this sounds more like a group that's doing the damn thing and not just coasting on their own coattails. And then the title track comes on, and it's this gorgeous effortless shimmering thing, mournful and ebullient all at once. And then the first single, ""Krafty"", with its synth flourishes and corny pop-perfect sentiment (""But out there the world is a beautiful place/ With mountains, lakes and the human race"") blows the doors wide open, and any trepidation I had regarding this record dies on the vine. In his review of Get Ready, Pitchfork's own Joe Tangari makes note of how much the album rocked, which is probably why it felt to me as if the group went astray. First and foremost, New Order is a pop band-- just ask Frente!-- and for them to try their hand at loud guitars and loud beats doesn't play to the group's strengths. Nor does such a maneuver do them any favors when compared to their contemporaries-- Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie made a guest appearance on Get Ready, which is fitting, since his group's XTRMNTR did what Get Ready attempted to do, only bigger, louder, and-- most importantly-- better. In comparison, Sirens' Call features the Scissor Sisters' Ana Matronic-- she gets a verse and a few background lines in ""Jetstream"", a chirpy, flippant track where ""you are my jetstream lover"" and a sense of laconic confidence out-Kylies Ms. Minogue at her own coy game. When it's firing on all cylinders, Sirens' Call offers manic pop thrills that either recall the group's heyday, or slyly recalls the noise made by other people that were touched by New Order-- dig that Ace of Base action in ""I Told You So"". The track lengths don't lend themselves to a tidy, hit-and-run pop experience, but they do offer a taste of what the inevitable extended dance remix would sound like. The one track that most conforms to the three-minute radio oligarchy is closer ""Working Overtime"". It's a garagey barn-burner, not too dissimilar to Get Ready single ""Crystal"". These track's placements on their respective albums are a telling sign of New Order's confidence level. ""Crystal"" was Get Ready's centerpiece and calling card, the document that was supposed to announce to the world that New Order Is Back and could ably play ball with the kids they fathered. In some sense, it was a capitulation by a group that had no need to capitulate. ""Working Overtime"" is an afterthought, a track that does what ""Crystal"" did with less pomp and exerted effort, announcing to all those aforementioned indebted groups that, oh by the way, they can write these sorts of songs in their sleep, and they can put them at the end of their records, because they don't need to play ball with the other kids. They invented the game. In other words, they're New Order. And you're not.","After a clumsy attempt at goth-tinged guitar-based rock, New Order enjoy a slight return to form by going back to what they do best-- create mournful and ebullient pop.

Yearlong,Keith Fullerton Whitman,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa259d034d5c69bf3db3/1:1/w_160/6e666db6.jpg,2005-03-29 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8663-yearlong/,Carpark,"In 2001-02, the iconoclastic experimental duo of Keith Fullerton Whitman and Greg Davis armed themselves with laptops and a bewildering array of sound files to undertake an ambitious (particularly by the standards of abstract electronic improvisation) world tour. Along the way they apparently recorded their every stray whirr and blip, and now-- after what must have been a mind-boggling editing process-- they've whittled nearly 18 hours of live audio footage down to the relatively succinct 45-minute compilation Yearlong. Due to this nomadic recording process, Whitman and Davis have understandably put little emphasis on continuity here, choosing instead to offer Yearlong as something of a representative cross-section of their various joint creations. This has resulted in a sampler with an astonishing constantly evolving pool of noises and textures, but one that unfortunately doesn't generate the momentum necessary for these pieces to cohere into a gratifying whole. As composers both Whitman and Davis possess a restless streak of invention, so it doesn't feel entirely accurate to label this album as a departure for either artist. Nevertheless, Yearlong consists predominantly of pieces that are considerably freer and more dissonant than what I've previously associated with either performer. Thanks to their chosen equipment and methods, it'd be virtually impossible to identify which musician is actually responsible for generating which noises. However, Whitman in particular seems to be really stretching his legs here, as most of these pieces bear little resemblance to either the fractured IDM of his Hrvatski recordings or the rigorous dronescapes of past albums like 2002's Playthroughs. Tracks like the opener, recorded in Cambridge, Mass., in May 2002, immediately thrust the listener into an inhospitable electronic dust-bowl, with loose, jarring fragments of sound flying from every direction. Other performances, such as the first of two recorded at the Knitting Factory in June 2002, are studded with random, percussive scraps that stubbornly refuse to assemble themselves into recognizable rhythms.

Analord 3 / 4 / 5,AFX,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08eb1335d7bf1698049/1:1/w_160/c8bb02d0.jpg,2005-03-28 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11633-analord-3-4-5/,Rephlex,"A few more books in Richard James' series on the Well-Tempered TB-303. The first two installments weren't bad and there was something exciting in knowing that new material from James' hit the shelf. But the self-imposed restrictions of the Analord project (analog synths used to craft vintage-sounding Analogue Bubblebath-style tracks) are narrow, and the music never takes risks or veers in an unexpected direction. The first two volumes were comforting and pleasant but little else. The same limitations hold for Analord 3-5 and there are still few surprises, but on balance these releases are more exciting. Analord 3 is particularly strong, beginning with ""Boxing Day"", which places a John Carpenter/Gershon Kingsley spooky Moog melody on top of a thrusting electro beat. The various elements are in constant movement in and around each other, and ""Boxing Day"" is busy and energetic even if it never exactly goes anywhere. ""Midievil Rave 1"" is all heavy ugliness, with dissonant and out-of tune sequences and some herky-jerky stop/start action that allows me to picture James riding the fader from all the way across the ocean. And ""Klopjob"", with simple yet funky drum programming and a lovely pastoral melody, is perhaps the best single track in the series so far. Analord 4 is comparatively spare and almost as good. The bouncy ""Crying in Your Face"" has what could be some heavily vocodered vocals (or James could be he's just making the machines talk) and a strong pop feel, while the quiet, menacing ""Home Made Polysynth"" gets same mileage from between-note beats in the manner of Analord 3's ""Midievil Rave 1"". The closing ""Breath March"" is a deceptively great tune. On the one hand it's quiet, with almost nothing happening in the midrange, but the power of the fathoms-deep bass hook could easily be missed without proper playback equipment. There's not much to recommend on the two-track fifth volume. The peppy ""Reunion 2"" has a wickedly squelching acid line that creates its own light trails, and the stiff ""Cilonen"" is by-the-numbers Detroit electro, sounding a bit like Drexciya without the mystery. At the halfway point the conservatism of James' approach is the most notable thing about the Analord series. He's a gifted composer who excels at this style but anyone who has followed his music closely can't help but expect more.","Aphex Twin unveils the next three volumes of his 10-part Analord series.

Awake Is the New Sleep,Ben Lee,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc013d197565213b3b7/1:1/w_160/81adb08b.jpg,2005-03-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4713-awake-is-the-new-sleep/,New West,"Like the class moron who turns out to be developmentally disabled, Ben Lee's no fun to pick on anymore. A vengeful, hype-smiting deity has already rained down the toughest punches: rejection both by the majors and ex-girlfriend Claire Danes, best days past at 26, bottom billing in quasi-supergroup the Bens (and don't tell me it was alphabetical). On Awake Is the New Sleep, the former wunderkind decides the best way to exorcise his post-Danes demons is more syrupy, anonymous light pop. Lee's ""album about waking up"" is as refreshing as a decades-old Nike slogan. ""Just do it, whatever it is,"" the young Aussie advises amid the repetitive finger-picking of opener ""Whatever It Is"". On ""We're All in This Together"", he philosophizes 20-plus times that we're all just that (""yeah!""), so ""open your heart"" and let the ""Hey Jude"" coda in. ""The Debt Collectors"" shoots for Up-era R.E.M., Lee's vocals breaking with tender emotion over rhymes like ""We can make a deal, everything is real"" and similes stolen from Built to Spill album titles. Vapid is the new deep! Mostly, Lee really really misses his girlfriend. He aches for her in ""Ache for You"", feels far away on ""Close I've Come"", gets spurned by would-be rebounds on ""Get Gotten"". The ""Roxanne"" rocksteady of Australian single ""Gamble Everything for Love"" is at least bearable, but its ""you can go your own way"" lyric makes Lee's Fleetwood Mac-pillaging on ""No Right Angles"" that much more obvious (""Dreams"", bitches!). Let the healing start with soft-rocker ""Begin"", which could be this year's ""Cigarettes Will Kill You"" if it ever rose above seventh-grade poetry: ""It's OK for you to care, 'cause I can feel you in the air."" Dumb is the new sensitive! Like a washed-up athlete, Lee's stuck reliving his glory years. Perky U.S. radio hit ""Catch My Disease"" proudly (and ironically) brandishes the obsolete badge of 90s indiedom: ""They don't play me on the radio/ And that's the way I like it."" Lee big ups Good Charlotte, too, and revisits lyrical coup ""open your heart,""-- this time as a chorus. Fellow 90s phenom Brad Wood produces, vainly drenching the lackluster songwriting in the dentist's-office electronica of Lee's 1999 Breathing Tornadoes-- which ""Into the Dark"" name-checks in the most pathetic self-allusion you'll hopefully never hear. The new Ben Lee is the old Ben Lee is every LSAT-flunking strummer in the fraternity of your choice-- and cute, too!","The new Ben Lee is the old Ben Lee is every LSAT-flunking strummer in the fraternity of your choice.

Ghetto Bells,Vic Chesnutt,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ac13d1975652138fea/1:1/w_160/e5610e4f.jpg,2005-03-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1434-ghetto-bells/,New West,"Vic Chesnutt can do a lot with a somber dirge. The 11 tracks on his 12th album plod soddenly, leaden of pace and bleak of atmosphere. Drawn-out running times and a uniform midtempo crawl can test the patience of even a devoted listener, so it's a testament to Chesnutt's intricate and intelligent songwriting that Ghetto Bells is listenable at all. Ghetto Bells eschews the shininess of 2003's Silver Lake for a dirtier, more organic sound. Again, the list of collaborators is impressive: Van Dyke Parks contributes a string arrangement for ""Virginia"" and plays accordion on other tracks; Bill Frisell plays guitar, most notably the mercurial solo on ""Forthright""; Chesnutt's niece Liz Durrett duets on ""What Do You Mean?""; and former Lone Justice and Jayhawks drummer Don Heffington keeps supple time throughout. Producer John Chelew describes the resultant sound as ""nighttime."" Songs like ""Vesuvius"" and ""Virginia"" amble along somnambulantly, and ""Forthright"" conjures a Gothic insomnia as Chesnutt wanders a lonely house contemplating death and hominy. If slow, these songs are ultimately and admirably patient and fluid, building not to grandiloquent climaxes but to a greater and greater complexity of meaning. The album's distinct personality derives from minute nuances. For instance, on ""What Do You Mean?"" Chesnutt's uncertain phrasing of the line ""like a puppy on a trampoline"" contrasts nicely with Durrett's ethereal rejoinder ""what does that mean?"" The result is an intergenerational call-and-response, a joke told in reverse, and a gentle jab at the enduring eccentricities of Chesnutt's lyrics. The hyperquotable ""Vesuvius"" is a standout. It begins with the Herculean task of ""trying to clip the creek to the bank with a clothes pin,"" then declares that ""hypertension is not wisdom."" The line ""Christian charity is a doily over my death boner"" is an epigram in search of a subversive novel, and ""Neapolitan ice cream is never truly integrated/ Until it's too late"" reveals larger implications that transcend the merely personal. Chesnutt is singing about the confusion of race relations and ""whitey boy guilt"" filtered through a skewed sense of humor and an idiosyncratic system of symbols; the muddle itself is the meaning. Meanwhile Heffington's brushed snare and Park's sparkling piano prod the song toward its inevitable Vesuvian eruption. Songs like ""Vesuvius""-- not to mention ""Rambunctious Cloud"" and ""Gnats""-- have depth, a cagey charm, and an elusive mystery that demand not just repeated but aggressive listening. Chesnutt and his collaborators don't make that level of attention easy, but they do make it worthwhile.","Van Dyke Parks, Bill Frisell, and niece Liz Durrett guest on the singer/songwriter's latest LP.

Meltdown,Ash,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11813d1975652138547/1:1/w_160/d666d4fd.jpg,2005-03-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/310-meltdown/,Recordcollection,"Ash are unique in that the older they get, the faster and harder their material becomes. But don't let that fire-bathed, tattoo-inspiring cover art fool you: Ash are still a power-pop band. Meltdown does rock harder, and with more snarl, than any of their previous albums, but they still can't help but reveal their melodic sweet tooth. Meltdown is closest to the slick production of their most recent LP, Free All Angels, though the band's Undertones-esque charm has been shelved to make room for sharpened, arena-ready choruses. Following the success of their recent singles compilation, Meltdown sets its crosshairs precisely at the continent across the pond-- it's their most American-sounding album so far. The irony is that this album has been languishing without a stateside release for the past nine months. Hopefully, no one picked up the import sight unseen and expected to get their face melted-- despite palm-muted guitars and rollicking drums, the approach is a little more Smashing Pumpkins than Judas Priest. Most songs intermittently use heavy riffs as dressing to sneak in their sing-a-long melodies, like lead single ""Orpheus"" and ""Detonator"". Only the springy chord-thrashing of ""Clones"" befits the album's artwork, though given the convincing production from Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, System Of A Down) it would fit snugly into an American modern rock playlist. Meltdown has a cohesive sound, but takes a few dips into cliché, like the power ballad ""Starcrossed"" or the Placebo-like lyrical baiting of ""Vampire Love"". Sadly missing here is Ash's sense of vulnerability, a key element to their charm. While it's an obvious grab for North American ears, if this is anyone's first exposure to Ash, they'd be better off hunting down the group's earlier albums to understand why the band has made it this far; Meltdown is an incomplete picture of what they're capable of.","Nine months after bowing in the UK, Ash's most Americentric LP is finally released in the U.S.

Prisoners of Love,Yo La Tengo,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab009d034d5c69bf3f45/1:1/w_160/eb6a547b.jpg,2005-03-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8872-prisoners-of-love/,Matador,"In case you forgot why you clicked on the link leading to this article, or were distracted by a Neighborhoodies ad: Prisoners of Love is a retrospective of Yo La Tengo's 18 years of music making, using two CDs to cover both the obvious selections and the things you didn't expect to hear. Hey, there's ""Autumn Sweater"". Hey, there's the band's first single. Hey, it's a big day coming. Hey, it's a motherfucker. And, hey, it's a third bonus disc with 16 rarities and never-before released tracks! It's like the Kansas Jello mold I never knew I wanted! That is, until I heard Georgia Hubley singing both an acoustic demo of ""Tom Courtenay"" and a recording of Sun Ra's ""Dreaming"". Feel free to send back the unrecognizable mulching of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" for a full refund, and keep the rest of the music. Operators are standing by. Be warned, though-- instead of chronologically progressing through the band's catalog, Prisoners of Love wants the listener to consider Yo La Tengo's body of work as a timeless object, all songs rising from the same fertile ground. It's a disingenuous approach to take, in some respects-- the early early stuff, for the most part, sounds like Springsteen and R.E.M. happening all at once, and it can stick out like a pair of neon Zubaz when set against the assured and confident music the group made once they found themselves. The one exception to the earnest jangle of the group's salad days is ""The Story of Jazz"", a track from Yo La Tengo Album #2, New Wave Hot Dogs. It's that album's final track, a pisstakey indie-rock rave-up where Ira Kaplan works out his pigfucker tendencies by name-checking and emulating Steve Albini. ""And I saw this band/ Their name escaped me by Thursday/ And the way it happened, looking, look for something to believe in."" On this compilation, it's followed by their recently recorded version of Sun Ra's ""Nuclear War"", wherein the group, dropping f-bombs left and right like they're talking about the weather, sounds a lot meaner and ballsier. Talking tough was never Yo La Tengo's strong suit, though: Yes, they can sound just fine giving the thrash rock of Dead C a trial run (as they do on their version of ""Bad Politics"", available on the Kansas Jello mold), but Yo La Tengo is a lover, not a fighter. ""Sugarcube"", ""Little Eyes"", ""You Can Have It All"", ""Autumn Sweater"", ""By The Time It Gets Dark""-- love love love. (Also, check the name of this collection.) Even when Kaplan's head splits open near the end of ""Pablo and Andrea"", it's all sunshine and lollipops. And when Kaplan sounds most like Thurston Moore (instead of Lou Reed), it's in the service of ""Big Day Coming"", a song that's unabashedly optimistic and ebullient. In some ways, it could be viewed as an answer to the studied rock-and-roll cynicism of ""Teenage Riot""-- ""We can play a Stones song, 'Sittin' on a Fence'/ And it'll sound pretty good, 'til I forget how it ends."" There's Yo La Tengo's 20 years summarized neatly into two lines. If there is one problem with Prisoners of Love, it's the wonky pacing. The first four tracks on Disc One-- the mantra-like ""Shaker"", the organ-haze shimmer of ""Sugarcube"", the not-so-dull roar of ""Barnaby, Hardly Working"", and the gently shuffling ""Little Eyes""-- are all good in and of themselves, but end up butting heads when laid back-to-back. It's only after the fifth track, ""Stockholm Syndrome"", that the disc finally seems to start. Also, each disc tosses in the seven-minute Yo La Tengo jam near the end, because every Yo La Tengo disc has the seven-minute jam. The end is also where the covers are dumped-- Disc One's penultimate track is the group's Casiotronic version ""You Can Have It All"", while Disc Two pulls into the garage with Sandy Denny's ""By The Time It Gets Dark"" hot on the heels of Sun Ra. And, of course, there's the caveat I offered earlier about the haphazard non-chronological song ordering. As odd as that approach might seem, it's a fitting way to pay tribute to the group's catch-all aesthetic. Even if the band's main influence is easily pegged (see: the Velvet Underground, if you haven't already), Yo La Tengo is informed by so many other musics (as their choice in covers will attest) that it's hard to say where one influence ends and another begins. It's an approach that's mirrored in how the group switches it up on the mic. If you're not paying attention, you might mistake Hubley's croon for Kaplan's warble, and you might mistake James McNew's high-pitched voice as either Hubley or Kaplan reaching for the high C over C. It's also mirrored in how they denote songwriting credit-- all songs written by members of Yo La Tengo are attributed to Yo La Tengo, not to individuals. Three people, one voice, one body of song. The subtitle to this collection calls Prisoners of Love ""A Smattering of Scintillating Senescent Songs"". That 10-cent word in the subtitle-- senescent-- means ""old"" or ""aging."" As Byron Coley tells it in the liner notes, this ""aging"" involved the group transforming ""from folk-rock reinvigorators into loose-stringed riff monsters, keyboard dream-pop hypnotizers, and beyond."" Fine wines wish they could age as well as Yo La Tengo.","Indie rock legends Yo La Tengo get the compilation treatment with two discs of the best from their eclectic career.

Awfully Deep,Roots Manuva,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31d5e6ef9596932058d/1:1/w_160/7e54c28f.jpg,2005-03-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6944-awfully-deep/,Big Dada,"For all I know, 2001 was a great year for Roots Manuva. The British rapper's album Run Come Save Me had introduced a heavy, claustrophobic, dub-inflected strain of hip-hop, going gold in the UK and earning Manuva a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the process. But I can't shake the image of Manuva staring at the ""21 Seconds"" video, shaking his head, muttering to himself, realizing that his time was over just as it was starting. Since 2001, everything has changed. Grime has become Britain's homegrown hip-hop, and Manuva can't possibly hope to compete. As an MC, Manuva is more Tricky than Kano. He uses the empty spaces of his slow, layered tracks, laying his strong, commanding voice over the top of the beat rather than riding it. It's not that he's not a good rapper-- he is-- but if he was a contestant on Making the Band 2 and Diddy made him freestyle against Ness or Chopper, he'd stare at his shoes and mumble: ""Um, toast, um, government conspiracies. Um. I like dub."" D Double E would eat him for breakfast. But then, D Double E would never record a track of vague slam poetry about ""mystic maze of sonic mathematics"" mumbled over late-Specials chamber-ska; Manuva does just that on ""The Haunting"". Awfully Deep is Manuva's Kid A move, his retreat from street-rap relevance to navel-gazing experimentation. On older tracks like ""Witness (1 Hope)"", Manuva's voice was sharp and urgent; he had something to prove. These days, he sounds old and tired, and he knows it. ""This could well be my last LP/ I've had a good run, I've made a few Gs/ I've had a bit of fun, I've smoked a few trees/ And now I wanna rest my knobbly knees,"" he raps on ""Colossal Insight"". As a result, Awfully Deep makes for churning, menacing background music. Manuva did much of the production himself, and the album's oceanic basslines, winding laser synths, and echoing guitar ripples dissipate nicely into the air. But Manuva still sounds nicest on songs like ""Rebel Heart"" and ""Chin High"", brittle, ominous tracks that don't sound too far removed from grime. Manuva has the force, vision, and charisma to remain relevant, to keep ahead of the game. He's too good to let the world pass him by, but that's exactly what will happen if he continues to disappear inside himself.","UK hip-hop's biggest name releases his first post-grime LP, retreating from street-rap into navel-gazing experimentation.

Guero,Beck,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2519d034d5c69bf2b88/1:1/w_160/03fa15c5.jpg,2005-03-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/621-guero/,Geffen,"PATIENT PROGRESS ASSESSMENT: MARCH 2005 Subject: Beck Hansen, 35 years old, Caucasian Medical History: Physically, subject's health is good; no major or chronic issues, although voice suggests persistent sinusitis. Psychologically, Mr. Hansen shows a history of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), diagnosed in 1995 and treated intermittently via analysis and hypnosis. Subject's recorded personalities include: Dust Bowl-era folk singer, prone to wearing flannel, acoustic guitar always present, unable to leave house without harmonica clip (see attached materials, One Foot in the Grave). Ardent practitioner of ""hip-hop,"" exhibits ""word salad"" symptomology characteristic of schizophrenics (see Mellow Gold). Self-described ""space cowboy."" Similar to personality #1, except with claimed origin in future, rather than past. Also known to dabble in bossa nova. (see Mutations). Smooth-talking sexaholic, race indeterminate. Causes subject to wear small outfits with big collars. Frequently does ""the splits."" Earnestness of personality questionable. (see Midnite Vultures). Depressive, excessively self-reflective middle-aged man. Moves at very slow pace, exhibits fetish for exotic string arrangements, and shows delusional belief that he's Blood on the Tracks-era Bob Dylan. By far his least enjoyable persona; friends report being ""really bummed out"" in his presence when these traits are dominant (see Sea Change). Mr. Hansen has experienced one distinct period of personality cohesion, which is widely considered to be his most healthy and agreeable time (see attached materials, Odelay). Since this psychological peak, the patient has experienced pressure to return to this state, wherein all of the above personae peacefully co-exist to create a unique and well-balanced whole. However, Mr. Hansen has appeared unable or unwilling to bend to these outside demands, instead spending periods of 1-2 years at various extremes of the above stated categories. Current Session: Lately, Mr. Hansen has shown an increased willingness to accept the advice of his peers and doctors, mounting a highly motivated and publicized effort to return to the behavioral cohesion of his Odelay period. Reuniting with his therapists of that era, the Dust Brothers (Drs. M. Simpson and J. King, M.D, Ph.D), he has made a lot of progress towards this goal, exhibiting behavior (see attached media, Guero) that appears to resemble his healthier days. But whether this restoration of character balance is merely superficial, and, furthermore, whether it is the proper attitude for the patient, remains to be determined. Note the resemblance of Guero opener ""E-Pro"" to Odelay's ""Devil's Haircut"", both tracks assembled from guitar-driven riff-loops and Mr. Hansen's drowsy talking-blues delivery. Notice that the twangy-acoustic vs. turntable-scratch paradoxes of ""Jackass"" are repeated on ""Earthquake Weather"" and ""Farewell Ride"". Further antecedent is seen in the quirk collage (sonar blips, harmonica, Christina Ricci) of ""Hell Yes"", which can be directly traced back to the earlier period's ""High 5 (Rock the Catskills)"". That the patient is re-visiting past combinations of his constituent personalities is not in itself a cause for worry; after all, it is what most of his support system has been suggesting for many years. But one wonders whether Mr. Hansen's heart is in the proceedings, as many of the songs appear to be little more than weak echoes of their similar predecessors. Furthermore, stray remnants of individual personality types, particularly the most recently-seen ""mope"" character, pop up on ""Missing"" and ""Broken Drum,"" in the form of slow tempos and ""Blue Jay Way"" strings. Other areas give indications of new, healthy ways of rectifying the contradictions within Mr. Hansen's torrid mind. ""Girl"" uses an NES symphony prologue to introduce a Cali-rock pastiche, the sweetness of which overcomes its serial killer lyrics and ""Hey Ya"" biting. ""Black Tambourine"" finds the patient stripping down his usual methods, concentrating on foreboding rhythms and gimmick economy, while ""Earthquake Weather"" is similarly sparse, and sees Mr. Hansen using his falsetto for a purpose other than adding a musical wink to his less serious efforts. All in all, my assessment of the patient's recent advances is a mixed one. Mr. Hansen has certainly attempted to follow the regimen recommended to him, and has done his best to recapture earlier moments of lucidity and unity, but in many ways the final result feels rote and calculated. It seems likely that what worked for the subject almost ten years ago may not be appropriate at this later stage; in today's landscape, the methods seem a bit obsolete and over-prescribed. Mr. Hansen may have given us what we demanded, but, at this juncture, we should consider that his personalities have drifted so far apart that they are better left that way.","Contemporary rock's top chameleon gives the people what they want, drafting in the Dust Brothers to try to recapture his Odelay persona and sound.

In the Clear,Ivy,by: Stephen M.

Never mind that the band had by then been around for years and that two-thirds of it-- Adam Schlesinger and Durrand's husband, Andy Chase-- were not only American but did double duty in Long Island\xD0based Fountains of Wayne. Since then, Ivy took steps away from their Francophilia on 2001's overlooked Long Distance and the 2002 covers album Guest Room, Schlesinger wooed Stacy's mom 24-7 on MTV, and Durrand released an EP and an album with side project Paco. On In the Clear, their fifth full-length, Ivy sounds less like a 90s throwback than a late-eighties throwback. Their brand of jetset pop has grown so aerodynamic and mature, so sophisticated and airtight, that they're beginning to sound like Danny Wilson, Johnny Hates Jazz, or Breathe. That comparison may read like a harsh criticism, but this trajectory doesn't necessarily lead downward. Much of In the Clear sounds slick and over-rehearsed, but songs like ""Thinking About You"" and ""Tess Don't Tell"" recapture the winsome mood of the band's best work. On the opener, ""Nothing But the Sky"", a low-key wash of reverby keyboards and starry-eyed guitars keeps Durrand's voice aloft as she drifts ""15 miles high."" On ""Four in the Morning"", a low bass line intermingles with an acoustic guitar to create a lonely a.m. ambience, and a backmasked guitar adds an eddying solo to ""Ocean City Girl"". But most songs on In the Clear focus on delivering bittersweet hooks instead of evocative atmosphere. ""Corners of Your Mind"" has a mod energy in its chorus, and Brazilian composer Zé Luis's subtle string arrangement adds snap to ""Thinking About You"". As the chiaroscuro cover image implies, the album is about movement and travel, a theme that aligns with the band's strengths. Like Nina Persson and Francoise Hardy, Durrand benefits from the sleepy detachment in her voice; on these 10 songs that quality makes her sound resigned yet wide-eyed and even hopeful. Here, constant motion is not a luxury but an emotional necessity: ""In a world without you,"" Durrand sings, ""all I can do is keep moving."" As produced by Chase and Schlesinger and mixed by Steve Osbourne, the album tries to conjure the anchorlessness of travel, but instead it sounds oddly weightless, floating by pleasantly but unobtrusively and rarely demanding your attention, as if the music is dissolving into the ether as it leaves your speakers. In the Clear ultimately proves too airy, too ephemeral: each song exists only when it's playing, washing over you but rarely lingering once it ends.","After ogling Stacy's mom, Fountains of Wayne's Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase return to their Francophile indie pop project.

The Alternative to Love,Brendan Benson,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27813d197565213889f/1:1/w_160/f77035fa.jpg,2005-03-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/657-the-alternative-to-love/,V2,"Brendan Benson smokes a lot of cigarettes. He's also had a lot of girlfriends, most of whom have left him. This combination is the nuclear fission of pop songwriting, and the afflicted can (and do) write inexhaustibly about the topics. Benson has been at it for almost a decade, and until now he's shown no sign of shaking his nicotine grievances. But there may be hope for him yet: On the title track to his new album (a song carried over from his 2003 EP Metarie), we learn he's been ""forever in search of the alternative to love."" Has he found it? Nah. Benson's verbalizes his commitment to change, but action precedes essence, mon frere, and while The Alternative to Love is an well-intentioned record, Benson ends up sticking to his water pistols, squirting lovelorn power-pop spooned with la-la vanilla. I imagine Benson works game the same way his songs ingratiate themselves, which is to say he knows smiling indomitability can be endearing when the hipsters' disinterested shtick grows tiresome. Jaunty and overeager to reach the chorus, ""Spit It Out"" abides its title. But while it isn't ""Tiny Spark"" (Lapalco's stellar opener and Benson's Saturn commercial-poached claim to fame), ""Spit It Out"" has its charms, including a tease of a chorus that pulls back right when you expect it to explode. ""Cold Hands Warm Heart"" features The Alternative to Love's most appealing come-on: a twinkling, pendulous bell melody that perfectly captures Benson's brand of shrug-it-off determination. The rest of the track is an exercise in la-di-da filler. On ""I Feel Like Myself Again"", Benson proves himself a master pop mathematician, slithering around an offset beat to deliver a wontedly chewy vocal hook. He keeps saying something about ""just wait till I feel like myself again,"" but up to this point Benson has been in top form. The Alternative to Love's opening triumvirate is as strong as any string of songs he's written, and the wistful finality of the sweetly cathartic title track foreshadows a disappointing comedown. If Benson had chosen to cut the album here, he would have had a perfect EP. Unfortunately, breakup tales can only go as far as their melodies and arrangements carry them, and The Alternative to Love fails to rise as soaringly above Benson's pablum in its second half. We're not asking for wit and personality, just the saccharine-drunk that helps blur the messy details. ""Flesh and Bone"" brings a hippocampus-feasting melody but can't match the svelte sophistication of its predecessors. And although Tchad Blake's mixing is a fabulous constant, his consistency means the weaker tracks are revealed for what they are: solid formula-followers lacking the elusive intangible charm that an unexpected note or rhythmic tic can bring. Latecomers ""Get It Together"" and ""Last Man Standing"" stir up a fuzz storm, but closer ""Between Us"" is more ellipsis than exclamation point, and that's a pretty accurate reflection of the kind of songwriter Benson is. On ""Last Man Standing"" he sums it up best: ""I have friends that are married and their lives are complete, and here I am stumbling down a darkened street."" Benson knows better than anyone that being a beautiful failure beats tidy, predictable success any day.","Detroit singer/songwriter and Jack White pal tells more breakup tales.

The Shunned Country,Bob Drake,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0c9d034d5c69bf537d/1:1/w_160/95d11276.jpg,2005-03-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2442-the-shunned-country/,ReR,"Not many normal folks live around here anymore. I walked near the gates of the old house, but too near, cognizant as I was of whomever might be resting inside. This place was so barren of life and movement; you'd think nothing had been born here in 50 years. It reminded me of the Midwest, in America, driving there for hours on a two-lane highway nested between endless gray and brown fields of wild grass, barbed wire and the occasional wooden barn or tool shed, such as I was passing now. Of course, this is countryside in France, a world away from Illinois and what I never considered more than the Drab American Backdrop. I'd heard the people here stopped answering their doors after having one too many strange things show up. What a strange story. I'm going to see my friend Bob. He lives about 10 kilometers north in a cottage with his wife. He records all his music there in his own old, wooden barn. It's kind of funny to think that in the middle of all this decaying landscape, withering branches and mud that squirms like maggots near puddles of last week's rain, sits old Bob Drake recording music like some castaway of an art commune hell-bent on making folk hymns for ghosts, interspersed with avant-prog etudes and fragmented horror-show symphonettes. I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to making the trek from Razes to Caudeval. After you pass the main road, there's not much but the ""scenery"". This place is cold. Nobody around here is willing to discuss the events that led them to dynamite the graveyard. I asked a few townspeople in Razes about it, but got only abrupt frowns in return, as if I'd said something offensive. I'd read about it before the flight, knowing Bob was into that kind of thing. However, seeing this place now, I wish I'd read more. Staring at this old house (curiously, it seems generally well kept-- I wonder if someone still lives here), rotting wood and whistling wind behind me, yellow-gray skies and the sun completely obscured by some pretty fucking odd cloud formations has me semi-spooked. I mean, I'm not deathly afraid of anything, but I have a chill that I can't pin completely on the breeze. The clouds are elongated and bending in unnaturally bizarre ways, as if God was strung out and particularly pessimistic today. The reputation of the house by the river isn't so good, and from what I understand, it wasn't exactly improved by what they found there after the recent storm (""freakishly localized"", per Bob, though he tends to get macabre in weird moments). I've been staring at the front door for fifteen minutes now, getting colder and thinner in my cheek. I hate it when my mind wanders like this. I hate it because I'm at the mercy of whatever ""spirits"" inhabit this place. Like the wind, and that damn chattering grass. I don't think I've ever heard grass make noise like that. I don't think I've ever heard grass click and resonate like hollow wood. Hollow, dead, decomposing wood. Brown and black, and wet with muddy water, housing the eggs of mosquitoes and bacteria and parasites eating the life out of long-buried roots. Even the stars rot here, so the wolves can fly at night, driven by the scent of blood and small, crushed bones of whatever birds were unlucky enough to choose this route from the north. They say a noxious looking oily cloud came down into the yard here one day, and ever since then the things that grow here are deformed. Poisonous and evil. Where is the sun? Yes, and now someone is looking at me from the house. I hate it here. Why did I come this way? I can truthfully say that if I could pick a time to kick the bucket, I'd pick some other day. Who's there? ""Hello?"" No one answers. ""Hello? Can you help me?"" No one answers. The wind around my neck is coarse; it makes my hair scrape against my head, just like the grass in the yard of this house. I'm opening the gate. I've heard a lot about this house. I've heard too much, and haven't seen enough. I'm coming to the front door. I'm doing it. I'm going to open the door. ""Witch house"" be damned. Yellow fangs, loathsome tittering, hybrid blasphemy, morbid atrocity, paws-like-little-hands be damned. This is the shunned country. I bet you can get a place here real cheap. I remember he said, ""if I were you, I'd avoid it."" The shunned country. I'm going to open the door now. I'm tired of being afraid of this house. I'm tired of being afraid. ""Hello?""","Here Drake sounds like some art commune castaway hell-bent on making folk hymns for ghosts, interspersed with avant-prog etudes and fragmented horror-show symphonettes.

Rettet Die Wale,Gustav,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c016eb335119a49ed32b/1:1/w_160/d6abb08a.jpg,2005-03-24 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3669-rettet-die-wale/,Mosz,"With bubbly one-name international acts like Annie and M.I.A. dropping killer LPs in recent months, the current female pop landscape's been enjoying the diversity of a Captain Planet episode. Which is why, when I first threw on Gustav's Rettet Die Wale after only hearing perky single ""We Shall Overcome"", I was expecting another foreign enchantress delivering sugary melodies in broken English over genre-bending beats. Boy, was I wrong. For one, Gustav, aka Eva Jantschitsch, is closer to a one-woman Ms. John Soda than a global pop diva, and some fiddling on Freetranslation.com reveals the album title's politically charged message, ""Save the Whales"", as a sign of activism to come. However, Jantschitsch is way too intricate and arcane to simply rant about environmentalism and human rights for 40-plus minutes. Just as lush strings and woodwinds clash with synthetic IDM on the album, Jantschitsch's quirky intonation creates a perplexing dynamic between the vocals and gravely suggestive song titles. Take the title track, for example, where Jantschitsch croons the title mantra in German over strings borrowed from a Sinatra session. In addition to rescuing Shamu, we're also urged to fuck the system and get laid, a meta take on popular liberalism. Similarly, on the tragic ""One Hand Mona"", the portentous line ""she lost her left arm and married Karl"" is sung with a quiver and a smirk, as if Jantschitsch's on the verge of cracking up at her star-crossed protagonist. The sonics on Rettet Die Wale, however, are far less veiled. The brainy Jantschitsch taps an extensive range of musical sources ranging from Eno to Björk to Civil Rights songs, grounding all of them in cut-and-dry laptop pop. She's perfectly content to disassemble a straightforward pop song and stretch its melody and chord progression over several more bars than necessary, isolating each individual constituent from the conglomerate. As a result, the slow-tempo numbers here require considerable patience; the six-plus minute ""Little Weird Grrrl"" doesn't burst from its rigid seems until the final 60 seconds, and a shrill organ in the Gothic ""Mein Bruder"" chillingly resonates for the song's duration, filling the listener with either absolute terror or ennui. This inconspicuous backdrop pushes the vocals uncomfortably to the sonic foreground. Unlike the breathy lap-pop vocals of groups like the Notwist and Lali Puna, Jantschitsch's protrude in the mix, drawing attention to every lyric or inflective tick. ""Da, Am Monopøl"" and ""We Shall Overcome"", with their intricately proactive arrangements, are two notable exceptions, but the majority of the album leaves us to grapple with cryptic lyrics, which gloss over the tedious music beneath. Fortunately Jantschitsch's bookish, She's All That charisma is enough to maintain interest, and while you may have no clue what she's saying, you'll somehow come away more cultured in the end.","Brainy electro-pop from this politically minded Austrian.

"Sing ""Other People""",The Angels of Light,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09b13d1975652138418/1:1/w_160/9fc9e159.jpg,2005-03-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/188-sing-other-people/,Young God,"I first knew I liked Angels of Light's Sing ""Other People"" when my Busch Light-swigging, Kenny Chesney-worshipping ex-roommate-- who hadn't once, in six months, said a word about any of the music I played constantly during our time together-- mistook the singer for Johnny Cash. If you were lead Angel Michael Gira, what would you be more flattered by: Passing for the ""man in black"", or conveying to someone who had remained so militantly mum about, quite literally, a thousand other bands? Whereas it once might have seemed ludicrous, the comparison is no longer that far off: Nearly 20 years removed from his work with seminal sadist folk-rockers Swans, Gira sounds sobered (if not necessarily sober) and peacefully wearied. Without the drone-soaked meditations and wild-eyed dynamic spirograms, Gira's music is now, shockingly, almost docile. For that alone, Sing ""Other People"" is a gutsy record. It maintains the band's lo-fi intimacy while expanding its breadth to include back-up singing and more voluminous instrumentation. Fans of Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home, the Angels' tumultuous 2003 stab at lysergic goth-folk, shouldn't be faulted for thinking they're hearing a different band altogether. Part of this metamorphosis can be attributed to the assistance of fellow Young God signees Akron/Family, whose self-titled debut is seeing contemporaneous release. Opener ""Lena's Song"" stakes Gira's booming baritone against a glistening backdrop of nylon-string plucking, fretless bass, glockenspiel, and a chipper Beach Boys-esque vocal harmony. The song proves Angels of Light capable of clarity and levity, qualities missing (not unfortunately) from their previous work. ""My Friend Thor"" is as subtle an act of self-immolation as a club to the head from its namesake: It starts acoustic, with a laconic Gira following the rigid outline of his strumming, before he's blindsided by a burbling gamelan orchestra. The detour moves the song from the sound of stark isolation to a full-on fireside jamboree, replete with a veritable tabernacle-full of backup vocalists. ""Michael's White Hands"" and ""Purple Creek""-- a pleasantly woozy nocturne that features actual howling-- recall the melodrama of Angels of yore. But Sing ""Other People"" goes easy on the sexual anger, capitulating to a refreshingly mundane flavor of storytelling. Gira doesn't take the move lightly-- he seems at times to be grasping for well-worn territory before refocusing himself with a rap on the noggin. In the end, the album is like an afternoon in an overstocked Salvation Army thrift store spent trying on heaps and heaps of secondhand merchandise, a lot of which is ridiculously colored, or an awkward fit, etc. But Gira's songs have many one-of-a-kind nuances that tether the album even when it ventures.","Former Swans leader Michael Gira maintains Angels of Light's lo-fi intimacy while expanding its breadth to include more voluminous instrumentation.

Solarized,Ian Brown,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3bc5e6ef959693206e8/1:1/w_160/f7e4a9fe.jpg,2005-03-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/969-solarized/,Koch,"The Stone Roses were a supernova, their debut album a bright flash in the pop universe that remains a signpost and a favorite more than 15 years later. Ever since 1989, though, we've been treated to the gradually fading glow from that initial burst-- Second Coming was a dim reflection of their former glory that took too long to make. We won't bother talking about former Roses guitarist John Squire's Seahorses project and subsequent failure to do much of anything, but I remember when I heard Ian Brown's first solo effort, 1998's Unfinished Monkey Business. It was such a crappy record that I gave up on him completely, admitting to myself that one fantastic album and a bunch of pale shadows was all I'd ever get from this crew (Mani's contributions to Primal Scream notwithstanding). I shouldn't have been completely dismissive to Brown: The two albums he's released since Unfinished haven't been great, but they've at least had flashes of something interesting and even a few genuinely killer songs mixed in amongst the puzzling experiments. Solarized, his fourth under his own steam, is his most focused, consistent solo album yet. There's nothing terribly new to the electro-psych sound he's worked up for himself-- it actually throws back quite a bit to the Roses-- but here he has a clutch of great melodies for him to hang his honey-dipped voice on, and he delivers those nicely. It frequently helps to ignore the lyrics, mostly worn post-Britpop platitudes like ""Let the stars shine on/ 'Til the break of dawn,"" from opener ""Longsight M13"". He gets angry and topical on ""Kiss Ya Lips (No ID)"", decrying national ID cards and singing with gritty emotion instead of his trademark arrogant disaffection, but he addresses his complaints to ""Mr. Politician"" and other vague entities of authority, which doesn't help his cause. Thankfully, ""Kiss Ya Lips"" has a sweet, spiky groove, a monster bassline, and a simple, direct beat that makes it one of the album's best tracks. The strength of the record is songs such as that-- effortlessly melodic and insanely catchy, they don't care what year it is or that trip-hop is deader than dead, and they're better for it. ""One Way Ticket to Paradise"" is a heavy guitar beatfest that nods to bhangra by way of Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"" and it's best if you pay no mind to how all the parts fit together and just nod your head to the deliberate tempo. So does this restore my faith in Brown or make me mourn the members of the Stone Roses' sophomore (and junior, and senior) slumps any less? Well, no, though I'm happy that he finally gave us something that's better than merely listenable-- and that his solo career is improving, one small step at a time.","Ian Brown's solo output continues to improve, but he's still below the Mendoza line.

Surrounded By Silence,Prefuse 73,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1185e6ef959693200f1/1:1/w_160/3cbe19dc.jpg,2005-03-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6452-surrounded-by-silence/,Warp,"If Surrounded By Silence were a movie, it'd be one of those Technicolor Cecil B. DeMille epics that boldface hype ""A Cast of Thousands."" If it were a concert, it would be an indie-verse Live Aid. If it were a story, it'd be that chapter of Ulysses where James Joyce introduces the reader to just about every goddamn person in Dublin. We're talking a big canvas here, with so many guest stars you can't spit without moistening someone who has spent time on the (CMJ) charts. All of which is somewhat of a U-turn for Scott Herren's best-known pseudonym, as the Prefuse 73 catalog has been distinct among its IDM environs for being emotional, intimate, and focused affairs. Prefuse albums have had guests over for dinner before, but rarely so marquee (sorry, Prekop) and never in such numbers...hell, I'm hard pressed to think of any non-compilation that has featured so many interlopers. Whether Herren is using Surrounded By Silence to spread the word about some of his favorite acts, or to insta-build a portfolio of outside production work, or a little of both, it's a much different-- and far more inconsistent-- affair than previous Prefuse efforts. Much of the blame for this unevenness lies with Herren's attempts at hip-hop production, a role with tantalizing potential that so far had only been teased at with isolated, underwhelming efforts for Diverse, MF Doom, and others. Silence's first taste of Prefuse on the decks, ""Hideyaface"", finds Herren brokering a backpacker's dream summit of Wu-Tang and Def Jux municipalities. Sadly, it's outperformed by the instrumental reprise that appears down the tracklist, containing a merely routine showing by Ghostface that nevertheless still manages to embarrass the cottonmouth delivery of El-P, who lamely titles himself ""Laserface"" and follows the Def Jux party line of substituting hyperlogia for talent. (See also: Aesop Rock's blunder through ""Sabbatical with Options"".) Only charismatic tracks with Jux defector Beans (""Morale Crusher"") and relative unknown Camu (""Now You're Leaving"") manage to fulfill the concept's promise, leaving one to wonder whether Herren is the victim of phoned-in MC work (looking at you, Masta Killah and GZA) or whether his considerable talents just don't adapt to background duty. Indeed, the composition of tracks like ""Just the Thought"" seems neutered compared to usual Prefuse material, short on ideas and compromising complexity. Ironically, it might be Herren's knack for atmospherics and jazz-like swing that keep his hip-hop dalliances from liftoff, as they tend to amplify rather than alleviate the dreary bookishness of underground rap emcees. Appearances by artists from the rock and electronic side of the indie fence score slightly better on Surrounded By Silence, ranging from the disastrously shrill performance by Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino to the delicious laptop jam between Prefuse and ihe Books. That latter track, ""Pagina Dos"", is pretty much exactly what you would expect from its constituent parts, but no less entrancing for it; an all-too-brief mixture of fractured banjo, chop-chop dialogue, and an itchier, funkier beat than the Books would normally allow themselves. ""And I'm Gone"" somehow manages to squeeze another Herren alias (Piano Ovelord), Stereolabbites Broadcast, and Mexican outfit Café Tacuba into a less-than-three-minutes package, but makes it work as dense, dreamy psychedelia Caribou/Manitoba would envy. The two appearances by Claudia Deheza from On! Air! Library! (one with twin sister Alejandra) similarly make me reach for the ""ethereal"" meme, breezy like Herren's Savath + Savalas project, but without sacrificing the trademark Prefuse lope-swing and scissorhands editing. Almost lost amidst the collaboration addiction are a handful of Prefuse-only tracks, the placement of which makes even the longer compositions feel like interludes. That's a shame, because while Herren shows signs of recycling old ideas (the album-opening fanfare, the wandering bassline of ""Ty versus Detchibe""), some of these solitary works outshine the superstar vehicles. ""Expressing Views is Obviously Illegal"" is the Prefuse concept at its best, with jazz, hip-hop, and IDM elements all colliding in a granola-bar musicology lecture. Similarly, ""Minutes Away Without You,"" reprises the One Word Extinguisher trick for juicing sentiment out of loops and samples, a slow jam tempo complimented by late-night noir horns. Yet, if I may be albumist for a moment, it's this emotional core that's lacking from Surrounded By Silence, which is so caught up in the red-carpet procession that it loses the flow and cohesion of Prefuse's prior efforts. Like John Wayne popping up as a Roman guard in the crucifixion scene of The Greatest Story Ever Told, any momentum achieved by the music gets tripped up by another celebrity appearance and the ensuing reach for the liner notes. Getting by with a lot of help from his friends is clearly Herren's goal on Surrounded By Silence, but that doesn't keep the fulfillment of that goal from making the album his least rewarding effort yet under this name.","Scott Herren follows two LPs of pioneering glitch-hop with a more guest-heavy third full-length, one that includes appearances from the Books, El-P, and a handful of Wu-Tang Clan members.

Their reward was a hit single and a recording budget, used to create a platinum album, and their worst crime was watering down Helmet and Soundgarden riffs. Don't blame them; blame the record labels, blame alternative radio, blame the 90s. However, former Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns is entirely to blame for the failure that is the Dissociatives. And this debut, created with co-writer Paul Mac, is a sweeping, Technicolor failure but like train wrecks and plastic surgery makeover shows, it's an oddly fascinating mess. ""We're Much Preferred Customers"" opens the LP with a soft 4/4 thud and manipulated vocals. Johns then whispers non-sequiturs like ""And skin that flakes like ancient paint/ Suffocate contentment"" over sparse piano before the song builds to a pounding climax of keyboards and multi-harmonized nonsense. It's such a shameless imitation of Radiohead's ""Everything in Its Right Place"" that it'd be grounds for infringement if their attempt wasn't so laughable. But from there the album moves from merely bad-- the strained, disjointed electro-pop ""Somewhere Down the Barrel""-- into the brain-melting disaster ""Horror with Eyeballs"". It features a carnival-like verse melody and another wall of Johnses on the chorus, singing ""All of this time on my hands/ So far has gone/ To feeding my animals"" amid distorted, barking ""na-na-na's"". It's a mad professor's experiment that's been given a pop polish, and it sounds like Backstreet Boys covering Captain Beefheart in a bad way. Only the strong will make it through the entire track. The rest of the tracks songs are merely bland: ""Forever and a Day"" is whiny adult-contempo, and ""Old Man, Young Man"" sets its compass towards the Beatles, almost making it out of mire before the chorus turns into Collective Soul. ""Thinking in Reverse"" is another near-miss that squanders a kinetic beat on an overwrought melody. Leftfield techno vet Paul Mac seems stale working away from a club-oriented context, but it's Johns who seems out of his depth. Maybe he can write a three-chord rock song, but here he under-sings, over-emotes, and writes melodies that spiral off in insane directions before ending up nowhere-- all while multi-tracking his vocals to cover his failings. In a way, this album validates the achievements of the aforementioned Radiohead and other electronic-dabbling rockers: ProTools and bong hits do not an artist make, nor will an electronic sheen save Johns' turgid performance.","Psych-pop comeback LP from...former Silverchair singer Daniel Johns.

Now available on CD for the first time, complete with liner notes by Current 93's David Tibet, this album is the type of bizarre curio that-- though it can't honestly be said to have universal appeal-- should be an endless source of fascination for those with an appetite for florid post-hippie excess. Comprised of three lengthy tracks, Mice and Rats in the Loft amply showcases the formidable talents of multi-instrumentalists Michael Bairstow and Derek Noy, joined here by drummer Dennis Conlan. Throughout these pieces, the musicians gallop exuberantly across genre borderlines, gobbling everything in their path as though afraid that some stray idea or blinker of inspiration might somehow escape their clutches before they can commit it to tape. The album opens with the utterly staggering prog-folk epic ""Sun Symphonica"". Over the course of nearly 19 minutes, it careens chaotically from hyperactive folk strumming through meadows of muted jazzy woodwinds, lazing for a time in ornate chamber music splendor before again returning to THC-addled art-rock reminiscent of such groups as the Soft Machine or Gong. Overflowing with trilling, theatrical vocals and contributions by flute, violin, clarinet, and exotic percussion, this manic tour de force is so dense that after awhile it becomes difficult to name instruments that don't get used. Towards song's end they even cap the indulgence with a completely gratuitous harmonica solo, drawing the confounding piece to an appropriately arbitrary close. The following ""Call of the Wild"" finds Jan Dukes in somewhat more conventional British folk regions, raising their strident voices in praise of the liberated life (""I will be free to sleep where I want and with who and what I will."") These vocals emote even more fervently on the closing title track, telling gruesome tales of ancient bloody rituals (""The screams of the victims still echo/ though it's centuries since they died"") with gleeful relish as heavy droplets of Hendrixian wah-wah guitar gather in puddles at their feet. Some of the more flute-heavy passages veer uncomfortably close to Jethro Tull territory, but Mice and Rats in the Loft generally manages to avoid the prog-rock pitfalls of bloated self-satisfaction and pomposity, as the Jan Dukes instead infuse their music with enough psychedelic grit, sonic invention, and sheer unfaked strangeness to make this album a knotty puzzle worth many return visits.","Current 93's David Tibet oversees the reissue of this sprawling 1971 British prog-folk album.

The first track from Flies the Fields is yet another diversion: ""Axons and Dendrites"" is a slow-builder with a jaunty rhythm that only reveals a melody just before its abrupt finish. But, on the whole, Flies the Fields doesn't build on the experimentation of their three most recent EPs-- collected on Three-Four. Instead, this record sounds like a step backward. The majority of Flies the Fields is bogged down by too much discipline. The guitar jangle of ""Louven"" is a bit flat-footed, and ""It's Not Too Late"" toes the line between tense and droning before crawling into the latter. The performances here are capable, but the melodies consistently interlock and drone, and the drums merely underline the crescendos. ""While songs like '(Morays or) Demons' may flirt with rocking out, the album feels like a jam session that was never edited or arranged into proper songs (""proper"" being relative to the genre). The ominous, whisper-sung vocals, creeping bass, jangling guitars, and prodding drums have all been used to greater effect in countless other places-- heck, they've been pulled off better by the members of Shipping News themselves. Stranger still is that the songs with variation or texture are pushed to the end of the record. The final third of Flies rewards your patience: ""The Human Face"" starts slowly, drops off into silence, and returns with the album's most spirited, rocking performance and stop-start precision from the rhythm section. ""Untitled w/Drums"" features a truly stunning melody sung by overlapping male and female vocals, and shows the band stepping out of the stiff roles they've been playing on Flies up until now. ""Untitled"" segues into the final ""Paper Lanterns"", a creepy, industrial throb that I'd label as an album highlight-- just as its original version was a highlight of the Three-Four compilation. The new ""Paper Lanterns"" may be even more captivating than the original, but it could also be a warning sign that the Shipping News' collective pen is running dry.","Another LP of disciplined post-rock from former and current members of Rachel's, June of 44, and Rodan.

The Edmonton hip-hop head Pemberton aka Pimperton aka Cadence Weapon has just released his debut ""mixtape,"" scribbling the e-pen that skewered Juelz and Vast Aire to put his own rhymes on the e-line and rep the production skills that already got Lady Sov going blah blah blah (a good thing). I scarequote ""mixtape"" cause the term beguiles here. The 19 tracks on Cadence Weapon Is the Black Hand aren't actually mixed, and confusing things even more gloriously, Cadence's chameleonic delivery suggests the tape's got a whole crew behind it. One track he's all paragraph pilates like Gift of Gab (""Reeking of rifle precision, like my life is a prism/ Then mark off the list, I bark often, twist off the tryst of a prism/ And life is an ism, on the real, vice versa, verse a vice/ When you're labelled by your genre, my personal price/ Of immersion in the right right""-- he gets that all out in about five seconds), the next he's Doomy (""Up in the club on some 'How're you?'/ But I don't like photos like Howard Hughes""), and in between he softens his consonants like Z and irrrrs his ers like Aesop and Sage Francis. Elsewhere, Cadence's hometown shoutouts get Simon Reynolds off his back. While most of us can't appreciate the local flavor of ""Oliver Square"", we feel Cadence's connection to them, and the low-level mystery of it all-- like the best low-level mysteries-- keeps us on pins. The city, seemingly forgotten by as many Canadians as the millions of Americans who don't watch ice hockey, serves as an ideal backdrop for Cadence's occasional ""people are gonna respect me if it kills them"" demeanor: ""Don't generalize, you must think and wonder/ Why I drink 40s and memorize BusLink numbers/ Well, I don't have a license, but I'm tryna gain prominence/ 'Cause I'm living in a house with a fridge full of condiments."" And in case it's not clear, Cadence knows genre-- ""old school new school need to know this,"" as it were-- impressively adapting his flow to production and even playing with the anachronisms: 80s throwback on ""Falco vs. Starfox"" is paid in full when Cadence flat-out pokeballs. (And for the record, my friend who's the best at Smash Brothers is better than your friend who's the best at Smash Brothers.)

Here we get the most definite hint that Cadence, as a listener, devours most everything. Is the Black Hand puts Cadence's best feats forward, but his extremely varied musical interests seem to hold him back from developing a cohesive on-mic personality-- no callings cards, let along overarching concerns or worldview, even when showing his hand on pregnant heartbreaking closer, ""Julie Will Jump the Broom"".

Palm Reader,ZZZZ,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab52c0084474cd0c1358/1:1/w_160/5641edee.jpg,2005-03-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8962-palm-reader/,Polyvinyl,"The saxophone-- unless played with the utmost restraint-- is the crying-baby-in-a-movie-theater of musical instruments. You've got your bag of popcorn and enormous Sierra Mist, feet propped up on the cup holders, the teenagers behind you scolded into tentative silence-- basically, you're all settled in, when a brassy squeal jars you out of your trance and makes you painfully jab your inner cheek with your straw. And that stain in your lap better be ""buttery topping"" that leaked through that bag there, hair-trigger. Steve Sostak's alto-sax playing is adept but hardly restrained, a moot point given that Palm Reader is an entire theater full of wailing infants. Stosak formed ZZZZ (pronounced ""chk-chk-chk""-- just kidding, I think it's ""zeez"") after his sax-laden post-rock band Sweep the Leg Johnny disbanded, enlisting his former group's bassist John Brady, classically trained electric pianist Ellen Bunch, and former Tekulvi drummer Greg Sharp. Those of you who've ever wondered what a cross between Drums and Tuba, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and Fiery Furnaces might sound like are some kind of damn weirdoes: Who sits around wondering what different combinations of bands would sound like? Well, here's your answer anyway. The Drums and Tuba comparison is especially salient, except that ZZZZ eschews D&T;'s varied moods and keeps the pedal to the metal. It's all wildly swerving, vaguely Eastern European math rock with delay-drenched horns and keys waltzing across rumbling rhythms and dipping into swampy Cajun jazz, jaunty swing music, neckerchiefed gypsy dirges, and demented Klezmer rhythms. There's a giant accordion-shaped hole in the album, but during its better moments-- such as the sultry bass phrase that weaves through ""Bandit King & Queen""-- one is thankful for its absence: Already trembling on the brink of kitsch, accordion might have shoved Palm Reader right over the edge. The Fiery Furnaces influence finds purchase in the theatrical feint and parry of Sostak's and Bunch's vocals. They add some nice rhythmic accents to the lean swirls of ""2nd Hand Smoke"", but don't do much for the stammering stomp of ""Forget It"" and mar the middle stretch of ""Assassination Polka"" with some squirrelly scatting. On an album that's already busy, the prudence of adding two panting, slithering voices is sometimes questionable, especially as they try on campy inflections like costume jewelry. Now, this is the part where savvy readers are eyeing the band's name and waiting for the inevitable, obvious joke. No dice-- thrilling and exasperating by turns, Palm Reader is never anything short of (over-?)stimulating, its soporific powers on par with caffeine pills or Baby's First Movie.","Polyvinyl issues this overstimulated album spearheaded by a pair of former Sweep the Leg Johnny members.

Good Fortune,Airborn Audio,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bcb1335d7bf1698325/1:1/w_160/0885dc78.jpg,2005-03-23 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/472-good-fortune/,Ninja Tune,"When Anti-Pop Consortium split in 2001, a lot of folks cried into their backpacks. After all, this was a group that dismissed both commercial jig and the underground's nostalgia obsession. Their Arrhythmia LP bursted with creativity, and its singularity seemed like it would be difficult to top. Former APC member Beans has since shown flashes (tempted to say, ""given whiffs"") of creativity in reinventing himself as the underground's ass-shaker eccentric, but Kool Keith still sits comfortably atop that throne. APC's other members, High Priest and M. Sayyid, have made less racket in the interim. Releasing solo singles and two preemptive mixtapes, Priest and Sayyid held steady while preparing their debut as Airborn Audio. With Good Fortune, they return to the more experimental ideas on APC's Tragic Epilogue-- and echo some of that album's monotony. On the opening moments of ""Miami/The Jungle"", Sayyid rhymes over a boiling synth bass only to be halted by Priest demanding that he ""spit something hotter."" Sayyid's response is an interpolation of an old Snoop lyric. That offhanded humor hints at the album's underlying problem: Sayyid and Priest don't sound like they're sure what they're doing. The production is lazy, sounding like A.R.E. Weapons leftovers most of the time. Lyrically, they veer closer to the clichéd topics of hip-hop battle rhyming than the abstract intellectualism of past mindbenders. The hooks also stumble, lacking the originality of APC classics like the absurd ""We Kill Soap Scum"". Instead, we get, ""I'ma fuck you up this year/ Don't come around here,"" from M. Sayyid on ""This Year"". Seriously? Can I get a ""Silver Heat"", please? How about a ""MEGA/MEGA/MEGAAAAAA!!!!""? No? One thing that becomes clear after listening to this LP is Beans was APC's hookman. He may have been a megalomaniacal pain in the ass, but dude stirred the pot. There's not a single moment on Good Fortune that rivals anything that the three together produced on Arrhythmia-- or any of their other material, for that matter. I tried not to compare the two groups, but Priest and Sayyid claim in interviews that Airborn Audio is a continuation of the Anti-Pop movement, a return to form. ""Tragic Epilogue '05,"" says Priest. It's tragic. It's an epilogue. It's 2005. I guess, technically, he was in the pocket. It's even more frustrating when compared to the material on last year's Close Encounters: The Mixtape, which was supposedly a teaser for the full-length. On the mixtape, the duo sounded hungry, rhyming over noticeably non-APC production. The snippets were bloated with grimy synth-encrusted street beats that borrowed knowingly from everything from Hollertronix to Dipset's anthems. It wasn't abstract. It wasn't groundbreaking. But, it was good. It made me think that Good Fortune would be an ugly, gritty reclamation of the worldwide underground. Instead, the pressure of resurrecting APC shackled them to a tired sound. Where the low profile of the mixtape allowed them to let loose, the spotlight on the Airborn Audio project over the last year-and-a-half seems to have provoked a backslide. Here's the deal with taking a step back; you better be damn sure everyone else is still standing where you left them. They're not? Shit. The landscape is not the same as it was when Priest and Sayyid left. Killa Cam spills purple diamonds over opera vocals. Lil' Jon's scoring the apocalypse with terror-synths down in Atlanta. Swishahouse is screwin' and choppin' everything until the streets run red with the 'Tussin. And don't even get started on the juggernaut that is grime. And that's just what's on the radio. Whether hip-hop would sound the way it does today without APC is arguable (probably not), but the APC sound isn't as avant-garde as it was three years ago. And the slight tweaks of that sound on Good Fortune aren't enough to keep pace with current frontrunners. If you want to hear what Airborn Audio might eventually sound like, get the mixtape and maybe Sayyid and Priest's solo 12""s on Sound-Ink. ","Former Anti-Poppers High Priest and M. Sayyid try to echo the sound of their previous group.

Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard,Hella,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c14713d197565213bb92/1:1/w_160/59a49adb.jpg,2005-03-23 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11757-church-gone-wildchirpin-hard/,Suicide Squeeze,"Sometimes the best way to succeed in music is by pretending you're already the biggest band in the world. Hella, a Sacramento guitar/drums duo whose music elicited little more than a shoulder shrug and a ""meh"" from most listeners, confidently put the cart before the horse with Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard. Borrowing the Speakerboxxx/The Love Below format, the epic double-solo album is the band's third and most extensive full-length, capturing virtuosos Zach Hill and Spencer Seim at their creative and technical apex. So Zach's got Church, Spencer has Chirpin', and the two albums couldn't steer freak-out rock in more disparate directions. Seim's crowning moments thrive on electro-pop/noise synergy; as a result, Church feels a bit homogenous and redundant when juxtaposed to Chirpin'-- which is no surprise considering Hill initially composed the disc as one hour-long song. Still, on numbers like ""I'm Quitting the Cult"" and ""Wish I Never Saw a White Man"", Hill's metronome goes haywire as he pulverizes the skins at Mach speed, a change of pace from other tracks on which he merely bludgeons them at 220 bpm. To top it off, Hill throws in fuzzed-out vox, hellraising guitar sounds, chilling church organ, and any other instrument appropriate for the apocalypse. Seim's response? A soundtrack for a chaotic NES game that never existed. The part-time Advantage drummer uses that band's covers as prototypes for his own twisted form of Nintendo-rock. Chirpin' employs Hella's traditionally linear song sequencing to enhance the disc's narrative quality. Opener ""Gold Mine, Gold Yours"" is exactly the song I'd expect after pushing the NES power button, ""Famnail"" conjures up that impossibly long level I could never beat, and ""Home on the Arrange"" menaces like so many Mega Man bosses. Even more impressive is Seim's channeling of NES pathos; just as Bowser simultaneously appears intimidating and ridiculous, Seim's songwriting evokes a healthy balance of fear and lightheartedness. And oh yeah, those 8-bit beeps and squelches are mostly acoustic instruments slickly altered to resemble digital sine waves. Naturally, the double-album's peaks occur when both members' ideas intersect. ""Song From Uncle"" fuses Church's proactive percussion with Seim's buoyant songwriting. Likewise, Seim's guitar playfully mimics Hill's nihilistic vocals on ""Imaginary Friends"", Church's closest stab at melody. With these moments, Hella back up their ambition with impressive amounts of ingenuity and elbow grease, creating a White Album for disgruntled Gen Xers still finding solace in shoeboxes full of NES cartridges.

Picaresque,The Decemberists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e9ea9e61561daa5928/1:1/w_160/fb547b87.jpg,2005-03-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2243-picaresque/,Kill Rock Stars,"Re-sleeve that album cover! Disregard those silly liner-note photographs! Never you mind the Decemberists' attempts at theatricality-- Picaresque is the band's least stagy, most serious, and most accomplished effort yet. It's also as good a follow-up to Her Majesty the Decemberists any devoted fan could hope for. On that previous effort, head insurgent Colin Meloy proclaimed, ""I was meant for the stage,"" and indeed the songs sounded like production numbers performed by eager actors in a cramped playhouse. That album still retains its considerable charm, but the Decemberists sounded less like a band than a traveling troupe at the behest of fickle royalty. Picaresque easily dispels such limitations. Here, as he plaintively proclaims on ""The Engine Driver"", Meloy is ""a writer, a writer of fictions."" As its title suggests, the album collects a compendium's worth of well-crafted story-songs, most of which sound more literary than theatrical (the nearly nine-minute ""Mariner's Revenge Song"" excepted). In other words, the Decemberists are no longer the indie rock version of the Max Fischer Players; these songs are content to be songs, not one-acts, and the music is music, not sonic scenery. As a result, Picaresque sounds similar to Castaways and Cutouts and their live shows: The music is more dynamic and all the more evocative for not attempting to romantically conjure the past and filter it through Meloy's imagination. Despite some historical backdrops, most of these narratives are set in the here and now, a milieu that suits the band very well. The spring in the band's collective step here may be somewhat aided by Chris Walla's crisp production, but I imagine it's mostly the achievement of the band itself, who sharpened their teeth on last year's mini-LP The Tain and now tend to Meloy's songs like bodyguards trotting alongside the presidential limousine. Chris Funk packs an arsenal of exotic instruments, brandishing his bouzouki, hurdy-gurdy, and dulcimer like firearms, and Rachel Blumberg, in her farewell performance (she has left to concentrate on her band Norfolk and Western) proves a capable foil for Meloy, her voice blending nicely with his on ""From My One True Love (Lost at Sea)"" and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"". She also adds thunderous momentum to the opening ""The Infanta"", a heartbreak pulse to the quieter parts of ""On the Bus Mall"", and an athletic shuffle to ""The Sporting Life"", and her hi-hat decorates ""We Both Go Down Together"" like jewels on a lover's necklace. In developing into such a formidable flock, the Decemberists not only have far outstripped those ridiculous comparisons to Neutral Milk Hotel that dogged Her Majesty, but have also allowed Meloy to widen his lyrical scope and hone his ambitious narratives. He remains enamored with tawny historical verisimilitudes, which inform the devastating ""Eli, the Barrow Boy"", ""The Infanta"", and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" (the latter of which, legend has it, was recorded live around a single mic). But much of his chosen subject matter sounds startlingly contemporary, even if these songs still confront the familiar theme of impossible love. A cousin to Belle and Sebastian's ""The Stars of Track & Field"", ""The Sporting Life"" views the roaring crowds, disapproving parents, unfaithful girlfriend, and disappointed coach from the vantage of an averse athlete lying injured on the field, and ""The Bagman's Gambit"" conjures a compromised U.S. government, a D.C. where everyone is for sale, as a backdrop for the story of a government official in love with a spy. Meloy's acoustic guitar is delicate here, while the band churns a car-chase momentum climaxing in a nightmarish freakout that sounds like Manchurian Candidate dementia triggered by ""A Day in the Life"". Perhaps the best song he's written, ""On the Bus Mall"" is Meloy's own private Idaho full of boy gigolos amok in the city, and he evocatively contrasts their innocent affection (""Here in our hovel we fused like a family"") with the grittiness of their lives: ""You learned quick to make a fast buck/ In bathrooms and barrooms, on dumpsters and heirlooms/ We bit our tongues/ Sucked our lips into our lungs 'til we were falling/ Such was our calling."" The one standout, the apple among the oranges, is ""16 Military Wives"", which on first listen doesn't seem to fit the Picaresque aesthetic. It's not a story, but a protest song that uses a slick horn line and Meloy's loosest vocals yet (I distinctly hear a ""whoo!"") to tally the mathematics of war-- plus dollars, minus lives. But it's the sequencing that allows Meloy to work this aside into the album's larger mission: Following ""To My Own True Love (Lost at Sea)"", about futilely awaiting a lover's return, it becomes clear that the narrator could be one of the ""five military wives"" left widowed by ""14 cannibal kings"" while ""15 pristine moderate liberal minds"" look on helplessly. This is a new side of the Decemberists: angry, impassioned, and more in touch with the world than ever. ","The Decemberists may have built their rep on historical backdrops and quaint theatricality, but their third full-length trades much of that in for more ambitious narratives and dynamic playing. Picaresque captures the band in peak form, packing in exotic instrumentation that creates a lush and evocative backdrop to Colin Meloy's story-songs, which here are more colorful-- and more topical-- than ever.

The Singles,Basement Jaxx,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b7c0084474cd0bfc3c/1:1/w_160/1b1726a4.jpg,2005-03-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/574-the-singles/,XL,"Collective jaws (okay, two) dropped at my workplace when it was revealed Basement Jaxx were free agents in the U.S. Could Astralwerks really be that stupid? How much coke did Radio 4 need? What sort of stygian rider clauses did the Air contract contain? Did Stormin' Norman have nekkid pitchers of their mama to get them to put out Palookaville? Though they never moved Chems-at-their-height numbers, I had assumed the Jaxx would have been one of the label's best sellers. Yet Astralwerks never seemed to know how to market a studio duo with a revolving cast of singers and players to a personality-ravenous U.S. audience. To date, no Basement Jaxx album has sold 40k in the states. This can't be blamed entirely on the suits. Unlike in England and continental Europe, disco did die here, and it's been a long, estranged trip for dance acts ever since. We Americans generally like our dance music subsumed into a singer, even if that singer is Rick Astley. From their inception, Basement Jaxx have been a house act reconciling with song, and it's been a rather protracted process. They toyed with Afro-Brazilian hoo-hah for a good few years before they started mashing up ragga, noise, punk, and R&B; in a Brixton sardine tin. Their 1999 debut Remedy seemed an unexpected explosion of fecundity from sorry old house music, but it was the result of five years in the lab. And it was only on 2003's Kish Kash that they finally, fully embraced verse/chorus/verse structures. It won them a Grammy, but it may have been too late. Even in England, dance music feels all but dead, as fragmented and niche-oriented as that late-80s moment before house. The choice the Jaxx now seem to face is between fully embracing pop (as producers, though Felix Buxton has a lovely singing voice), or retreating to the safety (and reduced vision) of dance. Which is a fucking shame, because their essential tension (and what makes The Singles, a best-of that substitutes for their bi-yearly new album this year, so great) is between dancefloor compulsive repetition and hook-crammed P-O-P. The obvious point of comparison is P-Funk, and indeed Brother George lords over the whole B.Jaxx project like a spirit guide. He's most audible on opener ""Red Alert"" from 1999: hollow, metallic slap bass, temple-wincing g-funk synths, chanted nonsense, Big Bertha Butt vocals. The Jaxx had done funky, noisy, and slick before, but this was the first time they didn't portion them out like Weight Watchers, one sound per single. It helped that you couldn't see the joins. ""Jump'n'Shout"" was ragga-house that barely overlapped with UK garage. You can see guest Slarta John's eyeball veins throbbing, his vocals all but gobbing at you, as the boys play acid like they were Ron Asheton. This is the kind of stuff-- along with the 20,000 leagues fuzz-bass of ""Yo-Yo""-- that pinned the ""punk garage"" badge to their knapsack, both insult and perverse identification. So they decided to keep ratcheting things up, knowing full well Phuture didn't title one single ""Rise From Your Grave"" because they wanted their music to soundtrack khaki sales. ""Where's Your Head At?"" listened to Gary Numan and heard Slade, doom metal, and disco simultaneously. ""Plug It In"" reanimated Bonzo to play boy band R&B; on oil drums filled with fulminative mercury. Maybe I'm just broken, but I can't hear this song and not hear a hit. Not a Timberlake-sized hit (don't be silly), but still a hit. And they were never just for the lads; there's always been a slightly belittled girly side to the Jaxx. ""Jus 1 Kiss"" is twilight disco motion; that moment when the chorus soars as the groove kicks in is as swoonworthy as anything else in house. ""Romeo"" is R&B; played a little too fast, speed-bossa with the most nape-tingling bridge of the 21st century. And ""Do Your Thing"" is just good old-fashioned gay-as-fuck piano barreling house. Somehow I don't think they're displeased this wound up as interstitial music in every other Queer Eye episode. If you think brassy disco is old hat, you're probably too straight for you own good. The second disc pales slightly, but that's a bit like saying David pales compared to the Sistine Chapel. Jaxx B-sides are generally heads and shoulders, knees and toes above 95% of electronic dance A-sides. ""Bongoloid""-- with a dreamy intro, clanking groove, bubbling raggas, and Smurfette intrusion-- is worthy of their albums as well as a guaranteed floor killer. (Why do you think they'd risk that just-this-side-of-cheesy ""wave your hands in the air"" part?) ""Mere Pass"" samples the Modern Lovers' ""Egyptian Reggae"" (!) and sneaks a peek into a studio collab between Asha Bhosle and Eiffel 65, Bollywood Baeleric. ""Magnificent Romeo"" is an official version of Soulwax's Clash mash-up, nearly as good as the originals. Not so sure about the live ""Good Luck"" (without accompanying visuals) or superfluous acoustic ""Romeo"" (though less superfluous than the acoustic ""One More Time""), but they make more sense on a party disc than than Dillinja's (thankfully missing) collapsed ""Lucky Star"", featuring hands down the ugliest bassline of all time. If you're wondering what's keeping this from its 10.0, there are a few (very) minor quibbles. It's missing at least one major single, the grinding, square-wave raunchfest ""Get Me Off"". (Which out-Peaches Peaches and which Janet Jackson should have wisely accepted when offered.) It's missing a few crucial B-sides, like the Oh-the-Humanity hailstorm of ""Razocaine"". Plus, the nature of a singles collection obviously means you lose out on the quirky asides-- no ""Living Room""-- that make the albums so charming. But still, here are 15 Top 40 hits (and six certifiable number 1's) from a more just universe while we settle for Kenny Chesney. Basement Jaxx may wind up selling white labels out of a Yugo in Zagreb, but they already made ""Good Luck"", which is what those Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Awards are for.","Electronic dance music maximalists Basement Jaxx substitute their bi-yearly new album with this career-spanning singles collection, which features two new tracks and a second disc of B-sides, highlighting the tension between their compulsive dancefloor repetition and hook-crammed pop.

Imperial f.f.r.r.,Unrest,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ec9d034d5c69bf3b6c/1:1/w_160/b4f4eb8c.jpg,2005-03-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8362-imperial-ffrr/,TeenbeatTeenbeat,"One of the cooler things about the Great Halcyon Days of College Radio (say, 1987-93) was the number of different camps populating the underground. You had your hardcore kids, punks, and skate rats big on yelling and beer, skeptical of synths and Englishmen. You had your goths and art school kids, big on keyboards and eyeliner. And you had your tweedy collegiate types, the ones with their hands on the radio transmitters, and who made (sm)arty-pants indie-rock their reigning sound. It was that audience that took Unrest up as a flagship, making them loom as large as Pavement, Hal Hartley, and David Foster Wallace in the mid-90s college-sophomore canon. Super-minimalist pop, cloudy atmosphere, trans-Atlantic cool, and obscure obsessions like Cath Carroll and Isabel Bishop: Nothing seemed to fit quite as well with design courses and corduroy. Design types, after all, have that thing about minimalism, and this band's stark, elegant sound could strip things down to a strikingly small number of moving parts-- some kind of warm, detailed dream of the indie-rock group as postmodern 50s pop combo. This reissue of 1992's Imperial f.f.r.r. demonstrates where Unrest, formerly a scattershot pseudo-punk outfit, became that version of itself-- an art-pop guitar band drawing incredibly simple lines. If the story of this group is that of frontman Mark Robinson gradually admitting he might rather be an English kid from the early 80s, well, their EP of Factory Records covers may be the coming-out party, but this is where it counts. The first attraction is the sound of their big ecstatic pop songs, which feel as crisp and joyous as ever: ""Suki"" rushes along on clean guitar jangle and Robinson's coy babble (no one's ever sounded so good just repeating the word ""kicking""), and ""Cherry Cream On"", an even coyer come-on, is still the record's standout blast. Come to this reissue looking for that pop rush, though, and you'll barely get an EP's worth of what you want-- even counting the eight bonus tracks. Because no matter how easy it is to remember Unrest as a racing pop act (""Cath Carroll"", ""Make Out Club""), the fact is that they were starker and artier than that, and the scattershot experiments of their early releases can still be heard fading into this one. The first track is just the test tone used for mastering, and around its edges you get just as many art pieces: Here a collage of beats, bells, and bass; there a pattern of feedback bouncing between speakers. But those are the poles: The actual core of this album is stark, warm, and elegantly simple, and it's in that space that Unrest wound up doing their most interesting work. The title track, for instance, is just a slow, chiming guitar run and one of Robinson's awkward choir-boy vocals; a 14-minute variant among the bonus tracks strips it down even further. The album version of ""Isabel"" is similar, just acoustic guitar and a careful chorus harmony; it was the 12"" version, included here, that fleshed it out into a college radio hit, sounding something like indie-pop trip-hop. ""June"", one of the band's best-ever tracks, glides smoothly along on just bass, drums, and bassist Bridget Cross's vocals, then fleshes it out into a harmonized wash that's a blueprint for the post-Unrest Air Miami project. There are plenty of skips around that sound-- they're something like Crispy Ambulance fans on ""Loyola"", something like Krautrock devotees on the bonus ""Hydrofoil One"". But on a track like ""I Do Believe You Are Blushing"", it sounds absolutely pure: They seem to have whittled down American indie-rock into some variant that feels as lush and dreamy as English post-rock, and you start to see how a guitar-based three-piece from DC could share fans with acts like Stereolab, share UK label-space with the Cocteau Twins, and cover both new wave obscurities like the Family Fodder and indie pop prototypes like Miaow. The trick is to see Unrest for what they were: A pop band that didn't often play pop songs. There's always that rushing, radio-friendly jangle, yes. But the bulk of their work-- both here and on the even more accessible Perfect Teeth-- was a lot more stylized than that, and the oddly dreamy pop sound they sketched out tends to be unique enough to inspire devotion. Imperial's littered with tracks you'll wind up skipping; even with those eight bonuses (more prototypes and variants than anything else), I can only whittle it down to a nine-song Perfect Album. But when it's worth it, it kills: This stuff is pure style, and unlike just about anything around it.","Expanded reissue of the early 1990s indie classic.

Black Forest,A-Frames,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bb5e6ef9596932025f/1:1/w_160/72d8d7be.jpg,2005-03-22 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/471-black-forest/,Sub Pop,"A-Frames foresee the end of the world, and they seem to relish it. On ""Black Forest II"", drummer/vocalist Lars Finberg enumerates Armageddon's casualties with a hint of contented zeal: ""No people, no trucks, no cars/ No movies, no TV stars/ Humanity is erased/ Black Forest left in its place."" Sure, it's a bit heavy-handed, but musically they keep it short and sweet: The best of Black Forest's 14 tracks are usually a done deal 'ere the two-minute bell strikes. Actually, the album would be better if it, too, was kept on the short side. Like fellow dystopia-dwellers Liars and Fire Show, A-Frames prefer a sustained din to an expansive roar. Black Forest tends to drone, which is okay when A-Frames remember to bring the riffs. Among the songs that include a melodic counterpoint to the band's combination of jaundiced electronics and sludgy bass is ""Experiment"", which waits for the pitch then slugs it into the bleachers with a flick-of-the-wrist guitar hook. ""Galena"" pounds a see-sawing bass/drums vamp before breaking form to deliver a brusque but satisfying chorus. Throughout its exciting yet repetitive first half, such well-placed, melodious turnabouts are Black Forest's saving grace-- they affirm the album's aesthetic by temporarily breaking with it. Those breaks aren't as prevalent on the LP's brooding second side. Starting with ""Quantum Mechanics"", the album sounds like an undeveloped skeleton of its first half. ""Memoranda"" is muted, stiff, and lacks the gorilla low-end that buttresses even the band's weakest numbers. ""Negative"" carries far too much bass racket and comes off like malcontent Icarus Line. On Side B, only ""My Teacher""-- with its tick-tock bass line, mottled spoken-word lyrics, and almost-dub clicks and rolls-- interrupts the clangor. ""Age of Progress""-- the second set's strongest track-- follows, and it's both the dankest, dirtiest thing A-Frames have ever recorded and an interesting sound for them to explore in the future. At their best, A-Frames evoke a half-digested Pop Group. (They spared themselves the other half to leave room for melody.) This approach could take off if the band keeps sight of the details and don't let its songs linger. But here A-Frames teeter on the line between consistency and monotony, falling mostly on the former side-- their endless doomsaying can grow tiresome but more often it's fun to play along. Even perdition can seem appealing when it's paired with a killer hook or two.","Sub Pop dystopia-dwellers keep things crisp and frequently melodic.

I'm no prophet, but it didn't take a genius, either. Thank you, sweet spirits. Amen starts out remarkably like their debut: with a song so upbeat and catchy, you can hardly help but get excited. ""One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces"" is a portrayal of an anonymous guy who nobody liked in school, but is now ""big and important"" and laughing in all their faces. Folds claims it's not about him. Right. As for the album as a whole, it's pretty decent, though there are an overwhelming quantity of mediocre ballads here and only a few good ones. Luckily, the occasional upbeat tunes are just as impressive as ever. If Folds could stick to his happier times, I'd be happier, too.","My prediction of Ben Folds Five's debut album was astonishingly accurate. A year later, BF5 have accumulated something like ...

Arular,M.I.A.,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c52ec0084474cd0c36ba/1:1/w_160/ce3d846c.jpg,2005-03-22 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5618-arular/,XLBeggars,"Arular was first expected to be released in late 2004, but instead M.I.A. gave half of its vocals away to Diplo's Piracy Funds Backlash mixtape, which married her London Sri Lankan patois to music from New York, Rio, and Kingston. The mix highlighted her big-tent approach to global rhythms and Now Sounds, an M.O. that was cemented when she professed her love for hip-hop crew the Diplomats and rap's spiritual cousins, grime, baile funk, dancehall, and reggaeton in The New York Times. Faster than you can say ""galang-alang-alang,"" M.I.A. became the one-woman embodiment of what to some is great about the contemporary pop music landscape. All that's left is for M.I.A. to draft Seba as producer and that voice that name-stamps dancehall tracks like a heavily drugged, vocoded Just Blaze as MC: ""M.I.A. on... Bionic Ras... Baile Funk... Forward Riddim..."" This transglobal express isn't new, of course: Young Jamaicans have been combining the best of U.S. hip-hop and UK dance culture for years, American rap producers seem addicted to the sub-continent, grime is actually lobbing singles into the UK top 40, and Nigeria is threatening to become the new hip-hop hot spot. ""From ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard, taking it transglobal on the aboveground, because that's where the people are,"" Hyperdub's Sterling Clover said of this trend a few years ago. At the time he was talking about bhangra and the Indian influences on hip-hop, but he could just as easily have been talking about dancehall or grime or baile funk. And when it comes to M.I.A., you can practically talk about all of them at once. Unlike most musical tailors, neither she nor her mixtape partner Diplo is afraid to let the seams show. Rather than hiding up the ass of cratedigging culture, they relish sharing the spotlight with and revealing their sources, with M.I.A. dropping names in NYC broadsheets and Diplo opening two-way routes between Philly and the favelas rather than stashing all the best dubplates for himself. Northern Soul is probably turning over in its grave. If the two are interested in creating a dialogue between different artists and sounds, they're also more than happy to allow listeners to eavesdrop, whether they're improvising (Piracy) or well-rehearsed (Arular, Favela on Blast). M.I.A.'s freedom-through-homelessness is shared by other artists (most notably dj/Rupture) but not by many of the source sounds found on her records, most of which are fiercely regional. Where Rupture's name suggests a destruction of the borders between scenes, cultures, and nations, his methods-- which include healthy doses of splatter beats and breakcore-- can also seem violently deconstructionist. M.I.A's moniker, on the other hand, appropriately suggests rootlessness. She's not exploring subcultures so much as visiting them, grabbing souvenirs and laying them out on acetate: The favela trumpet on ""Bucky Done Gone"", the London slang of ""Galang"", the disco sample on ""Sunshowers"", the steel drums of ""Bingo"", the electro-fueled vocal edits of ""Hombre"". M.I.A.'s detractors claim her flirtations with terrorism and revolutionary politics reveal the biggest case of sufferer's envy since Joe Strummer but little depth of thought. But if the latter is true, so what? An in-depth examination of demonizing The Other, the relationship between the West and developing nations, or the need to empathize with one's enemies would likely make for a pretty crappy pop song. An argument can and has been made that her political lip service is unique enough to get those topics onto your tongue or into your brain, prodding listeners to at least examine them. Some might find that off-putting, but pop music that reflects uncomfortable realities and is packaged in this sonic collage beats the hell out of 1980s left-wing hand wringing from Bragg or Bono or Biafra. And when it comes down to it, that ""sonic collage"" is still what's important here. With all the column inches and message board posts arguing about whether M.I.A. is an opportunist or a clever contextualist, genuine or a fraud, full of good intentions or no specific intentions at all, the closest thing to a truism about Arular is that it's a taut, invigorating distillation of the world's most thrilling music; a celebration of contradictions and aural globalization that recasts the tag ""world music"" as the ultimate in communicative pop rather than a symbol of condescending piety.","After her much-loved Piracy Funds Terrorism mixtape collaboration with Diplo, and a series of delays, the debut album from London-via-Sri Lanka club artist M.I.A. proves worth the wait.

Pony Up!,Pony Up!,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18aea9e61561daa481b/1:1/w_160/b5a8b1ab.jpg,2005-03-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6560-pony-up/,Dim Mak,"My nephew calls me ""Fifty,"" not because he thinks I'm a swollen bullet receptacle, but because that's how old he thinks I am. I'm not 50, despite some piss-poor toddler judgment, and my nephew got a pile of bricks for Christmas last year, courtesy Unka P. I'm also not 16. I am old enough to remember Liz Phair's Stones rebuttal and Juliana Hatfield's sugary confessions. As a young lad, they were among the quiet riot girls who shaped my post-pubescent view of female empowerment. At the time, I wondered why the girls I knew couldn't be more like these wise, wisecracking, and casually confident women. The answer was, and is, that 99% percent of teenagers, male or female, won't acquire these traits for a good decade. Not that Pony Up! are a bunch of teens, but their music exudes a bratty naiveté-- a mix of soda-pop psychology and the Shaggs after a few rigorous lessons-- that makes it difficult to stomach for more than a couple of listens. Much of their self-titled debut comes across as a weekend project between a group of friends, and the band's bio does little to refute that. The members are two sisters, the sisters' brother's ex-girlfriend, one of the sister's ex-bandmates, and the sisters' brother's ex-girlfriend's former co-worker. Degrassi, anyone? They all got together, made a demo for shits and giggles, and ended up giving it to Ben Lee at one of his shows. Lee, another champion of teenage angsty jangle pop, heard kindred spirits and signed the band to his imprint. However, Lee isn't doing anyone a favor, least of all Pony Up!, by releasing what amounts to a half-assed demo. Pony Up! have done their homework on early-90's indie pop like Phair and Hatfield, but their sound is eerily similar to cult-faves Cub and Tiger Trap, whose loose-limbed lo-fi told similar coming-of-age stories. Cub and Tiger Trap also didn't last very long. The major difference between those artists and Pony Up! is that the latter's simplistic odes lack the knowing smirk of their predecessors. Pony Up!'s lyrics are sonic defense mechanisms, deploying humor to avoid confronting any real emotion. I'm all for jokes; they're funny. But, the girls sprint over the tipping point with the first song they ever recorded, ""Matthew Modine"", a dirty note passed to an 80s semi-icon. Okay, mini-icon. I love Vision Quest. There, I said it. Elsewhere, PU! make up some ground with catchy, gloomy pop but even then, it's not the hooks that stick with you-- it's the self-defeating lyrics. ""Minstrel"" and ""Shut Up and Kiss Me"" have their moments, but when a line like ""my brother and sister are going to beat you up"" follows an honest sentiment like ""you are all my fault,"" someone needs to tell these girls to cut the crap. I nominate Ben Lee. He started it.","Montreal-based indie poppers issue their lo-fi debut.

Living Contact,Christina Carter,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73113d1975652139361/1:1/w_160/d1cdfbd1.jpg,2005-03-21 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1800-living-contact/,Kranky,"For more than a decade, Christina Carter has explored the farthest indistinct reaches of the psych-folk cosmos as a member of Texas' Charalambides, a duo and/or trio whose haunting, emotionally charged creations possess such a highly personalized air of intimacy that it almost seems superfluous to further isolate their sound into its individual constituent parts. Nevertheless, Living Contact consists of home recordings that Carter created between 1994-98 using nothing more than acoustic guitar and the occasional trace of intuitive vocal. Shorn of Charalambides partner Tom Carter's often-turbulent electric psych textures, Carter burrows deeper into the fertile soil of American folk to fashion simple works whose mesmerizing, out-of-time splendor tidily anticipated several subsequent free-folk adventures. Recorded on boombox and originally released in a limited-edition CD-R pressing on the Charalambides' Wholly Other imprint, Living Contact is heavy with tape hiss, false starts, and abrupt endings, and couldn't feel any more intimate if you were a spider on Carter's ceiling. Although as a guitarist Christine lacks the technical virtuosity of such contemporary John Fahey acolytes as Glenn Jones or Jack Rose, on pieces like the opening ""Silhouette"" or ""Dream Mother"" she utilizes an elliptical finger-picking style as she works her stark melodies carefully and methodically, as if turning through the fragile pages of an ancient, inscrutable book. At points during the 14-minute epic ""Alone, Not Alone"" her circular, minimalist repetitions recall the more experimental primitive stylings of German guitarist Steffen Basho-Junghans, and become so hypnotic that it always comes as a something of a startling jolt when she at last begins singing. When Carter chooses to use her voice, it's translucent and otherworldly, with her lyrics a gauzy, practically wordless stream of secretive exhalations. The literal meaning of her words clearly bears less importance than their placement, best evident on the track ""Going Down"", when the sole whispered phrase ""I'll go down"" fractures the song's placid surface as a single thrown stone into a tranquil lake, which leads into an extended fade-out as her guitar frantically kicks and splashes. As pleasing as Living Contact is, however, one can't help but be left with the nagging suspicion that there could be acres of such material lurking in Carter's closets. And though this album does rank as one of the most starkly pretty items in the extended Charalambides catalog, it doesn't aspire to the ambitious, transcendent levels of the full group's best work, and seems destined to appeal primarily to the faithful diehards who (understandably) cherish Carter's every move.","Charalambide releases a collection of home recordings created between 1994-98.

B-Sides and Rarities,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a569c0084474cd0c06f3/1:1/w_160/93ad5a28.jpg,2005-03-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1372-b-sides-and-rarities/,Mute,"Most rarities compilations are chockablock with inferior alternate takes, half-assed covers, one-off soundtrack contributions, dead-end experiments, and tracks that were left off proper albums for good reason. Compiled by Bad Seed Mick Harvey, B-Sides and Rarities contains all of those things from every dark corner of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' 20-plus year career, but it still proves a better retrospective than the equally matter-of-factly titled The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. This discrepancy might be surprising, but coming from the Aussie boogeyman and his henchmen, it seems perfectly fitting, perhaps even inevitable. Since his days with the Birthday Party, Cave has nurtured an almost academic obsession with the underbelly of society and the basest of human urges, populating his songs with murderers, rapists, and rogues doing their God-appointed jobs and arguing moral issues as justification. So it's wholly appropriate that the underbelly of Cave's own career should itself be so fascinating. Those characters stake their claim to the first two disks, especially the tracks culled from the eras of The First Born Is Dead and Murder Ballads. ""Scum"" is a kiss-off to a ""fuckin' traitor, chronic masturbator, shitlicker, user, self-abuser"" who apparently had the temerity to give Cave a bad review. Cave revives the beauty-inspired killer of ""Where the Wild Roses Grow"", with Bad Seed Blixa Bargeld singing Kylie Minogue's part, and there are four installments of the ultraviolent ""O'Malley's Bar"". But the best murder ballad (even if it is a stretch to consider it as such) is ""(I'll Love You) Till the End of the World"" from the 1991 Wim Wenders film Until the End of the World. Cave's not a lunatic on a killing spree; he's a lovelorn bombmaker, and he caps this cinematic story of devotion with a spirited sing-along. As a writer and especially as a vocalist, Cave understands and appreciates the power of overstatement, and these seldom-heard rarities strike a resonant chord because they make no virtue of subtlety. Singing like he's Jesse Garon Presley, Cave writes the messages of ""God's Hotel"" and ""Jack the Ripper"" in all caps, bolded, underlined...in blood. As a result, the violence of his songs-- physical, moral, and emotional-- is all the more grotesque and haunting, and the three-disk format of B-Sides and Rarities gives him an enormous canvas for his scrawled screeds. It would be negligent, if not outright criminal, not to mention the Bad Seeds, who could very well be the focus of B-Sides and Rarities. Over the years they have proved themselves a remarkable and reliable backing band-- perhaps one of the best in rock history-- possessed of a dynamic range and intuitive sophistication without which Cave could not possibly achieve his lofty ambitions. The diversity of styles and moods they master over the course of these three disks is truly impressive, from the Sun Studio minimalism of the first three tracks to the lurching menace of ""Black Betty"" and ""King Kong Kitchee Kitchee Ki-Mi-O"", from the sinister soundtrack flourishes of ""Cocks and Asses"" and ""Red Right Hand (Scream 3 version)"" to the gentle restraint of Boatman's Call-era tracks like ""Black Hair (Band Version)"". In culling material for this compilation, Harvey consciously excluded any of Cave's solo work from the tracklist (only one song, the baroque ""Time Jesum Traseuntum Et Non Riverentum"" from the X-Files compilation, does not feature the Bad Seeds, although it does feature sometime Bad Seed Warren Ellis' band the Dirty Three). As a result, B-Sides and Rarities is as much the band's show as it is Cave's, which may be the key to this collection's dark sense of adventure.","Like it says on the tin: This 3xCD box collects the best of the Bad Seeds' non-LP work.

The Trip,Snow Patrol,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a218c0084474cd0bff7b/1:1/w_160/43338a11.gif,2005-03-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7306-the-trip/,Family,"""Light up, light up,"" head Snow Patroller Gary Lightbody beseeched your girlfriend, your sister, your grandmother last summer. As if they had a choice: When Coldplay's Radiohead-lite grandeur met Lou Barlow's emotional verisimilitude, Lightbody's opening slot for hoary arch-anthem-mongers U2 was assured. But now, a mixtape? Quick, you grab his legs while I mock his record collection! OK, so you noticed the number at the top of the page. Turns out Lightbody's entry for Family's The Trip series (previous participants: Dirty Vegas, Saint Etienne) had me-- if not your grandma-- at Sex in Dallas's ""Everybody Deserves to Be Fucked"". Does Keane listen to French electro-house, too? Didn't think so. Over two discs, ""Bert"" and ""Ernie"", Lightbody puts to plastic the stuff of his recent DJ (!) sets: chill-out electronica and indie, c. 2004. Notably absent: Barlow, Coldplay, My Bloody Valentine. In fact, Lightbody's Trip is best when it sounds more like Optimo's recent How to Kill the DJ [Part Two] than last year's Grandaddy-curated, Snow Patrol-featuring Below the Radio comp-- in other words, when it's more like the club than the arena. Most of Lightbody's dancier offerings are scattered throughout disc one, including the hilarious Sex in Dallas cut, Four Tet's typically organic ""Everything Is Alright"", and Mylo's Daft Punk-inflected ""Drop the Pressure"" (motherfucker!)-- plus, y'know, TV on the Radio (the single, natch). Lightbody closes the disc with the stylish jazz-pop of Feist's ""Mushaboom"". Even when Lightbody treads more expected ground-- the Shins, sometime Snow Patrol guitarist Iain Archer-- his picks are more likely to evoke his band's casual first two albums than last year's high-polish Final Straw. Make merry with Joy Zipper's dreamy ""Christmas Song"". Ponder where CocoRosie's bluesy number got those inane lyrics. Get shot up G-Unit-style (don't worry, it won't kill you) by Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum for remaining ambivalent toward Fiery Furnaces' ""Bow Wow"". Then wonder what a funk workout by Bill Withers has to do with any of this. If you read Pitchfork last year and did all your homework, little of The Trip will strike you as an epiphany. The tracks are illuminative if rarely breathtaking, and will likely yield most listeners a discovery or two. Then again, we've all put together mixtapes: Does Lightbody really like Deerhoof, or does he just want the girl from Brit Lit to think he does?","Northern Irish rockers curate the latest edition of this mix series.

The Waiting Room,Emanon,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd025e6ef95969322f83/1:1/w_160/363afda0.jpg,2005-03-20 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2920-the-waiting-room/,Shaman Work,"Remember that kid from your adolescent roughhouse scrambles? About average build, rocking the British Knights or Etonics, he was the ""all-around"" athlete you hated to guard: He'd box out effectively, hustle relentlessly, and played an unselfish, risk-free game. He sported that ""I'll dunk when it's worth three points"" No Fear tee. He loved the mid-90s Pacers and owned a shelf full of instructional videos. Like that guy, Emanon-- the L.A. duo DJ Exile and Aloe Blacc-- have made a career out of mastering the fundamentals. Singles such as ""Andyadontstop"" and ""Emcees Like Me"" evoke a toe tap or head bob, but never at the same time; Aloe Blacc's solo EP on Ipo Wax knocked but didn't bang. So, tame as it is, The Waiting Room is the closest they've come to rocking the proverbial boat. Lead single ""Count Your Blessings"" is a classic case of the group trying to step out of its shell but not succeeding. Sampling Sister Nancy is hardly audacious, but Exile makes do by pushing the punchy reverb on the horns while Aloe spits back-to-back numerical metaphors: ""All across the map in seven continents/ I'm the 8th wonder.../ Shoot em' out like 9mm gats/ All these wannabe cowboys with 10-gallon hats."" The title track also echoes their usual mix of somber, sun-setting, and slightly bouncy ritmo. But ""usual"" is the problem: Since their days on hand-passed mixtapes in the mid-90s, little has changed in either Aloe's benedictions or Exile's creations. Exile and Aloe do flex a bit down the stretch. ""She Thinks"" flaunts Aloe's pipes, previewing some of his future R&B; projects. And the barbershop nonsense on ""The World Don't Sing"" is a complete red herring. But The Waiting Room is wholly frustrating. Aloe is pointed and dexterous, but on the whole Emanon can't seem to step out of their SoCal bubble long enough to do something unique. They're like the Tim Duncan of hip-hop: Yeah, his game is well-rounded, and he gets the job done, but wouldn't you rather see Ron Artest eat a fan in the lower mezzanine?","L.A. hip-hop duo make a career of mastering the fundamentals.

10th Avenue Freakout,Fog,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde5ea9e61561daa77db/1:1/w_160/9e0d0d40.gif,2005-03-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3132-10th-avenue-freakout/,Lex,"As Fog, Andrew Broder's music sits at the crossroads of electro-pop, turntablism, found-sound collage, and indie-folk, and seems locked in a tug-of-war between clarity and deconstruction. Adding to this sonic tension is Broder's gentle and genial voice: It projects a tenderness absent from most collage-based music, which is typically either instrumental or features anesthetized vocals as a simplistic trope for modernity and alienation. Those contradictions played a major role in the success of Fog's sprawling but almost brutally minimal Ether Teeth. It's a shame then that 10th Avenue Freakout pulls away from this blankness, thereby muting the effects of its incandescent peaks. Here Broder is breaking with obscurantism and moving toward catchy Postal Service-like song structures, but although the spacious, detailed production is still topnotch, the record suffers because Broder doesn't fully embrace his pop impulses. ""Hummer""-- the title track to Fog's 2004 EP-- recurs and is a template for this album. Over plodding drums and a clipped choral sample, Broder intones a melodically tedious verse that gives way to pristine, perfectly phrased falsetto harmonies. The off-kilter drums, patchy organs, and faltering vocal melody of ""Can You Believe It?"" evoke an electro-pop Neutral Milk Hotel-- especially the chirpy brass near its finale-- and the svelte, suburbanly sexy whirr of ""We're Winning"" dips into some cheeky cultural criticism: ""Jesus Christ is my American Idol/ He's the brand new funky president."" And ""The Rabbit"" returns to Ether Teeth's sharply drawn contrasts, surging and collapsing with counterintuitive élan. If the whole album were this charming, it'd be an unqualified success, but too many songs proceed from point A to B with little variation or depth. Those tracks seem to equivocate between the collagist Fog and the pop Fog, reconciling their tensions instead of exploiting them. And so despite being peppered with luminosity, 10th Avenue Freakout is too often dragged down by aural wallpaper-- stretches of anonymity with few distinctive moments.","Andrew Broder's follow-up to Ether Teeth trades some of his obscurantism for electro-pop song structures.

For his first outing as Langtry, McKinney straps on his acoustic guitar and takes off on a 45-minute journey through the backwoods and waterways of America, nodding to such familiar signposts as John Fahey, Leo Kottke, and Robbie Basho. McKinney experiments with various tunings, and seems particularly fond of dropped tunings that give him a guttural low-end he can hammer on in his most percussive passages. ""The Ballad of Painless Parker"" makes striking use of this technique with a flurry of big-voiced, crashing chords. These compositions don't like to sit still, and McKinney maintains an impressive balancing act of kinetic motion and searching melody, often feeding one with the other. The nine-minute ""Chasleen, You Better Run to Catch That Train"" is a good example of this, creating melodic sparks from an inferno of rapidly shifting chords before settling down to develop the themes sketched out in the initial torrent. The album's slower moments-- like those in the middle of ""Chasleen""-- tend to be its least exciting, and though McKinney's technical proficiency is breathtaking, he often sounds too sparse or melodically meager. Still, such misgivings are forgivable in light of an exhilarating rag like ""Hobojangle"", a song that feels like the ghosts of dozens of itinerant bluesmen bursting back into our world. It's the best of McKinney's compositions and one that keeps the Takoma spirit alive as well as any I've heard. It's not easy to make one acoustic instrument engaging for a whole record, but Langtry has managed to do it, taking his place alongside contemporary guitar explorers such as Stephen Basho-Junghans, Shawn Persinger, and M. Ward.","Folk debut from Iron & Wine guitarist Patrick McKinney.

Matt Valentine and Erika Elder's Ragas & Blues has been sitting under my stylus since last October, a brother to dust and a victim of its own 220-gram, difficult-to-digitize physicality. That, and I've spent the past six months on a bus between Philly and New York-- a commute that, for whatever reason, I found better soundtracked by Astor Place mixtapes than dense, freeform Appalachian folk. When I'd return home around 10, I'd try to give Ragas a close listen, sorta dig it but inevitably collapse. I never thought the record was boring (at least any more than other guitar improvisations zing), just a little daunting and very time-consuming. Funny then that the only luck I've had feeling out the record came as I packed for good. Ragas & Blues still gets schrifted-- I listen saddled with last-minute tasks, deciding which books I'll bring with me, washing sheets for the pull-out couch I'll sleep on until I can afford a mattress, tearing myself apart over whether I should buy a Mac Mini for the time being or sack up until a G5 laptop comes out. A million things are happening, and throughout it I'm thankful for the extent to which Ragas & Blues has been my narcotic. Really, I'm just happy to know records like this can still affect me when I make time for them. Only a year ago, I couldn't get enough of this stuff, warm drones and inscrutable anti-pop washing over me as I prepared for general exams and master's dissertations. Now I walk an hour in the cold for twenty-cent dumplings just to save money for rent, enjoying one-liners and beats to make me bang bang bang before high fidelity and thoughtful conversation. One lifestyle's not necessarily better than the other but, for instance, a thoughtful conversation could've saved me the embarrassment of my mother telling me last night that in the word ""folk"", the ""L"" is silent. Yep, like salmon. Last year several people understood neo-foke aka freakfoke as the Great Otherworldly Escape from 2004's terrible reality. What a farce. I like Devendra and Joanna and Espers and the Animal Collective and all the Tower Recordings records I finally got to hearing, but they're all fleeting, convenient distractions next to TR members Matt Valentine and Erika Elder's patient and full-fledged invasion. This record's vinyl-only for a reason: The duo's Eastern strings and sruti box drones and flutes and occasionally proper blues guitar make sense only with undivided time and wide-open ears-- which is to say, Ragas & Blues may be the worst iPod album ever. Instead, this is a different, more proactive kind of background music, the kind that, if you want it to, will vacate and occupy you-- make you disappear.

Lullabies to Paralyze,Queens of the Stone Age,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bc5e6ef95969320266/1:1/w_160/48b4a89b.jpg,2005-03-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6607-lullabies-to-paralyze/,Interscope,"Since their semi-official kickoff in 1998, Queens of the Stone Age have plowed through a bevy of peripheral players, some famous (Dave Grohl gripped sticks for 2002's Songs for the Deaf, and Screaming Trees vocalist/solo act Mark Lanegan stood in as touring frontman last year), and some lesser-known. (Members of Fu Manchu, Monster Magnet, Soundgarden, and A Perfect Circle have all slipped in and out of the collective.) Still, the looseness of the band's lineup has never significantly altered its sound: The Queens' reigning aesthetic-- droning, riff-heavy rock peppered with vaguely cosmic flourishes-- has been fiercely maintained by core members Josh Homme (vocals, guitar) and Nick Oliveri (bass, snarls). Scrutinizing and compartmentalizing the internal chemistry of rock bands may be a thankless (if not stupid) pursuit, but when Oliveri was publicly ejected from the band in early 2004 (ousted by Homme, who disapproved of certain ""bad behavior""), the future of the Queens' swampy rock seemed awfully precarious. But any lingering doubts about who was actually commanding the band's direction should soon dissipate: Lullabies to Paralyze is, at least stylistically, not terribly different from the three Queens records preceding it. Now rallying the contributions of bassist Alain Johannes, drummer Joey Castillo (ex-Danzig), and multi-instrumentalist Troy Van Leeuwen (formerly of Failure, currently in A Perfect Circle)-- while snatching guest turns from ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, Garbage's Shirley Manson, and the Distillers' Brody Dalle (who sing together for a barely-audible 10 seconds)-- Homme is hardly playing alone. Still, even with all that sweaty support, Lullabies to Paralyze can feel vaguely alienating, often twisting itself into an unsociable and determinably distant collection of hazy, leaden rock. Maybe because of Oliveri's absence, Homme seems slightly more guarded, and his breathy falsetto and tinny guitar tones are now more cagey than jubilant, mixed low and perpetually retreating. Homme has always had a habit of slathering most everything with a few too many multi-tracked drone effects, all ghostly echoes and over-dramatized coos, and, unsurprisingly, Lullabies is most successful at its most brash. Homme clearly digs a good giggle (see the handclap-riddled, ""I hate rock'n'roll!"" musing of ""'You've Got a Killer Scene There, Man...'""), but he's even more of a sucker for proggy chops and dry ice-fueled metal theatrics. Unsurprisingly, Grimm's Fairy Tales are often cited as a significant influence on Homme's songwriting, and the dark, no-shit didacticism of those cautionary fables is recreated flawlessly-- the plodding (and awkwardly misogynistic) ""Everybody Knows That You Are Insane"" indicts relentlessly, (ill)advising without coddling, thrashing itself into oblivion. The excellent ""I Never Came"" opens with twitchy drums and muffled bass thumps, unfurling slowly and majestically and exploding into a thick, heady swirl of high, airy vocals and guitar theatrics, while the equally impressive ""The Blood Is Love"" swallows a spinning, carnival-esque melody, layering pert metal chords over a meandering and ethereal guitar line (reminiscent of 2000's R). Single ""Little Sister"" is all cowbell and sneering vocals, flirting with but never quite indulging pop perkiness, a honking guitar riff shooting through like a punchline, while ""Tangled Up in Plaid"" is impossibly addictive (flitting from spare, echoing verses to a raucous, wind-milling chorus-- not entirely unlike former single ""No One Knows""). Lullabies occasionally evokes early Black Sabbath and nods to a few psych-rock stalwarts but, like most Queens' records, it's oddly unclassifiable. It's also troublingly inconsistent, sagging and losing steam (opener ""This Lullaby"" and the plodding, seven-minute guitar jerk of ""Someone's in the Wolf"" are unimpressively limp)-- all sprints and breath-catching, highs and lows. Ultimately, Lullabies to Paralyze stands as a frantic, steamrolling realization-- dynamic, twitchy, and anchored by Homme's uncompromising vision.","On their first record since the departure of Nick Oliveri, Josh Homme's Queens of the Stone Age sound... like they always have: droning, riff-heavy rock peppered with vaguely cosmic flourishes.

A Few Steps More,Monade,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39513d197565213bd75/1:1/w_160/27ace700.jpg,2005-03-17 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5389-a-few-steps-more/,Too Pure,"When Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier released the 2003 LP Socialisme ou Barbarie-- her first as Monade-- the primary difference between it and the sound of her parent band was that the Monade stuff was more raw. Socialisme-- tellingly subtitled The Bedroom Recordings-- wasn't lo-fi but it was stripped down, with a couple instruments doing the work on each track and a minimal amount of layering. Considering how lush Stereolab records can be, Socialisme really did seem like a different animal. On A Few Steps More, the line between Monade and Stereolab is blurrier. With the addition of permanent members, Monade are now a proper band recording in a professional studio, and the result sounds a hell of a lot like Stereolab. Sadier has one of the most distinctive voices in indie rock, so in one sense the similarity isn't surprising. Catch her in a duet with your granny on bongos and you'll still hear plenty of our beloved Groop. But here so many of the trademark influences and timbres (AM radio horns, Brazilian rhythms, lots of Moog) are presented in essentially the same proportions we've come to expect from late-period Stereolab, and it's a little strange that two different bands can be pointed in almost the exact same direction. It also makes me wonder what Tim Gane-- the person I once imagined to be Stereolab's genius auteur (there's subconscious sexism for you)-- is contributing at this point. Still, once you get past the initial disorientation, A Few Steps More is a solid record. Sadier's vibrato-less purr (she's singing mostly in French here) is as enticing as ever on ""Das Kind"", and halfway through she dusts off the high-pitched, far-off wail that shows which layer of Beach Boys harmony caught her attention. ""Wash and Dance"" has a nice build, transforming from a floaty ballad into a swirl of ringing guitar and driving drums. A few songs are too long, and it gets a bit samey by the end, but the album projects a coherent and well-realized mood: Mid-tempo, mellow, and dreamy, these songs make me glad spring is just around the corner. ""2 Portes, 7 Fenetres"", which is basically two songs in one, is enjoyable but illustrates the problem with this record. Starting out as a dirge that gives Sadier a chance to demonstrate her trombone playing, ""2 Portes"" slides into a crisp bossa nova beat with a fat Moog line and harmony vocals by Marie Merlet. Hearing Merlet's husky, unfamiliar voice against Sadier reminds me how cool it would be for her to challenge herself and immerse her talent in something unfamiliar. The head of steam built by years of good Stereolab records is considerable, but A Few Steps More still feels like the work of someone who's coasting.","On her latest Monade release, Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier drafts in a full band and drifts toward the sound of her more well-known group.

Dream Sounds,Nagisa Ni Te,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c394eb335119a49ed746/1:1/w_160/3a38a375.jpg,2005-03-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5700-dream-sounds/,Jagjaguwar,"I tend to keep my emotions at arm's length when it comes to non-English-speaking artists. Because if it ain't in English or ""intermediate level"" Spanish, I have little hope of identifying a slow-tempo song as, say, a love ballad or a dirge. Nagisa Ni Te's sixth album, Dream Sounds, puts these lingual uncertainties to rest. Yes, the lyrics are in Japanese, but from the adorable pink bunny surfing on the album cover to the idyllic English song titles, this boy/girl psych-folk duo sparkle with undeniable innocence. But don't confuse Nagisa Ni Te members Shinji Shibayama and Masako Takeda with the childish, giggling Japanese stereotypes depicted in Lost in Translation and Pokémon; these guys know their rock'n'roll history down to the grit. After all, their name (translated) is borrowed from the esteemed 1974 Neil Young album On the Beach, and on Dream Sounds the duo delve deep into classic North American rock, emerging with shimmering bits of Young, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan. The nostalgia is doubly powerful considering the album's four lengthy tracks are re-workings of previous Nagisa Ni Te songs, though here both classic rock and classic Nagisa Ni Te get a 21st century facelift. More a retrospective than a ""best of"" album, Dream Sounds starts and ends with longer, more pensive Shibayama-dominated numbers, with Takeda's punchier pop gems sandwiched in between. In opener ""True World"", Shibayama (formerly of Idiot O'Clock and Hallelujahs) slowly and wistfully delivers the song's folksy melody as though paging through a photo album before passing the vocals off to an equally starry-eyed Takeda midway through. Takeda's tracks are closer to straightforward rock; power pop nugget ""Anxiety"" holds up to most anything from Last Splash, while ""Me, on the Beach"" channels Neil Young's candid harmonica and acoustic interplay. Those songs form a sweet, gooey middle inside the album's thick, oftentimes strenuous outer layer. Twenty minute-plus closer ""True Sun"" doesn't get points docked because of its length and repetition; instead it's hampered by guitar chords and melodies that run past their sell-by dates. Because of these flaws-- and the song's reflective mood-- it turns the second half of an otherwise captivating album into something self-serving and distant. Luckily, the scintillating treasure within Dream Sounds shines through the dense outer shell, and-- as far as I know-- it's safe to put your guard down and indulge in its cherubic bliss.","This Japanese duo delve into classic North American rock, emerging with shimmering bits of Neil Young, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan.

Field Rexx,Blitzen Trapper,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4809d034d5c69bf30a9/1:1/w_160/f50e0db3.jpg,2005-03-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1153-field-rexx/,CD Baby,"Blitzen Trapper have earned a handful of fans in their native Portland, Ore., for their playful, ADD-like songs, but their sophomore effort shouldn't be dismissed as fluff-- Field Rexx is an earnest crack at bluegrass, country, and folk that's young and brazen enough to incorporate elements from multiple genres. The album opens with a brief honky-tonkin' interlude and ""Lux and Royal Shopper"", which adds some crunch to a cluttered, Rouge Wave-esque modern take on folk. ""Love I Exclaim!"" puts anemic good-time country over funky breakbeats, and is one of the album's most ingratiating moments, but the early peak is the gentle, spaced-out ballad ""Summer Twin"". That track leaps into the aptly self-described ""freak-pop"" on its chorus, which is all referee whistles and chicken-scratch guitars. Several different musical elements-- howling rock, acoustic plucking, electronic percussion, harpsichord-- pop in and out of its simple melodies, but the lo-fi production lends it a sonic cohesion. On the record's second half, the songs become more traditional and their arrangements more homogenous, but they're just as worthwhile. ""Concrete Heaven"" is equal parts Willie Nelson and the shambling folk experiments of Beck's One Foot in the Grave, its lyrics alternating between evocative and goofy (from ""Paper cups and cigarette butts left in the sink"" to ""I'm still walkin' around in rainbow-colored thongs""). They play the wide-eyed AM pop of ""Asleep for Days"" comfortably and convincingly, and the chorus of ""40 Stripes"" recalls CSN&Y. ""Dirty Pearls"" is a speedy, competent bluegrass number, but the last few songs lack the strong melodies and quirk of the bulk of the album. Quirkiness isn't the main selling point of Field Rexx, however-- it simply has a healthy sense of variation. There's a lot of disparate, whimsical sonic elements in the disc's earlier songs, and they're tastefully incorporated, but most of the memorable twists and turns are provided the old-fashioned way, like the subtle guitar lead in ""Summer Twin"". On Field Rexx, Blitzen Trapper may not take the same chances as other genre-bending artists, but nor do they strive to. It simply (and successfully) aims a back-porch country/folk album for left-of-the-dial tastes.

What I Did After My Band Broke Up,Steve Wynn,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa82b1335d7bf1699699/1:1/w_160/ba612834.jpg,2005-03-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8757-what-i-did-after-my-band-broke-up/,DBK Works,"Although Steve Wynn's former band Dream Syndicate was one of the most influential and terminally underrated groups to emerge from the nascent American independent rock movement of the early 1980s, the title to this collection of Wynn solo material from the past 15 years seems like something of a wry joke. By this point, the length and productivity of Wynn's solo career completely dwarfs that of Dream Syndicate, and over the past few years he's logged more gigs with his current combo the Miracle 3 than he's managed with any other lineup. And, as this well-rendered, 17-track compilation illustrates, the argument could be made that Wynn's more recent solo work bests his earlier group's output in both ambition and consistency. Throughout his career, Wynn has done little to disguise his ardor for the Bob Dylan/Lou Reed/Neil Young pantheon. A gifted tunesmith and raconteur, like his heroes Wynn has always made the most of his rather unremarkable vocal range, and his best songs are frequently detail-packed narratives which chart as close to prose as to poetry. By his own admission in this set's liner notes, Wynn was left somewhat adrift in the immediate aftermath of Dream Syndicate's breakup, and the middling nature of glossy albums like Kerosene Man and Dazzling Display reflected this uncertainty. But in 1996, his career took a revitalizing turn with the release of Melting in the Dark, a collaboration with Boston's Come, whose Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw provided Wynn a much-welcomed injection of raw punk energy. This was a beginning of a fruitful alliance with Brokaw that extended through Wynn's landmark 2001 double album Here Come the Miracles. So it should come as no surprise that this collection is wisely weighted in favor of Wynn's more recent material, as it steers the listener immediately into the buzz saw of ""Amphetamine"", from 2003's Static Transmission. This opening track is a near-perfect collision of primal VU thump and serrated, Ragged Glory guitar, and should be ranked alongside the Modern Lovers' ""Roadrunner"" as an ideal soundtrack for a long distance driving. From there the album moves unceremoniously from strength to strength without regard for chronology (or continuity, for that matter). Other highlights include two raucous tracks with Come-- ""Shelley's Blues, Pt 2"" and ""Why""-- the pounding, atmospheric ""Death Valley Rain"", and the somber, Lennon-like balladry of ""What Comes After"". As with most collections there are sins of omission and inclusion (personally I would've chosen the Byrdsian jangle of Dazzling Display 's ""Tuesday"" over ""Conspiracy of the Night"", which features a typically overbearing cameo by the infernal Johnette Napolitano) but What I Did After My Band Broke Up should not only serve as a valuable introduction for latecomers but also as evidence that Wynn's near future may very well prove as valuable as his recent past. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Visitation Rights, a bonus disc included with What I Did... that consists of old Wynn songs reinterpreted for piano and vocal. Featuring keyboard assistance from Green on Red's Chris Cacavas, this set finds Wynn playing against type, stripping tunes like ""Crawling Misanthropic Blues"" and ""My Family"" down to spare, cocktail lounge arrangements. And though this method proves songs such as ""Drought"" and ""Mandy Breakdown"" to be virtually indestructible, this format does not (to say the least) display Wynn's reedy vocals in the most flattering light. Variations like the bouncy strut of ""For All I Care"" do nothing to improve upon the originals, and in fact could likely make you cherish the previous versions all the more. Though Wynn's career has been pockmarked with enjoyable detours and one-offs (such as 1998's acoustic Take Your Flunky and Dangle) perhaps Visitation Rights is one cul-de-sac best left unexplored.","Former Dream Syndicate leader collects the best of his now 15-plus years of solo work.

(Better renew my JAPM membership card.) Admittedly, 75% of modern d'n'b is pretty much shit: syncopated gabba that you'd have a hard time holding me to my sneaking affection for under oath. But drumfunk, choppage, edits-- whatever you want to call it-- is about a bazillion times more interesting than the great minimal techno swindle. (No matter what that sniffly grouch Michael Mayer might say.) And if people who were trading Elephant 6 singles at the turn of the millennium are now listening to six minutes of swish-swish-swish with the occasional acid noise, then surely there is room in their hearts for six minutes of a Shiva-armed Art Blakey going nuts on DMT. The Emerald Isle's Bassbin label has made a crusade out of reviving the spirit of Blue Note (the club where the early Metalheadz sessions took place, not the jazz imprint). The godfather of the scene is the mighty Paradox, who looks like a tiny lawnmower got taken to his hair. Dev is one of the few old skool junglists-- check 1991's still preposterous ""Mixrace Outta Hand""-- to rail against the scene's entropic drift towards mid-range distortion. (The drums and the bass were lost in a poker game to UK garage but were later found behind a council estate after being stripped for parts by grimey gremlins.) Here, on ""Bongolia"", he goes in hard on the ""Apache"" break, throwing some pounding Dillinja-style subs underneath to sate the raving massive. Bassbin's beats aren't as choppy as market leader Inperspective's or as twistedly two-steppy as Offshore's. Instead, their raison d'etre is in their name: This is soundsystem music for boomin' in ya jeep. Skitty's ""Sweet Vibrations"" rides the titular punchy bassline to nowhere in particular. Equinox finds the 9,000th variation on the ""Amen""-and-dub combo on ""Don't Want to Hurt You"". Usually d&b; tracks with ""soulful"" vocalists are deadly (Robert Owens, so much to answer for), but Robert Manos keeps it restrained against Seba and Lenk's swimming low-end and gorgeous synths on ""Everyman for Himself."" Burial tune of the comp is Calibre's ""Can't Stop This Fire"", which-- with bouncy drums and a jolly vocal hook-- is not a million miles from the mainstream scene. It's a reminder that, once upon a time, rolling d&b; was dance music, tugging at your hips, vibrating up your spine, making you feel warm and enveloped rather than just an excuse for veiny teenagers in puffy vests to take a lot of speed. (My only real request is to slow it down to a more reasonable 160bpm. Too much soft-core d&b; still sounds like hummingbirds playing soul jazz.) Still, I am about as happy as could be expected with the health of underground d'n'b in 2005. Fuck microhouse, you can have it back.

Hotel,Moby,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36a69fc7814a47cd63f/1:1/w_160/c20ddb75.jpg,2005-03-17 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5349-hotel/,V2,"Just who the hell is Moby? I mean, I know who he is-- he's the most ubiquitous little bald man this side of Verne Troyer. I meant, who is he, really? Because years of pop culture brainwashing have created a caricature of Moby as a posterboy for electronic music, Buddhist-vegan mysticism, and stiff-back political correctness-- none of which is evident on Hotel. For starters, Moby used to make electronic music, am I right? I distinctly remember the first time I came across his literary moniker; it was affixed to a single of his rave-house burner ""Go"", which still lingers in my hippocampus. Nowadays, other than the couple of vanilla slices of new age, er, I mean, ""ambient"" that bookend Hotel (as well as, yikes, an entire bonus disc), Moby's songs are less techno than the song in which Eminem gave his famous anti-techno bitch-slap. Sure, some drum loops and keyboard diddles are still in the background, but nothing that couldn't turn up on an aging midlife crisis album by, say, John Mellencamp. Mellencamp isn't a bad point of reference, come to think of it. Hotel strikes the same mood of one-way-street sloganeering, although it's aimed at a sort of coastal blue-state weekend mysticism rather than a Midwest red, farm, etc. And strangely, the author of Buddhism for Dummies anthem ""We Are All Made of Stars"" now apparently thinks we are all on about a first-grade level of comprehension. Songs tip off impending choruses like a bad poker player leaning back in his chair when he's got a big hand. Imagery is simple, familiar, and recycled-- rain is used twice, first on ""Raining Again"" and reprised on ""Love Should"". And Moby spends a lot of time repeating trite phrases, such as ""look at us, we're beautiful."" (Twenty-two times in, duh, ""Beautiful""-- counting is less painful than listening.) Most disturbing is a two-song block roughly halfway through Hotel where Moby abruptly decides to stop Up With Peopling and, gulp, gets his sex on with the help of chanteuse-on-payroll, Laura Dawn. Over a beat that sounds like what sci-fi movies pass off as futuristic pop (think the Diva scene in The Fifth Element), ""Very"" drops pillow talk like eight-year-olds imagining how babies are made: ""Now we are naked/ Just you-oo-hoo/ You and meeeee."" And slow jam wannabe ""I Like It"" comes complete with soft-core moaning, wet keyboards, and spoken-word talk-singing of the title (43 times, to be exact)-- all it needs is Bob Odenkirk occasionally adding ""Yeahhhhh."" Dawn is also a collaborator on the album's most egregious sin, the track that drops Hotel from being mediocre dreck, easily quarantined and ignored, to something far worse. I'm talking, of course, about Melville's cover of New Order's ""Temptation"", which takes the lovestruck dancefloor daze of the original and strips it down to nauseating Rhodes, preset, and canned strings slowcore. Suddenly, I find myself longing for the halcyon days of Frente!. If Moby has accomplished anything with Hotel, it's that he may have become the rare musical artist equally despised by both of modern music criticism's warring camps. Rockists will retch at the blatant AAA radio-whoring of ""Raining Again"" and ""Spiders"", while popists will abhor Moby's indie-esque self-satisfaction-- though thankfully there's nothing here as condescending as Play's ""South Side"". But being the man in the middle isn't working for Moby; overdosing on moderatism, the guy who supposedly gave electronica a face is ironically now a blank manufacturer of rock-by-numbers. Whether seduced by chart flirtations or weary of constant mockery, Moby has filed away his distinguishing characteristics, and all that's left is an artist too played out to even be one of Eminem's punchlines.","More one-way-street sloganeering and Up With Peopling from the guy who used to be America's Great Electronic Hope.

Sick of them yet? In the early 90s, the measures of people in their 20s against their teenage 80s plasticity resulted in everything sounding like Grand Funk. In the early 00s, everyone realized the 90s were a drag and wondered if there was something to that Thompson Twins thing after all. I anxiously await whatever Jill Sobule/G-Funk hybrids the early 2010's will bring us! The 12"" single was the art form of the 80s. They were the last gasp of the single as a physical, commercial artifact. Disco made the 12"", and it brought disco's dub-space and length to everything it touched. Yes, even the Thompson Twins. Sure, it's survived via dance music, but today what comes between those elongated intros and outros is a lot less likely to be a song. (Oh, but what about the cassingle? Well, it destroyed the B-side. The CD single gives us up to six bullshit ""remixes"". So you were saying?) Now just look at that cover up there: those stark white letters, that deep salmon background, that gorgeous boombox. It's enough to give the design fetishist in me an erection of the heart. And the idea of a compilation of 80s 12""'s already wins points as they were some of the first records I ever bought. And this comp makes a pretty good case for all the various aspects of the 12"" philosophy. The Cure's ""A Forest"" just goes for sheer treetop scaling length. Scritti Politti's ultra-brite (p)op-art stabs and gimmicky samples are a mini-essay in mid-80s remixing-- as well as on what the 80s did to punk. Grace Jones' ""Pull Up To The Bumper"" all but invents M.I.A. (yeah, I said it) except scarier and better. The Icicle Works' ""Love Is a Wonderful Color"" is one of those ""wow where was this hiding?"" tracks that make you think there's something left to 80s crate-digging. On some level, I should just be able to write ""Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go?"" and go out for a beer. 12""/80's is one of those collections that-- due to concept, packaging, and a goodly portion of its contents-- I want to grace with a much higher rating.

Likewise, you can skip tracks here, but Mick Hucknall, the unibrow of pop, returns every time you replay it. There is some real wack, horrid shit (Lloyd Cole? The Style Council??) next to the unmitigated triumphs (Yazoo, they can never tarnish you). Plus, it's too white (only one rap song and no Prince), too British (understandable since it's a UK import, but a U.S. version is urgent and key), and too in thrall to the whole ""80s = stuff you hear in a dentist's office"" idea. Also, despite containing two Trevor Horn productions-- ABC's Fairlight panto-cabaret ""Tears Are Not Enough"" and Propaganda's Bergman-funk ""Dr. Mabuse"", there's no Frankie Goes To Hollywood! You wouldn't make a box set called 7""/60's and leave off ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine""!","This 3xCD set collects three dozen 12"" singles from artists such as the Cure, Human League, Echo and the Bunnymen, Scritti Politti, and ABC.

Congotronics,Konono N°1,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc47ea9e61561daa743d/1:1/w_160/84f362b5.gif,2005-03-16 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4596-congotronics/,Crammed Discs,"It is entirely possible that an amplified, slightly distorted likembe creates the most awesome sound on earth. There's no other sound quite like it, and there's no other band like Konono No. 1, the assemblage of Bazombo musicians, dancers, and singers from Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) that makes the likembe the center of their sound. It's something of an accidental update on Bazombo trance music, and it's thrillingly unique stuff, a torrent of kinetic sound that straddles the line between the traditional and the avant-garde. The likembe is commonly known in the West as a thumb piano, and there are variations of the instrument in different cultures across Africa-- perhaps the most well-known is the mbira, which is used across Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. The instrument has a pinging tone that is practically designed by nature to sound awesome with a bit of amp fuzz on it. Konono employ three electric likembes-- each in a different register-- and the amplification is very makeshift. The band formed in the 1980s to perform its traditional music, but soon found that being heard above the street noise of Kinshasa wasn't a going concern as long as they remained strictly acoustic. Scavenging magnets from car parts, they built their own microphones and pickups, and they augmented their percussion section with hi-hat and assorted scrap metal. Vocal amplification came from a megaphone, and the accidental distortion they drew from the likembes cemented their distinctive sound. Though their music is still traditional in style and content, recent trips to Europe have turned them on to how avant-garde what they're doing is, and they've fallen in with musicians like the Ex, Tortoise, and the Dead C. Congotronics is actually the second Konono record to receive international distribution-- last year's Lubuaku was a live recording from a European tour-- and it's bound to win them a following amongst noiseniks, experimental music buffs, and open-minded worldbeat fans, though most other people will likely find it merely interesting. The record opens with ""Kule Kule"" and a reprise of the same, and these tracks stake out the sound of what follows quite precisely. ""Kule Kule"" is hauntingly subdued, with the three likembe players locking in with each other on a series of choppy riffs and bursts of crazy melody (anyone familiar with the Ex's ""Theme From Konono"" from last year's Turn will recognize the themes and riffs), while the reprise adds vocals sans megaphone. The four remaining songs all sound as though they were recorded live, and there is in fact some applause between a few of them. The themes laid out on the introductory songs surface repeatedly over the course of the album, lending it a suite-like feel. ""Lufuala Ndonga"" comes crashing to an end, and its conclusion becomes the introduction of ""Masikulu"", on which the frantic chants are swept up in swirling currents of percussion. The most stunning song is the instrumental ""Paradiso"", which puts the likembe interplay front and center, their distorted, scattershot melodies ricocheting from side-to-side over a thumping backbeat, skittering hi-hat, and some amazing snare work. It's funky in a sort of incidental manner-- obviously meant for dancing-- but hitting on a sort of deep funk rhythmic sensibility without really even trying. Konono No. 1 are the kind of band that remind us that music still possesses vast wells of untapped potential, and that there's virtually no limit to what can be developed and explored. There's little precedent for a record like Congotronics, even as the music at its core goes back many generations and predates the discovery of electricity by some time. It's important to note that these are not pop songs in any sense of the word-- this is traditional trance music with an electric twist, and should be approached as such. That said, it's among the most fascinating music I've heard and deserves a listen by anyone with even the remotest interest in the possibilities of sound.","This unique African band pals around with the Ex and Tortoise and creates something of an accidental update on Bazombo trance music.

The Thunderbirds Are Now! frontman plays up his vocal femininity and vamps all over Justamustache, belting out exhortative non-sequiturs like Tim Harrington impersonating Exene Cervenka. Prototypically feminine vocalization allows for a broader range than the less subtle masculine style, and you'll find Allen cooing, yelping, sighing, wailing, and ranting, but reining it in just enough to avoid the overweening brattiness of, say, Beep Beep. Justamustache is Thunderbirds Are Now!'s second full length, but it smacks so strongly of a new start that we might as well consider it their first. The Detroit quartet have mostly abandoned the labyrinthine meters and abrasive textures of their spaz-punk roots, retaining only their penchant for variety. Now their songs tend toward lambent melodies, cyclically striated guitars, and galloping disco-punk rhythms, and are usually comprised of several potential choruses. The raucous ""198090 (Aquatic Cupids)"" demonstrates this focused miscellany, quickly shuffling through succinct hooks. ""Harpoons of Love"" follows and is more direct, jumping out as the album's other instant attention-getter; its reeled-off lyrics and quick changes call to mind a new wave version of Blood Brothers. Spitting drum machines, neon-tinted synths, corkscrewing guitar lines, and shout-a-long refrains sustain the record's teetering glide across 10 sleek yet pockmarked tracks. Allen cites Les Savy Fav as a major influence, and Justamustache evokes a poppier, starker take on that band's Go Forth. This is particularly apparent in the guitar playing, which shades Gang of Four's Andy Gill's expressive, staccato slashing into LSF's Seth Jabour's melodically complex stutters and coasts, sharply contrasting sinewy rhythms with fanning sprays of squealing notes. ""Better Safe Than Safari"" sends the album rocketing out of the gate with this hectic formula, its relentlessly thumping low end and bright synths holding it together like skin. ""Eat This City"" juxtaposes rapidly ascending electronic tones and runaway clatter with a late solo that's pure, wafting Jabour Zen. ""To: Skulls"" and ""From: Skulls"" sound like guitars rehearsing long-since dropped conversations to themselves, synthesizers attempting to speak like humans. With their signing to the influential Frenchkiss label, their stylistic quantum leap, and their dancepunk steez, Thunderbirds Are Now! are in a good position to earn some attention. If they gain entry into the new new wave winner's circle, we'll all be doing a lot of reading about Gang of Four this year...again. It makes for drag reviews (only so many ways to say ""great energy-- classic post-punk with a modern twist!""), but it's a hell of a good time. I'll take it.","Motor City revivalists work with lambent melodies, cyclically striated guitars, and galloping disco-punk rhythms.

Snowball + Singles / Skywriting + Singles / For Keeps + Singles,The Field Mice,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beafabf31b7dc71561a9/1:1/w_160/63ef59bf.jpg,2005-03-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11748-snowball-and-singles-skywriting-and-singles-for-keeps-and-singles/,SarahSarah,"One of the dumber myths about rock is that it's always meant to have balls, and one of the first things we're meant to notice about the London-suburban Field Mice is how blatantly they disregarded that notion. We live in our world, right: Pop stars are sexy extroverts and hip-shaking tomcats and there's something suspect about a guitar group getting too sappy, too cloying. For this band, though, pop stars are just starry-eyed suburban virgins or maybe librarians, and ""sappy"" isn't even a real word. If that sounds like a wimpy schoolboy wish, well, so do a lot of Robert Wratten's lyrics. Check out the milky-wet martyrdom of ""Sensitive"", or song titles like ""I Can See Myself Alone Forever"". Wratten's big-eyed earnestness can go beyond the point of embarrassment and into some realm of almost psychedelic earnestness, and in spots it's difficult to tell whether it's studied naiveté or whether he's genuinely arrested in some weepy boyish crush phase. Attitude like that is the better part of why the Field Mice make some people blissy-happy and some people pukey-sick; this stuff can sound gorgeous or creepy, brave or pathetic, dreamy or reactionary. Listening through these LTM reissues of the band's catalog, though-- three albums, 1989 to 1991, with all those out-of-print Sarah Records singles and EPs folded in-- you get a keen demonstration of what a huge red herring the schoolboy stuff actually is. The truth is that critics-- hell, even fans-- haven't come far in developing a vocabulary to talk about this kind of music: It's still referred to as all barrettes and cardigans and ""pure, perfect pop."" But if the Field Mice were just adorable indiepop amateurs, then why do they sound so slick and stylish? Yeah, they have their sunny strum-a-longs and wistful laid-back jangle-- songs so ""pop"" that it feels like someone must always have sounded like this. But then not so long afterward, didn't Ride come along in the same stripey shirts and fuzz the exact same stuff up into ""higher"" art? And weren't the Field Mice just as ambitious? They tried their hands at just about every leading edge-trend of the era: Fuzzy pop, homespun ""indie-dance,"" wimpfueled acid house, and sweet-cream dream-pop shoegazing-- all moves that struck late-80s ears as full-on trippy. Couple that with the non-stop starry eyes, and there's something kind of intense about reckoning with this music: No matter how sweet or guileless they sound, they're as ""difficult"" of a band to deal with as your average avant-gardists. The payoff is this: When the songs work, it's all easy. The first of these reissues, Snowball, wraps up the band's sweet-and-simple early work-- open chords and a muted drum machine, stripping down bookish English indie to a purity that can leave the Sundays looking like a prog-metal outfit. The best of these tracks have a charm that makes boyish idealism sound like one of the better phases of life, and they cast a long shadow on everything that came after them. These singles are the wellspring of nice-kid indiepop and crooning-about-English-rain tricks and nearly everything the Lucksmiths or the Ocean Blue ever did; they sound nostalgic now, but then they sounded nostalgic from the moment they were recorded. ""Emma's House"" is legendarily great, dead simple, and endlessly forlorn; it's like the Go-Betweens gone weepy, with one of Wratten's best lyrics folded in. ""Let's Kiss and Make Up"" is dance music played by a band that's on the verge of falling asleep; it's easy to forget how much better it sounded in Saint Etienne's hands. ""You're Kidding, Aren't You"" is all style, and ""Everything About You"" is one of the most joyful, least opaque love songs I've ever heard: Just ""I love the sound of your voice/ I love the way that you smile."" If the Field Mice were ever really a band for the wallflowers and the librarians and the shy little suckers in their beds with their books, then this was it-- and like most things that seem a little regressive in the UK, it's a sleepy Anglophile's wet dream. But if Wratten was that kind of reactionary-- retreating, Morrissey-style, from the real world of ""cool"" into some lonely-schoolboy phase-- then how to explain the next album, Skywriting? The thing kicks off with a nine-minute ""We are Interested in Acid House"" epic that sounds like some failed prototype of the stuff Seefeel and Slowdive did. The next few tracks are more reassuring. ""Canada"" is a bouncy strummer that has Wratten pining away for some girl who's pining away for some other guy: ""The ones we love don't always love us back/ You and I, the two of us, know that."" ""Clearer"" even sounds like the Smiths, or at least McCarthy. But by the time you get to ""Humblebee"", they're doing-- get this-- a washed-out sample collage that half-sounds like Disco Inferno on an off day; its mantra, ""Chocolate, love, sex,"" even made it as far as a t-shirt. Fold in a collection of surprisingly slick pop singles, and the whole shambly-wallflower caricature is demolished; some of this stuff sounds just this side of scoring a fluke pop hit, something like Modern English's ""I Melt with You"" or the Lightning Seeds' ""Pure"". The last record, For Keeps, is the most accomplished of the bunch: The pop is more ambitious and sprightly, and the cutting-edge failures seem a lot less failed. It's here that the band starts to sound like Slowdive gone ultra-sappy-- which, depending on your tolerance for chimy guitars and Swiss Miss keyboards, can be a mildly remarkable thing. In and around that, you get plenty of acoustic sweetheartism, and some of the band's most winsome pop songs: I spent part of my teenage years convinced ""Coach Station Reunion"" had to be a Monkees cover, despite its psychedelic sighs. When the pop jangle and the spacey tricks come together right-- on ""Of the Perfect Kind,"" or New Order wannabe ""Missing the Moon""-- you realize the Field Mice were a lot better at making music than they get credit for; these tracks are as impressive as they are cloying, and dated in a pretty fascinating way. What's hard to say is how much of this material is all worthwhile. Even if you develop the kind of massive soft spot that fuels the band's obsessive cult following, you'll still wind up picking through these tracks looking for the moments that really and truly work. Even stranger is the realization that the Field Mice weren't particularly better at anything than the bulk of their peers. Blueboy were more musical, the Railway Children were more stylish, Heavenly were smarter, and the Primitives were more exciting; the Darling Buds were better for dancing, Blind Mr Jones were better at low-budget shoegazing, the Hit Parade were more reliably adorable, and Honeybunch-- though far from English-- were better than just about everything ever. There's a reason, though, that the Field Mice loom so large above so many of their contemporaries, and it's just that they were the damned Field Mice: Whether you're swooning or laughing or rolling your eyes at this stuff, the reason is that it's packed with so much personality, so many idiosyncrasies and extremities, that you can't help but get involved. For the English, this stuff is wrapped up in a whole indie-kid social-class context the rest of us don't have much chance of ever grasping-- but on this side of the Atlantic, it's the singularity of the thing that counts. So whatever their reputation, this is a band that asked-- and deserved-- to be taken on the same ambitious terms as the groups they admired. Do that, and they rapidly emerge as one of the most unique outfits of their time. Maddeningly unique, maybe-- but cracking into that world can offer some awfully singular rewards.","Sarah Records favorites and indie pop prototypes the Field Mice have their entire catalog reissued over three titles and four discs.

D.O.D.,Do or Die,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba813d197565213b13c/1:1/w_160/f0a12216.jpg,2005-03-15 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2601-dod/,The Legion,"Hip-hop eats its own. Artists who were once on top of the world are half-forgotten footnotes a few years later. But hip-hop is also fiercely regional, and its backwaters are undyingly loyal to their hometown heroes. Chicago, the third-largest city in the nation, has only produced a few rap artists of note, and therefore remains a hip-hop backwater. So when Do or Die-- the first hip-hop group to bring a platinum record home to the Chi-- decide to mount a comeback, local royalty like R. Kelly and Kanye West line up to furnish them with beats and hooks. Former Do or Die protégé-turned-superstar Twista helps out, as well. Do or Die need any help they can get. The trio-- comprised of AK, Nard, and Belo-- moved a million copies of its 1996 debut Picture This, but its three successive LPs have yielded diminishing returns. Worse, the group has little in the way of star quality or personality. Do or Die may have pioneered the Midwest quick-tongue style that brought Twista to prominence-- and it's fun to hear rappers that genuinely enjoy practicing their craft-- but the group doesn't have a lot to say. AK and Belo rap quickly, and Nard raps slowly, but otherwise they're difficult to tell apart. When your album's only quotable lines come from a guest spot (Remy Ma on ""U Already Know"": ""I keep it pimpin', treat niggas like hoes/ Oh, I got dick in different area codes""), you've got a problem. The group's lack of personality has a blank-canvas effect: The album is only as good as its beats. D.O.D. starts out strong with a few epic bangers but quickly dissolves into limp stepper's tracks. On N.O. Joe's bombastic operatic opener ""Right Here"", the group's members slow their flow down to a Scarface preacher boom, and it works. On Kanye West's phoned-in, lite-funk, cheesed-out slow jam ""Higher"", the group sound completely lost, and it doesn't work. And so the album's one great track, ""Magic Chick"", is almost entirely the work of its producer and guest vocalist, one Robert Kelly. Kells turns in a deliciously slippery Eastern-inflected track with chilly winding acoustic guitars and a gorgeously tossed-off hook. Kelly also raps, dropping one of the sleazy, slippery bounce flows that he introduced on Unfinished Business. AK and Belo sound like they're having the time of their lives rapping over this monster, but they're not the stars of the track. They never are.","Chicago hip-hop vets get help from Kells and Kanye on this comeback LP.

Fabric20,John Digweed,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9875e6ef959693229a6/1:1/w_160/2d55f3f4.gif,2005-03-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2313-fabric20/,Fabric,"This one is problematic. Fabric-- with its slickster graphics, awkward metal tins, and terminal hesitation between hauteur and crowd-pleasing-- is as responsible as anything for the continuing gentrification of dance music as hipster lifestyle accessory. Friends rave (no pun intended, swear to God) about the London club for which the series is named, and a few of these mixes you can't beat with a wiffleball bat. But there's something off-putting about what basically amounts to ultra-cheesy Ministry of Sound Annual comps (big up DJ Sammy and Darude) with a kind of i-D/Nylon/Wallpaper sheen superimposed. Fabric20 is probably the most blatant case yet of this series wanting it both ways. Let's get one of the biggest, blandest DJs in the world and give him a crate of microhouse we boosted from the Voigt brothers' yard sale. Godlike genius producer Ewan Pearson probably didn't know Fabric was planning this when he ribbed on his blog that a new Perlon track could be played ""safe in the knowledge that in nine months time Erick Morillo et al won't. Hurrah!"" But there's a strain of ""underground house"" that's getting closer and closer to ""big room"" prog/trance on its own, much of it spearheaded by Kompakt. (Bite your tongue.) So it's not surprising Michael Mayer's remix of Superpitcher's ""Happiness"" mopes in after the disc's climax. What is surprising is that Digweed didn't go with even trancier Kompakt gear like Magnet's ""Rising Sun"" or Mayer's ""Privat"". We join our program already in progress with the gorgeously stereo-sensitive atmospherics of Pete Moss' ""Strive To Live (16b Mix)"". (Next time I'm over at Ashton and Demi's in the isolation tank, I'll request this.) Then the beats arrive before we've put our makeup on and we're gliding through Adam Johnson's unobtrusive ""Traber"" (zzz) before Richard Davis gets his Martin Gore on to Repair's ""Forgive & Forget"". Then Diggy sends me all funny by dropping the breakbeat and tuff little sax riff of DJ RaSoul's ""True Science"". The rest of the mix isn't particularly micro-- or even that hip-- just ""solid"" (in the same sense that a Ford Taurus is) house music that doesn't earn a differentiated genre tag. (Solid House would be wholly redundant without the existence of the adobe.) I couldn't remember a single thing about it when it came time to write this review, but, then again, I usually nod off after ""Fascination Street"" and that doesn't make Disintegration any less of a stone classic. Err...","One of the biggest, blandest DJs in the world goes...microhouse? WTF?

Golden Ocean,50FootWave,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be8fea9e61561daa78fc/1:1/w_160/68afbc4a.gif,2005-03-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3296-golden-ocean/,4ADBMG,"Lyrics you expect from a Kristin Hersh record: ""Last-gasp nymphomania/ Somehow de-sexualized/ I'm gonna wash that man right out of my head/ And soap him into my eyes."" Lyrics you might not expect from a Kristin Hersh record: ""You know what?/ Shut the fuck up!"" It's not even the words themselves that are surprising there-- even at her most misleading, there's a directness to Hersh's lyrics, a plainspoken candor that grounds even the most disparate imagery she can conjure. The surprise lies in how she leans hard on that ""fuck"" line. Usually, such profane offerings sneak out the side of her mouth. Here, Hersh throws her whole body behind those four words, belting them out while the music gathers mass and speed like a cartoon snowball. In all fairness, Golden Ocean isn't much different from recent Throwing Muses records (or the EP that preceded the disc, which shares three tracks with this album). Where 50 Foot Wave distance themselves from Hersh's other work is in the volume department. Say what you want about the quality of the record, but there's no denying that it is ridiculously loud-- squealing and slamming all over the place. If there's a brief eddy in a song, it's going to give way to a tidal wave. If the song already seems like its heading toward a noisy conclusion, don't be surprised if they double-time it. The catalyst for this slight change is most likely the drummer, Rob Ahlers. Unlike Hersh's usual drummer (longtime Muse David Narcizo), Ahlers eschews subtlety and polyrhythms for full-out, balls-to-the-wall banging. He barrels through this entire album, and it's up to the other two Wavers to keep up. For Hersh, this means bellowing at the top of her lungs for most of the record, subsuming any prettiness in her voice for the scratchy old-woman's yell hiding behind quick-cutting couplets like, ""Your voice has a sing-song quality/ And bones were made to be broken."" It's fantastic stuff-- at its best, the innate catchiness of Hersh's writing gets a shot in the arm from her cavalier vocals and musical caterwauling. One of Hersh's former labelmates posited that motherhood equaled mental freeze. No doubt said labelmate never envisioned Kristin Hersh, mother of four, entering her 21st year as a professional musician, leading a group that runs laps around most rock bands.","Latest from Kristin Hersh matches the directness of her lyrics with a new-found love of sheer volume.

Employment,Kaiser Chiefs,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc46abf31b7dc7155c99/1:1/w_160/d7985903.jpg,2005-03-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4595-employment/,Interscope,"I've never understood why British bands obscure their accents when they sing, but they've been doing it for ages-- at least since ""She Loves You"". Recently, however, there seems to be a mini-wave of UK acts brandishing their accents with a frequency last heard in the early days of post-punk. To these American ears, those vocals are part of what makes the Futureheads and Bloc Party sound as good as they do. Kaiser Chiefs are another of these groups, although their first album, Employment, isn't in the same league as the debuts from either of their above-mentioned countrymen. One reason for this is that the band keeps the energy level constant over the course of the entire disc. There's plenty of variety in the material-- with different rhythmic feels and tempos-- but every song is approached with the same kind of in-your-face ebullience as the others, an approach that grows tiring. Still, it's deadly entertaining in bursts-- especially if you pick out the right bursts. There are a handful of potential singles that make Employment worth the trip. Chief among them is ""Na Na Na Na Naa"", a song that rockets along on Manfred Mann pianos, setting the workmanlike harmonies of the verses against the titular falsetto hook. Kaiser Chiefs seem most comfortable at a sort of medium boil with big, energetic harmonies, Moog squiggles, and mild guitar/keyboard interplay. They can unleash an anthem when they choose, like ""Modern Day""-- the only song on the LP that is truly dynamic. Its fluid verses are the most spacious, unforced passages on the record, and there's a palpable sense of build prior to the towering chorus. Admittedly, the song also makes me picture band members asking for more cowbell in the monitor during recording, but that's also part of its charm. Opener ""Every Day I Love You Less and Less"" sets the tone with its tale of a guy who's so over his ex-girlfriend that he feels obliged to tell her how great his life is without her (in other words, he's pining). The band's spirited attack sells the track hook, line, and sinker. It's a shame that enthusiasm becomes exhausting by the record's end.","These Leeds natives are reminiscent of the Futureheads and Bloc Party; unlike those bands' debuts, however, this LP is entertaining in bursts but exhausting as a whole.

In a Cave,French Toast,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17fb1335d7bf169828a/1:1/w_160/07b06f9a.jpg,2005-03-15 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3335-in-a-cave/,Dischord,"Anyone who's spent time with the 20 Years of Dischord box set knows that variety is not a priority at 3819 Beecher Street. Since Dischord moved away from caffeinated teenage hardcore in the mid-80s, the label has become a one-stop shop for crashing angular guitars, churning post-funk rhythm sections, inscrutable and sometimes political lyrics, and furiously clenched vocals. Some of the label's bands have been stunningly great (Fugazi, Lungfish), and some have been pretty meh (Faraquet, El Guapo), but few have been above resorting to guitar clang. Dischord's D.C.-only policy is only part of the story; the District has produced a ton of independent music (the Dismemberment Plan, Dead Meadow, go-go), which the label has opted not to fuck with. Instead, it centers itself around a loose circle of friends who constantly seem to be forming and breaking up bands. If you've been in one Dischord band, chances are pretty good you've been in two or three or seven. Jerry Busher and James Canty, the two multi-instrumentalists who make up French Toast, have been kicking around this scene for years. Busher is The Other Guy From Fugazi, the second drummer at that band's live shows, and Canty was a member of Nation of Ulysses and the Make Up. French Toast are sort of Dischord's Spoon, stripping the label's sound down to its essentials. The guitars are flat and muted, the vocals spare and disaffected, and the theatrical, climactic scream-along choruses are absent. The band's economy and sparseness may have something to do with the fact that it only has two members, but there's no sense of looseness or abandon to its tracks; every element of every song is carefully put into place. There's a certain cold disaffection to songs like ""Back Off or Els"", with its tightly-wound guitars and monotone Busher vocal, and ""Pattern"", with its restrained motorik chug-- Canty's yelping background vocals buried deep in the mix. A few tracks toy with drum-machine beats and electronic flourishes, and one, ""New Dub"", is a headlong leap into its titular genre. Many of the tracks have an almost uncomfortable tightness; it's easy to miss the messy passion of Canty's previous bands. But the two have a way of locking into a tense, neurotic groove and hanging on to it until their knuckles turn white. Only on the last track, the stunningly gorgeous ""Nobody Knows"", do Busher and Canty fully realize the possibilities of their newfound minimalism. The track entirely abandons Dischord post-hardcore, relying on a few piano plunks and a soft, plaintive vocal until a slow, sad piano-and-drum-machine groove kicks in halfway through, recalling the blissful, melancholic rapture of Spacemen 3's Playing With Fire. It's an unexpectedly huge leap forward for a band that might need to leave its origins behind in order to find its voice.","This Dischord duo is made up of multi-instrumentalists Jerry Busher (Fugazi's touring band) and James Canty (Nation of Ulysses, the Make Up).

No doubt, this album was a blast to record-- a party-and-a-half in a small room with only awesome dudes. If Hello Stranger isn't terra nova, Berlin's old man technogloom DJ Kaos has definitely loosened up a bit since the other things he used to do. Here he's collaborated with old and new buds alike, coming up with this programmatically fun italo punk-funk chi-house post-9/11 distillation of every remotely trendy genre coolly revisited in the last five years. Divatox, this is your worst nightmare. Copies of copies of copies, whatever-- some of these songs are actually likable. Kaos and dudes know each sound's sweet spot, picking, cutting, and pasting only the most time-tested licks for nine flawless test-tube babies.

That track on Hello Stranger sounds erasey. Yup. For the record: Captain Snax got his duefork a few weeks ago here. Random and overly reductive: I find the similarities among the Out Hud, LCD, and Kaos albums-- same number of tracks (cutting Out Hud's 28-second intro), ""last songs,"" openly referential and genre-based, none of them as dancey as people expected them to be-- somewhat amusing. Insightful and more important than anything I've said so far: Midway through 80s D-train groove ""Juices"" is a pretty terrible impression of Louis Armstrong, but to its credit, it's also the first Kirstie-Alley-impersonating-Louis-Armstrong impression in recorded history.","Erlend Øye is featured on this distillation of every remotely trendy genre revisited in the past five years.

After all, in post-emo America, it takes a certain sort of music geek to get into the irony-free cuddlecore of, say, the Softies, whose live ""It's Love"" caps this two-disc set. Let's face it, though: Either you're with the Lucksmiths, or you're with the terrorists. That aesthetic in mind, A House Full of Friends compiles the highlights of 34 house parties you probably didn't attend unless you were living in Portland, Ore., between 1997 and 2004. The story goes: Faced with dwindling all-ages options and a prohibitively costly bar scene, Magic Marker co-founders Mark Rothkopf and Curt Kentner invited their favorite bands to play in their home. Those bands, in turn, lend their recordings to this retrospective of twee times at 4306 SE 34th Ave. A House Full of Friends is best received as an introduction to recent indie pop from the Pacific Northwest and beyond. The Shins, the compilation's biggest name, are represented here with a slinky, worthwhile cover of T. Rex's ""Baby Boomerang"" from last year's Fighting in a Sack EP, while the Lucksmiths turn in a characteristically chipper tune about a drowning relationship, the previously unreleased ""Once Again"". The Decemberists' still-vivid Victorian vision on 2003's ""The Chimbley Sweep"" may be familiar to most listeners, but Ashley Park's pleasantly Band on the Run-tinged ""Chelsea Beautiful"" probably isn't. Magic Marker's own Dear Nora, All Girl Summer Fun Band, Lunchbox, and Tullycraft also make strong appearances, but labelmates the Owls, whose ""Air"" should have been among last year's most-blogged mp3s, are regrettably absent. And tucked away as the second disc's penultimate song, the Salteens offer a brassy pop nugget, ""Time You Have Been Wasting"". The rest of the tracks are the stuff of a Twee.net listserv wish list: famous-if-you've-heard-of-'em bands like Aislers Set, #Poundsign#, Dressy Bessy, and Mates of State. The collection isn't without its clunkers, such Andrew Kaffer's glitchy title track.

"Lonely People of the World, Unite!",Devin Davis,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba65e6ef95969322c6f/1:1/w_160/53f69b17.jpg,2005-03-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2600-lonely-people-of-the-world-unite/,Mousse,"This power-popping ode to loneliness is the one-man-band opus most basement-dwelling indie rock nerds think they could make if they felt like it. Mop-topped and horn-rimmed, Chicago by-way-of Florida singer Devin Davis is ambitious, but it's not necessarily his nasty trombone or theremin chops that make his debut solo album better than your local mom-and-pop clerk's self-described ""Bolan meets Pollard"" pop masterpiece. Instead, it's his knowing way around a walloping chorus and his welcome sense of restraint and economy that allow said hooks to live for many hum-worthy listens. A loosely conceptual record, Lonely People of the World, Unite! sees Davis embodying a varied cast of, well, lonely people-- or, as it happens, lonely ghosts or lonely turtles. ""Iron Woman"" doubles as the record's seafaring jumping-off point and its most distinguishable, immediate moment. ""It's hard to live in a basement and not get carried away,"" sings Davis on the Guided By Springsteen stomper. This lone wolf mostly takes his own advice to heart. Recording the vast majority of the album by himself, Davis doesn't often succumb to vain overindulgence and his piled-on retro-instrumentation punches up more than it bogs down. The singer's limited yelp hinders some songs from reaching Kinks-esque fantasia, but on ""Turtle and the Flightless Bird"", Davis' vulnerability matches his hard-shelled counterpart's grounded hopefulness. The track finds the title pair in an unlikely partnership, and it reads like a heartbreaking fable. Davis' less quirky, more obviously derivative endeavors fall flat. ""Moon Over Shark City"" isn't as much homage to Bowie's ""Suffragette City"" as an inexcusable copy-- all the way down to the pounding piano and ""woo-hoo"" back-ups. And the power ballad ""Sandie"" slips under its own well-worn bombast. The exclamation point at the end of this album's title is a testament to Davis' sense of mutual togetherness. Just as he looked to organs, drums, and gongs to quell his own isolation in a new city, many of the characters in his tales of woe are buoyed by the songwriter's optimism. Loneliness has rarely sounded so celebratory or inviting.","Chicago power popper and his one-man ode to loneliness.

Nolita,Keren Ann,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc44abf31b7dc7155c96/1:1/w_160/322f8787.jpg,2005-03-14 06:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4594-nolita/,Blue Note,"Not Going Anywhere, Keren Ann's radiant 2003 release, was a fluke. The album was recorded on a whim and wasn't intended for widespread release. As indulgences go, it was an astonishing feat: gently balanced, melodically fecund, restrained yet confident. That Keren Ann would want to keep the album private almost makes sense: Her lyrics are peppered with the oblique aphorisms of someone who's concerned exclusively with herself. Compared to its subdued predecessor, Nolita almost feels tense. But Keren Ann keeps a cool head. Patience is her biggest asset, and Nolita's 10 songs sound relaxed even when you'd expect them to break a sweat. Opener ""Que N'ai-Je"" (the first of four French-language tracks; there were none on Not Going Anywhere) is a dreamy wash. One by one, the instruments overtake each other until Keren Ann is half-drowned in a mash of upright bass, acoustic guitar, trilling strings, brush-stroked drums, and a laconic organ. The surplus is a break with the stark minimalism of Not Going Anywhere, but the change is welcome: This noirish, world-weary Keren Ann is no less captivating than her more precious former self. Keren Ann has a frail, diaphanous voice that's predisposed to the soft, solvent French language. Singing in English at the impossibly low volumes she favors, syllables are often lost as her voice shows fine cracks, like a weathered painting. On ""Chelsea Burns"", the LP's first English-language track, the lingual contrast is revelatory. Luckily, this is one of Nolita's strongest songs, a wistful, electric ballad marked by the appearance of a fiddle and a harmonica-- outsiders to Keren Ann's standard instrumentation. The album's title track is also its centerpiece. Seven minutes long and wontedly unhurried, the song opens with a facilitating acoustic guitar lullaby played at a tempo verging on lugubrious. Keren Ann enters with a purposefully punny vocal: ""It's late, I think I'm gonna stay, think I'm gonna bury you,"" she sings, but the ""bury"" is drawn out and slurred-- she could just as well be singing ""marry you."" A hollow, reverberating trill stretches out in the darkened space like moonlight rippling over water. She eventually stops singing altogether and just breathes, at first lightly, then deeply and insistently as the background strings build to whooshing climax. The moment is at once gloriously baroque and understated. Everything thereafter is a comedown, but is still satisfying. ""Roses and Hips"" and ""One Day Without"" recall the mindless drift of Keren Ann's erstwhile work, only perhaps a bit more grounded in realism. The latter layers a brisk, distorted-beyond-recognition guitar beneath Keren Ann's wispy vocal as she struggles to keep her footing; that the singer would test herself against her own songwriting shows maturity and humility beyond her 30 years.","Second album of wispy indie pop from the multilingual singer.

Spiritual Unity / Live on the Riviera,Albert Ayler,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a167ea9e61561daa47bc/1:1/w_160/f0646afc.jpg,2005-03-14 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11649-spiritual-unity-live-on-the-riviera/,ESP-Disk,"Saxophonist Albert Ayler recorded Spiritual Unity for a new label called ESP-Disk in 1964. For years, ESP-Disk has been semi-dormant, licensing its back catalog to other labels for manufacture, but they've now reasserted control and have started a reissue campaign. Spiritual Unity and Live on the Riviera, which are interesting pieces in Ayler's astonishing run, are part of the first wave. My favorite Ayler material involves him working with another horn. Something about his fat, driving tone-- the way it conveys joy even as his overblowing threatens to crack his instrument-- sounds a little lonely with just bass and drums. Still, some of his best music was recorded in the trio format, and he had a telepathic empathy on Spiritual Unity with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray. Together Peacock and Murray form a sound backing that at times seems more like an endlessly shifting cluster of sound than an actual rhythm section. Murray has a light, rapid touch, keeping the cymbals and snares going pretty much constantly, never breaking the flow of the music with a heavy roll, and Peacock functions as an extension of his textures. Out front is Ayler, sounding strong and huge, opening and closing with versions of ""Ghosts"". His approach to this signature piece sets the tone for what he tried to accomplish with his music. Though he obviously has a deep love of simple folk melodies, the intensity of his feeling is such that a tune could never contain it, and the sound spills over and around the structure until it eventually bursts forth in a chaotic torrent. ""The Wizard"" doesn't begin quite as catchy and features an even harsher tone, moving into more challenging areas of free jazz, and ""Spirits"" is a swooning lament that has Ayler stretching notes to melodramatic and deeply moving lengths. Spiritual Unity is short (just under 30 minutes), intense, and a deserved classic. Fast forward to the final year of Ayler's life, 1970, as he toured Europe with a quartet. Constantly searching for new textures, during the past couple years he'd experimented with vocals, bagpipes, harpsichord, and rock bands. On Life on the Riviera, the main remnant from these restless years is the presence of Ayler's girlfriend, the poet and musician Mary Maria. While her spoken words on ""Music Is the Healing Force of the Universe"" are on the one hand painfully dated hippie drivel (""music causes all bad vibrations to faaaade away"") there's something oddly fascinating about the clash between her sentiments and Ayler's insane screeches. He's screaming through his tenor, pinching it to sound like a kazoo as the force of his wind drives it up a few octaves, and yet Maria's words (""it makes one want to love instead of hate, it puts the mind in a healthy state of thought"") imply that what they're doing is a universal expression of affection and warmth. Maria's voice is scattered throughout, sometimes reciting verse, sometimes singing, sometimes mimicking Ayler's phrasing with blubbery scat. Her crooning on the straighter ballad ""Heart Love"" is pretty solid, and when Ayler pipes in to sing a verse, as he often did in his later years, he makes her sound like Dionne Warwick. But as awkward as the vocals can get, the material is strong enough to survive it. The bouncy ""The Birth of Mirth"" shows that Ayler was writing great themes all the way to end. A rousing version of ""Ghosts"" is the closer. Seven minutes into it, the band stops playing-- it's the apparent end of the set-- and the crowd applauds appreciatively. After 15 seconds or so of cheers the band kicks in with a reprise of the theme, the crowd explodes, and then, for three more minutes, the variations continue. It's incredible to think of how many places Ayler could still take the tune. Sadly, within four months the ending would be final and his opportunities would cease.

Human After All,Daft Punk,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87fc0084474cd0c0e3c/1:1/w_160/524ba9cb.jpg,2005-03-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2137-human-after-all/,Virgin,"Ideally, the physics of record reviewing are as elegant as actual physics, with each piece speaking to the essence of its subject as deliberately and as appropriately as a real-world force reacting to an action. In that world, where this is just another record by another dance act, Human After All is passable and hardly special. But in my head, where items like Homework and Discovery and-- oh, what the hell-- ""Music Sounds Better With You"" and ""So Much Love to Give"" are allowed to be admitted as evidence, and where the weight of expectation and precedence get to have a say, this feels like not just a failure, but a heartbreaker. The rap on Human After All is that it was recorded in two weeks, which should've been our first clue that it was going to surface as a droopy flower. Such cavalier recording approaches fly in the rock world because listeners are forgiving of minimal production methods; hell, as any Julian and Fab'll tell you, under the right light, they'll even embrace them. In rock music, where descriptors like ""raw"" and ""ragged"" are virtues, finesse is not only unnecessary, it's often discouraged. In dance music, where the illusion of performance has to be sculpted, finesse is more critical-- make a record in two weeks and 99.6% of the time, it'll sound like it was made in two weeks. Turns out Daft Punk are (mostly) human after all, because from a compositional standpoint, this sounds like it was made in about 19 days. Even the good stuff sounds painfully extemporaneous, like early sketches of tracks that deserve to be much better. Take the title cut-- a slick, vocoder-driven track that, despite being one of the better offerings on the record, has such a clinical build that it registers as patterned and completely starved of joy. It's Daft Punk going through the motions and, for the first time in their career, sounding like cynics. If there's a defining thread to Human After All, it's that there's very little here that rings with wonderment or joy. The songs that make the most overt stabs at those emotions still sound like vague approximations of better songs that preceded them: ""Robot Rock"" is a poor man's ""Aerodynamic"", ""Technologic"" a poor man's ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", and so on. Ultimately, it's the phoned-in ""Television Rules the Nation"" that confirms Daft Punk's slackening standards; they give us nine proper songs after four years and this is one of them? In the end, it's not as if there aren't things to like about Human After All-- both ""Make Love"" and ""Emotion"", for example, are totally charming. I just wish that they didn't come at the expense of Daft Punk's mystique. Then again, if the point is to be rock, maybe on some totally boring level, they've succeeded admirably: What's more rock'n'roll than hitting the self-destruct button?","Sadly living up to the album's title, Daft Punk follow the exquisite, joyous Discovery with a record on which they seem to be going through the motions and, for the first time in their career, sounding like cynics.

Anomalies,Cephalic Carnage,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5729d034d5c69bf32d3/1:1/w_160/732b23f3.jpg,2005-03-13 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1381-anomalies/,Relapse,"Like most stoners, I woke up one day as a dirt-poor college student, chock full of grandiose ambitions, little motivation, and a whole semester's worth of film classes. See, the smart kids who liked pot but didn't have the balls to sell it had already spent so much time syncing The Wizard of Oz with Dark Side of the Moon, that answering the high-creativity/low-math requisites of a film studies program was the next logical step. But like so many others, I found myself lulled into a coma by the French New Wave, indifferent to samurai films, and learning absolutely nothing about filmmaking. The one bit of quasi-useful information I retained, however, came from a class entitled something totally pompous like ""Debunking the American Comedy 1960-1990: From Droll to Dull"". After watching Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, our professor made the fairly obvious observation that the film is a brilliant satire because although the audience may be in hysterics, at no point do the characters ever laugh at themselves. In spite of the barrage of ludicrous imagery and verbiage used to satirize an impending nuclear holocaust, no one in the film seems to find anything funny. Crappy metal bands have thrived on this very same technique for more than two decades. For anyone who's familiar with grindcore, and in particular gore-grind, the genres have blended technical wherewithal and tongue-in-cheek sex, violence, and drugs seamlessly. One of the reasons songs about flatulence and midget porn can actually be enjoyable is because the musicians are almost always competent, and almost never take themselves too seriously. Then we have Cephalic Carnage, a Denver-based quintet who've made a pesky habit out of melding numerous styles of experimental music with death metal and grindcore. Though the band truly established itself as a key player in the burgeoning avant-garde metal community with its 2002 release Lucid Interval, Cephalic Carnage have spent the better part of 13 years smoking weed, touring extensively, and-- most importantly-- knocking metalheads like me on our asses. I loved every second of their previous LP, Lucid Interval. From the mock black metal to the hilarious mariachi track, it's a damn-near perfect blend of mind-bending metal and deadpan comedy. And in the three years since its release, we've witnessed the band soar to the top of Relapse's impressive talent roster. But while CC have lost none of their mammoth bite and originative wiles, the unruly dose of irony on the overcooked Anomalies left me a bit overwhelmed, and more than a little disappointed. ""Scientific Remote Viewing"" is a perfect opener. Featuring vocals from Cattle Decapitation's Travis Ryan and lyrics that could be interpreted either as a conspiracy theorist's musings on MKULTRA or a DMT travelogue, the track is flawless. ""Wraith"" follows a similar mold of crunching grind. On it, drummer John Merryman lays down his best drumming to date: searing blast beats and jazzy syncopation, all executed with taste and precision. Guitarists Zac Joe and Steve Goldberg's blistering arpeggios shine on ""Counting the Days"", a song that resembles labelmates Pig Destroyer musically, but lyrically is a cloying thank you note to fans. And ""Kill for Weed"" is a great little grindcore stoner anthem. Its Golem vocals are a nice touch, but it works because it doesn't aspire to be anything more than a metal band expressing its lust for marijuana. Regrettably, there are few moments like that on Anomalies. More often than not, the band spends so much time amusing itself with creative technical masturbation that the audience is left wondering when to laugh. The first real misstep of the album is ""Piecemaker"", which starts with a fantastic Electric Wizard stoner riff and then turns into Suicidal Tendencies wankery. Although it's probably intended as homage to Terrorizer's grind-meets-hardcore aggression, the track is a bunch of genre clichés run amok. ""Enviovore"" bears a striking resemblance to Cattle Decapitation's Humanure, revisiting all of 80s thrash's favorite themes: overpopulation, plague, genocide, and pollution. ""Dying Will Be the Death of Me"" is a hilarious of parody of metalcore mallrats like the Blood Brothers, featuring actual-sung vocals, and represents the band's most radio-friendly offering to date. On ""Inside Is Out"", the band falls into the trap of passing off recycled Mr. Bungle noodling as experimentation, and here we encounter the major shortcoming of Anomalies: Instead of exploding the structure of a single genre and creating a unique sound, Cephalic Carnage knock the cobwebs off of a bunch of tired traditions (hardcore, fusion, doom) and do their best to incorporate as many of them as possible into 45 minutes. One of the most trying aspects of this disc is that it juxtaposes so many disparate styles-- and to CC's credit, that's no small feat-- and as a result it often feels more like a tribute record than 12 tracks of original material.","Experimental grindcore behemoths run short of idea on this follow-up to 2002's Lucid Interval.

Congratulations,Chariots,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72f13d197565213935b/1:1/w_160/7359bdb2.jpeg,2005-03-13 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1798-congratulations/,Troubleman Unlimited,"There's just the faintest hint of nostalgia coloring the edges of Chariots' debut album Congratulations, which feels like something of a mid-90s throwback, combining the complex ferocity of such bygone groups as Drive Like Jehu and Jawbox with the streamlined pummel of the Jesus Lizard. And though Chariots don't actually succeed in turning any new noise-rock sod, they deliver these 10 tracks with such passionate, frenetic panache that they're able to deftly sidestep the numerous landmines that could've potentially fatally wounded the project. Recorded by Dave Gardner (who has also worked with Rocket From the Crypt, Detachment Kit, and Hot Snakes), Congratulations is loaded with massive, airtight riffs yet fully outfitted with invigorating whiplash contours-- as when the driving, headlong locomotion of ""Hips Unite"" dovetails abruptly into a hand-clapping, pint-raising hooligan stomp worthy of AC/DC. The heavily effected vocals of Travis Bos, whose work in Song of Zarathustra was often abrasive enough to qualify as a deal-breaker, remain forceful but manage to be relatively nuanced and (on occasion) surprisingly tuneful. It's long been my opinion, however, that the success or failure of such an enterprise is almost wholly determined by the quality of the rhythm section, and in that respect Chariots emerge smelling like clover. Bassist Arthur Gandy plays with the same spare, limber economy with which David Sims once anchored the Jesus Lizard, while Matt Kepler's pounding, casually intricate drumming serves as a virtual focal point on hyperactive tracks like ""GRPSTX"" or ""Bored Housewife Syndrome"". The album's title track finds the group expertly matching dissonant scrawls of guitar to Gandy's lively Peter Hook bassline, while Bos screams indistinct unsweetened nothings and his party-crashing keyboards flirt shamelessly on the sidelines. Meanwhile ""Number One With a Bullet"" revisits some of the more metallic territory covered by Zarathustra, before the album finally collapses onto the broad shoulders of ""The Laundry Room in This Building Is Equipped With a Burglar Alarm""; the entire group wrapping their collective fists around the song's meaty core and squeezing it into oblivion.","New project from Song of Zarathustra frontman Travis Bos throws back to mid-90s noise rockers Drive Like Jehu and Jesus Lizard.

Back to Me,Kathleen Edwards,by: Stephen M.

The lead-off ""In State"" could be ""Six O'Clock News"" redux, since both describe the same romantic quandary: What do you do with a lover who's a recalcitrant criminal and whose lawlessness interferes with your relationship? On ""Six O'Clock News"", the narrator sits by as her lover is gunned down on television, her unborn child left fatherless. But on ""In State"", the narrator is an active agent in her fate: She turns him in with no illusions and very little compunction, singing, ""Maybe 20 years in state will change your mind."" The differences between these two lead-off tracks and their narrators reveal Edwards' growth as a songwriter since recording Failer. Back to Me is a bolder album, with Edwards figuring more prominently and actively in the more personal songs. Nowhere does she sound more brazen than on the title track, in which she promises no escape for an errant lover: ""I've got ways to make you come,"" she sings, drawing out the last word in a sly innuendo before finally clarifying, ""back to me."" Fittingly, her band on Back to Me sounds tighter and more dynamic than the one on Failer. This type of country music is not especially notable for its innovation, but there are flourishes of sound that elevate Back to Me above similar efforts by Tift Merritt and Kasey Chambers. In addition to Benmont Tench's churning organ and Eric Heywood's stately pedal steel, Colin Cripps' crisp production and feedback-heavy guitar work give songs like the title track and ""What Are You Waiting For?"" an edgy urgency that that matches the rough vulnerability of Edwards' voice. Cripps, like Dave Draves on Failer, understands that the album's distinctiveness lies entirely with Edwards, the daring of her songwriting and the rawness of her vocals. She sounds tough-minded but world-weary as she sings of small-town inertia, big-city intimidation, and the thousandth romantic crime she's perpetrated. These characters aren't necessarily Edwards herself, but she inhabits them so unreservedly that she sounds believably vulnerable and alternately confused and confident. Edwards recently moved from rural Canada to the big city of Toronto, which ostensibly inspired the sense of dislocation that informs much of Back to Me, especially the final three songs. On ""Somewhere Else"", she longs to be anywhere but her new hometown, and ""Copied Keys"" evokes the sense of never belonging in a new lover's life: ""This is our apartment filled with your things/ This is your life, I get copied keys."" The gentler ""Good Things"" completes the trilogy and rounds out the album with its open-ended resignation that ""good things come when you stop looking."" Along with her reckless vocals, Edwards' insistence that place can affect identity and emotion has earned her numerous comparisons to Lucinda Williams, and her empathetic depiction of dead-end characters shares a strong kinship with Freedy Johnston. These comparisons are not without merit, but both Edwards' physical and lyrical voices are resolutely her own: she absorbs these and other starting-point influences but is never beholden to them. In fact, on Back to Me, she has joined their estimable ranks.","Canadian country singer's sophomore album explores the connection between place and identity, inviting comparisons to Lucinda Williams.

"The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 1: 59-61",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a835c0084474cd0c0d98/1:1/w_160/00202bc8.gif,2005-03-13 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2064-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-1-59-61/,MotownHip-O Select,"The building at 2648 West Grand Boulevard was like any other Detroit bungalow when Berry Gordy, backed by an $800 loan from his family, bought it and turned it into the offices for Tamla, his first record label. One can only speculate what the neighbors thought when he put up the sign that said ""Hitsville, USA"", but Gordy's optimism was backed by a strong business sense and proved to be well-founded: the Tamla name never became a household word, but his second label Motown did, and the rest is history. Motown grew quickly into a Motor City assembly line for hit songs, the label that put black music into white living rooms, and an institution that's taken for granted today as a part of the American cultural landscape. Gordy wasn't exactly new to the music industry when he opened up shop; he had dabbled in management, owned a failed record store, and co-written several hits in the mid-50s for soul innovators Jackie Wilson and Etta James. It was an admittedly spotty record, but one that earned him respect amongst local musicians and performers. So Hitsville became a hangout for young musicians hoping to make it big, and the cast of characters that turned up in the label's first three years-- the period covered on Hip-O Select's new six-disc box The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 1: 1959-61-- is incredible: Smokey Robinson, Brian and Eddie Holland (two thirds of Holland/Dozier/Holland), James Jamerson, Benny Benjamin, the Temptations, the Supremes (née the Primes, or Primettes), Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong, Marvin Gaye. These are names writ large across even a cursory knowledge of r&b; and classic pop, and all of them helped build the label into a legend. As this set reveals, though, there were plenty of secondary players, one-offs, novelties, experiments, and trend-hopping tangents (not to mention a ton of gospel, Gordy shrewdly realizing that the audience for it was very stable) that helped shape the label as well-- and that's part of the reason these discs are so fascinating. Of course, you know the Miracles' ""Shop Around"" (just Motown's 20th single, but its first million-seller) and the Marvelettes' ""Please Mr. Postman"" (Motown's first #1 hit), but most of what's compiled here has been otherwise lost to history, leaving whole chapters out of one of popular music's most important stories. The Swinging Tigers, Eugene Remus, Gino Parks, the Equadors, the Valadiers, and Herman Griffin are anything but well-known, some having released just a one 45, but you can hear the Motown sound developing on their singles-- several of which are real gems. Every A-Side, B-Side, and replacement side from every single released on Gordy's Tamla, Motown, and Miracle labels from 1959-61 amounts to more than 150 tracks and almost seven hours of music, and to explore it both as it's presented here, in strict chronological order, and to jump around comparing, say ""Shop Around"" with Debbie Dean's answer song ""Don't Let Him Shop Around"", is supremely rewarding. Marv Johnson's ""Come to Me"", originally released on Tamla, opens things triumphantly-- not only is it a fantastic song, it was also a hit, albeit only after Gordy licensed it to United Artists, who were far better equipped to promote it nationally than he was. Barrett Strong's ""Money (That's What I Want)"" gave the label a national hit on just the eighth try, and it's typical of the impromptu genius of Motown's early years; the song was written by Gordy and Hitsville receptionist Janie Bradford off the cuff and recorded on the spot as two local white high schoolers stopped in on their way past Hitsville to sit in on bass and guitar. To this day, no one can even speculate as to who those two kids were, and who knows if they have any clue what they contributed to? Novelties abound on this set as well, including a half-dozen attempts to jump on the twist bandwagon that swept the nation on 1961. Of these, the most notable are ""Ich-I-Bon #1"", a surprisingly sharp surf instrumental by a band called Nick & the Jaguars, and the odd minor-key story-song of ""Small Sad Sam"" by Bob Kayli, actually Gordy's brother Robert performing under a pseudonym. The most mystifying of all the novelties, though, is Popcorn and the Mohawks' ""Custer's Last Man"" (incredibly, it's not even the only song about General Custer present here). ""Last Man"" is a totally bizarre, even mildly offensive radio play that stretches out to a ridiculous 4\xBD, and the single most glaring example of the fact that Motown hadn't yet established its famed Quality Control department. Other oddities are more successful, like Ron and Bill's ""It"", an attempt to create another ""Purple People Eater"" while that song was still hot, and Gino Parks' hilarious ""Blibberin' Blabbin' Blues"", an obvious attempt to beat the Coasters at their own ""Yakety Yak"" game. Parks actually proves on his second release, ""Same Thing"" b/w ""That's No Lie"", that he deserved far more than a novelty hit; the A-Side drips with soul, while the flip is like Sam Cooke and James Brown rolled into one-- gravelly, soulful crooning punctuated by startling, ear-piercing yelps of joy. No obscure act from the early days of Motown deserved fame more than the Satintones, though. A brilliant doo-wop act, they recorded five singles for the label and none took off, though all were great. Their aching, gorgeous ""Angel"" is one of the best songs here, and its B-side, ""My Kind of Love"", features beautiful harmonies and a crazy, very unusual string arrangement. String arrangements are something of a running theme throughout these six discs. Gordy became convinced early on that they were a signifier of class and a key to crossover success, hence several songs appear in two versions-- one with strings, and one without. Gordy would pull the original single and then reissue it with the same catalog number and the new arrangement, a tactic that did manage to produce some sales, but one that also understandably drives collectors nuts. Yet hearing alternate versions gathered in one place is fascinating. Other do-overs include the slower, inferior regional version of ""Shop Around"", a take on the song in which the Miracles sound almost tentative. Gordy apparently sensed that, and gathered the house band-- an early incarnation of the legendary Funk Brothers-- and the Miracles in the middle of the night to re-cut the song for the reissue, which of course would go platinum. As a musical journey, this set is nothing short of amazing, despite a handful of mediocre cuts and a few downright awful ones. By disc six, Motown is a well-oiled hit machine, and even a few of the twist knock-offs are pretty entertaining. It's huge fun to hear Marvin Gaye trying to position himself as a sensitive interpreter of showtunes (thank God that didn't last) or to check out the truly amazing house band-- has their ever been a pop bass/drums combo as outstanding as James Jamerson and Benny Benjamin?-- cutting loose on ""Snake Walk"" under the name Swinging Tigers.

In the Kingdom of Kitsch You Will Be a Monster,Shining,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a313d1975652139219/1:1/w_160/a6ce8b9f.jpg,2005-03-11 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7805-in-the-kingdom-of-kitsch-you-will-be-a-monster/,Rune Grammofon,"As a teen, I worked in the music section at Borders constructing complex, unsanctioned Siltbreeze displays and replacing listening-station copies of John Tesh's Sax on the Beach with Ornette Coleman's Free Jazz or John Coltrane's Stellar Regions. It was during one of these escapades that a manager approached me and pronounced Charles Mingus' The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady ""too raucous,"" adding that he liked his jazz ""spry,"" before hiking his Dockers and trudging off to the New York Times Bestseller List section. I bring this up because jazz purists (and in this dude's case, ""pure"" = ""freshly fallen snow"") make even the most obnoxiously close-minded indie nerds look as chilled-out as opium-drugged Taoists. So, those of you who never graduated beyond ""hard bop"" would be doing yourselves a favor by turning back now. For anyone else: In the Kingdom of Kitsch You Will Be a Monster is the third album (and first for Rune Grammofon) from Norway-based Shining, an experimental collective whose lineup includes two former members of Ninja Tune's electro-lite combo Jaga Jazzist: This album doesn't even remotely hint at that band's bland, ivory-tickling, snare-wrapping pedigree; Kingdom is labyrinthine, alternately creeping and brutally visceral, and certainly raucous. Maybe these sparkling, teetering, huge sounds reflect the coming-of-age of Shining's leader, multi-instrumentalist Jørgen Munkeby, who joined Jaga in 1996 when he was only 16. Tellingly, Munkeby grew up listening to Sepultura and Pantera before taking on the saxophone at the wee age of nine. Helping point Shining in other non-jazz (and non-metal) directions, bassist Aslak Hartberg is the mastermind behind Norway's best-selling hip-hop collective, Klovner i Kamp. So what do we have here: Jazzy art rock? Proggy jazz? Who knows. On top of any number of brassy instruments, there are clattering drum machines, moaning synths, chameleonic samplers, swooning (and frequently buried) vocal harmonies, and thunderous, window-rattling cathedral organs. Shining frontload the record with ""Goretex Weather Report"", an opener as mighty as anything I've heard this year. It begins with sparse, muted saxophone exhalations, clean handclaps, and tentative, chugging ministrations before, after a minute or so, thundersticks connect with earthly skins and guitars picks off stars. Taciturn in comparison, ""REDRUM"" offers dueling horns over squiggles of drums, rat-a-tat rave-ups, and a sighing vocal clip. ""Romani"" goes for flute/clarinet, distant bass, some drums, and vibes/xylophone, and the instrumentation descends while airy, harmonizing vocals ascend. The track doesn't explore much distance, but it covers a lot of surface area. Despite its ostentatious, Dune-referencing title, ""31 = 300 = 20 (It Is By Will Alone I Set My Mind in Motion)"" is a whisper, as if the band were playing from behind a wall of Tony Conrad gauze. But after a few minutes of drifting, sighing, and softly imploding, Shining mash together AM-radio vocal bugs, some extinct country's national anthem, and a feverish drum breakdown. Elsewhere, like wheedling new wave, ""The Smoking Dog"" kicks electro-drumpad Western tango and some (I kid you not) Bobby McFerrin-inspired scat, while the gonging and droning ""Magazine RWRK"" buzzes with atmospherics reminiscent of a plodding noise band jamming with a virtuoso French horn player. Check it out: There, somewhere over the horizon, that guy in the Mr. Bungle shirt took silent note of a playful 7/8 atmospheric break and wept in double-time. Over there, some kid tired of improvising to Rush and the ""Benny Hill Theme"" just got his groove back. But, hey techy, before you pick up a stopwatch and dork out, note that Shining keep things brief, subtle, tight, and aesthetically on-the-mark, suggesting progness (or at least, jazz kids spreading their rock wings) is often less about duration and bombast than complexity, invention, and the rigorous interplay of its players. ","Strikingly original Norwegian art-rock combo makes its debut for the prestigious experimental label Rune Grammofon, piling clattering drum machines, moaning synths and samplers, swooning vocal harmonies, and thunderous, window-rattling cathedral organs atop an alternately creeping and brutally visceral brass foundation. Colossal.

Tribute to Tigers,By the End of Tonight,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46413d1975652138ccf/1:1/w_160/94bfc9b0.jpg,2005-03-10 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1128-tribute-to-tigers/,Temporary Residence,"In the late 1990s, sincerity was emo's cachet. It was how the genre gained a foothold in a subterranean market dominated by punk's protestations and ska's smarmy sense of humor. So, nearly a decade after bands like Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate had the bright idea of uniting distortion and schmaltz in a minor key, who can blame the genre's descendants for wanting to have some fun? By the End of Tonight are the far-detached heirs to a complicated legacy. Their aptly-titled 2004 EP Fireworks on Ice was one of the more adventurous re-imaginings of emo since screamo's inexplicable one-night stand with the mainstream. The EP wedded paranoiac, Drive Like Jehu-esque melodies to the previously stepped-around realms of thrash metal and prog. On Tribute to Tigers, By the End Of Tonight flip the shit on its head, regressing from their cathartic, unselfconscious brand of emotional conflagrations to something slower, safer, and much less interesting. At five tracks, it's a wonder they aren't packaging the album as another EP. Opener ""4's, 5's and the Piano That Never Made It Home"" is an eight-minute mini-opera that proudly shows its framework. On that track, By the End seem to have overreacted to the wild-eyed excess of Fireworks: We hear each instrument clearly, but that's because the mix is watery; the band is flawless, but the players sound as if they're afraid of making mistakes. Unlike Fireworks, Tribute to Tigers was created in an actual studio; but paradoxically, the album sounds more amateurish than its predecessor. The best riffs are often pitted in opposite channels, where the guitars feel distended and have trouble blending. The boys don't feed off of so much as accede to one another. ""7:30 Easter Morning"" hops around a lot, but in a timid manner that's less exhilarating than their EP's frenetic perambulations. ""Tigers"" seems to be what they're driving for: A slow-burning epic that follows impulsive instrumental corollaries without losing its focus. Though sullied by a somewhat maudlin melody, it's the structural ideal By the End of Tonight should try to replicate. Avoiding the stop-on-a-dime changes and gloriously overemphasized climaxes that characterized Fireworks, Tribute to Tigers feels waify. The album proves that greater cogency doesn't guarantee success; only, perhaps, increased smoothness. When it isn't a plain bore, this gentler approach is pacifying--- the band often sound like a less stuporous Do Make Say Think-- but ultimately less gratifying.","Emo band By the End of Tonight loosened up and had fun on their Fireworks on Ice EP, but here they slow their tempos and play it relatively safe.

Sleepers,Rapper Big Pooh,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31b13d19756521389fb/1:1/w_160/5145f23b.gif,2005-03-10 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6943-sleepers/,6 Hole,"A reading from DSM-IV: The Phife Dawg Complex: The inability for a solo artist to repeat the tremendous success of a previous group or collective. Often marked by several substandard breakout attempts. Results in career paralysis, droves of guest appearances, and recurring bouts of the ""coulda's."" Correlates with indie rock's ""ex members of"" syndrome. Notable subjects include: L.A. Sunshine and DJ Easy Lee, Lonzo from World Class Wreckin' Cru, everyone in Boogie Down Productions except KRS and Biz, Cormega and AZ. It's more than a trope. If you're in a trio and two of the members blow up, you're done. Just retire and practice your storytelling for the kids. So for Big Pooh of N.C. heads Little Brother, the odds certainly don't look promising. 9th Wonder dropped a career-changing (albeit mediocre) track on The Black Album and got nods for the Destiny's Child LP. Phonte caught a deal with BBE for Foreign Exchange's phenomenal Connected. All Pooh got is KC Royal Desi Relaford to back his release's label 6 Hole. Uh oh. To be fair, Sleepers isn't a freshman disaster on par with Phife Dawg's Ventilation: Da LP, but it's a far cry from Little Brother's The Listening. Fellow Justus Leaguer and Away Team beathead Khrysis's additions ""I Don't Care"" and ""Just Friends"" aren't quite on par with 9th's cuts. Unlike 9th, who excavates the classic dusty soul oeuvre, Khrysis merely copies-and-pastes elements without recomposing the original's character. The results are murky, almost organic rehashes. (Un)fortunately, Sleepers performs best as an imitation. Pooh and Phonte's lyrical handshakes feed the snaps and pops of ""Every Block"" with each of 9th's patent-pending staccatos. O-Dash (or is it Joe Scudda?) and Darien Brockington's talents help transform ""My Mind"" into a mournful, lovelorn whistler. But both cuts only mimic the best moments of Little Brother and the endless sundry of Justus League collabos. So what to do with Big Pooh? Sleepers is solid and avoids all the totemic markings of the subpar ""other dude."" And certainly Pooh is cognizant of his critics' free-rider accusations: ""You say 'Pooh, the weak nigga'/ I don't care"", he jests. But Pooh lacks Phonte's sense of humor and profound wit. Sleepers gives Pooh a headstart, but his sophomore release needs to sparkle if he's to avoid a seat next to Phife on the sidelines.","The only member of Little Brother who hasn't yet enjoyed success on his own, Big Pooh may have to go back to the drawing board.

Somber Wurlitzer,Greater California,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c019abf31b7dc71563e8/1:1/w_160/05602d93.gif,2005-03-10 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3671-somber-wurlitzer/,Earthling,"Greater California must believe in truth in advertising: They've titled their sophomore effort Somber Wurlitzer, and they ain't lying-- there is a lot of somber Wurlitzer on this album. Apparently the band acquired one as they began to write the album, and the instrument became the sonic foundation of the record. I've heard it said that the whole thing was recorded in sessions scheduled for the middle of the night, which also makes sense. Between the Wurlitzer's full-bodied, rounded sound and the generally chilled mood of the writing and playing, the album has a subdued, reflective tone, albeit with a healthy rhythmic underpinning. Whichever of the band's four members sings lead (all are simply listed in the liners, and all are multi-instrumentalists) sounds a fair bit like this Ben Gibbard fellow we've been hearing so much about lately, but the Death Cab/Postal Service references don't take you much further than that. Being a band named for the Golden State, it's unsurprising to hear some Beach Boys threads weaving their way through the mix, like the xylophone that duets with the vocals on ""May Day"", as prime an example of the band's basic sound as I could name. The painterly drums are recorded with a wide-open feel, slung low in the mix to propel the big, bounding Wurlitzer chords and swirls of Mellotron, Hammond, and Chamberlin. The languid verses are balanced by rhythmically dynamic refrains that serve as mini-climaxes. The half-time lope of ""In Scarlet""-- with jangling guitars rising to presage the sweetly layered harmonies-- makes it easy to imagine Greater California opening for Kingsbury Manx (indeed they have), and they build the song into a nice start-stop passage that gives way to an acoustic verse and a cascading return of the keyboards an electric guitars. Though the general quality is high, two songs in particular demonstrate the band's talent for songcraft. ""Patterns"" shifts between swelling, buzzing instrumental passages and big, whispy harmonies drawn into thin contrails by reverb. The band also adds an oscillating coda that nicely tricks you into expecting a build-up that never comes. Even better is ""Looking In"", a beguiling thing decked out with a jeweled chorus and vaporous vocals that nonetheless coalesce into an ear-grabbing hook. With all that Wurlitzer, the album could feel monochromatic, but the instrument acts more as a sonic signature than a gimmick, and the sounds around it vary enough to maintain one's interest. The album starts much stronger than it ends, with a couple of rather inconsequential instrumentals and a weak title track near its close. But even those aren't bad, and ultimately Somber Wurlitzer is a record in which you can make yourself at home.","Greater California weren't kidding around when they named this album-- a somber Wurlitzer serves as its signature sound.

Andrew Bird & the Mysterious Production of Eggs,Andrew Bird,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b59d034d5c69bf2c70/1:1/w_160/894e8bbd.jpg,2005-03-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/714-andrew-bird-the-mysterious-production-of-eggs/,Righteous Babe,"This album begins with Andrew Bird referencing Wagner's epochal ""Ride of the Valkyries""; it ends with a narrator asking someone to sing him ""Happy Birthday"" ""like it's gonna be your last day on earth"". In between are disheartening references to psychoanalysis, economic ruin, the slow death of living, and couplets such as: ""You're what happens when two substances collide/ And by all accounts, you really should have died"". But while the lyrics here are the stuff of sleepless nights and empty liquor bottles, the sonics belie any gloom or doom. The music on Eggs is ebullient, starting with a nameless, minute-long intro that features Bird's winding wind-swept violin and beguiling whistling. That's right, whistling-- he's credited as a ""professional whistler"" in his bio, and since he can make the breath passing between his lips sound like a singing saw or a radiant theremin, I'm willing to take him at his word. As for the violin, Bird's trademark instrument-- it's all over the album, but it's not what the album is about. Any plucking or sawing or twittering is done in service of the track at hand, not as a grand flourish of technique. The CD's accompanying insert features fantastic illustrations by Jay Ryan, one for each song on the album. At first glance, Ryan's drawings look like half-finished sketches, with faint pencil marks still visible in the finished picture. These sketch lines, rather than making the artwork seem sloppy or half-ass, give the pictures a sense of motion, a frisky kinetic energy reflected in the music. Whether the song is slow and somber, like the gentle ""Masterfade"", or contagiously upbeat, like Bird's musical nod to ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", ""Fake Palindromes"", there's a looseness and freshness to the playing. Even though this record took three years to finish, it has the life and verve of a one-take, time-is-money recording session. Such verve is also evident in the words themselves. For the most part, Bird eschews straight-forward storytelling, opting instead to drench the listener with wordplay and imagery. He might send you to the dictionary a few times, but there's nothing wrong with a little research. He might also sideswipe you with seemingly random lines-- ""Memories like mohair sweaters/ Stretched and pilled faux distressed letters/ Moose's horns and figure eights/ White plastic bags in search of mates""-- but Bird's love of language is so evident in lines like this that it's easy to forgive him his excesses and missteps. All this talk about lyrics isn't to say they'll ever get in the way of enjoying the record. They're there if you want them, but you can still savor the fantastic popcraft of Eggs without giving a damn about what's being said. Andrew Bird's voice is the spoonful of sugar that makes this medicine go down so smooth. Much like his violin playing and his whistling and his songwriting, Bird's voice is versatile, simultaneously recalling Paul Simon's conversational croon, Rufus Wainwright's self-aware drama, and Thom Yorke's mournful wail. He can hang on one word and give it emotional heft, and he can nail a line like ""and I'm gonna tie your wrists with leather/ and drill a tiny hole in your head"" with the nonchalant whimsy it requires. Ultimately, whimsy leavened with wisdom and humor is what typifies this album. When Bird sings, ""Sing me 'Happy Birthday'/ Sing like it's going to be your last day,"" it's a call for carpe diem, not a requiem. The Mysterious Production of Eggs might wrestle with unsavory topics, but it does so with a shrug of the shoulders, a wry smile, and a heart full of awe-inspiring song.","Andrew Bird's latest retains his sense of songcraft but eschews straightforward storytelling, opting instead for wordplay and imagery.

I mean rawk. I mean raunchy songs about sleazy fucking and raunchy guitar that squeals like a guitar sleazily fucking. I mean paunchy guys with eyeliner muttering, ""Who's your daddy?"" in fake British accents, and you know they're serious about their raunchy sleazy guitar fucking or else their whole fucking act is a fucking act. Rawk! These guys will steal your girlfriend and knock her up in your Econoline van, but they'll do it sensitive-style, like: ""Hey carrot juice, I wanna squeeze ya every way until ya bleed."" That's from their super-rad hit single ""Finding Out True Love Is Blind"", which is Julian Casablancas singing the Stones' ""Some Girls"" or the ""About a Million Girls"" song from The Simpsons over the chords from Green Day's ""Brain Stew"" played through Jack White's distortion pedals. Plus it has a beat you can dance to, but that's OK because chicks dig that shit. This album has raunchy sleazy guitar solos, like on opener ""Louis XIV"", which sounds like Noel Gallagher fucking AC/DC's guest list in assless chaps. Lead Louis man Jason Hill tells MTV that I've never heard T. Rex, and of course he's right. I haven't heard Mark E. Smith, either, but my pansy-ass neighbor says something called Art Brut ""does more with Smith's influence."" Plus, he says make-out anthem ""Marc"" sounds like a Ben Folds post-Five piano ballad with delusions of ""Life's a Gas""-like grandeur instead of humor or melodicism. Twerp doesn't get half the tang I do, though. Rawk! These songs have lyrics that don't have to make sense because the guy singing them is too busy with raunchy sleazy fucking for all that shit; lines like ""you said so in a letter that said return to sender, my illegally illegal tender."" Timeless, yes, but Hill's words are timely, too: ""weapon of mass destruction"" in a rawk song? What next? There's also an instrumental, ""Louis Reprise"", which starts like the Beatles' ""The End"" from Dad's classic rock station but swerves into fiddles and horns, like a more frat-ready Dave Matthews Band, whose concert last year almost got me stoned and laid, so whatever. Fuckin' rawk! One bummer: No actual swearing. The ""parental advisory"" sticker is just for the cover, which is worth the price alone if only as proof you're not a homo even though you just bought a record named after a French historical figure (like John Kerry, haw haw), unless the chick's really a dude like on that Roxy Music album under my bed.

Rounded out by the formidable rhythm section of bassist Ingebrigt Håker Flaten and drummer Paal Nilssen-Love (both members of Mats Gustafsson's the Thing, among countless other credits), Scorch Trio produce a particularly ornery form of incendiary fusion, a hybrid strain that bears nearly as much resemblance to over-driven rock trios like Cream or Band of Gypsies as it does to avant-jazz guitarists such as Sonny Sharrock and Nels Cline. However, thanks in part to the group's extemporaneous recording style, compositional interests get short shrift on Luggumt; instead, the musicians focus almost exclusively on uncorking their inner genies. And though this approach results in some bone-powdering displays of rabid virtuosity and group interplay, it does not do wonders for the album's staying power. As many guitarists do, Björkheim unabashedly uses Hendrix as his sonic point of disembarkation. This is never more evident than on the 12-minute opening epic ""Kjøle Hole"". Strafing torrents of sparks like an errant tommy gun, Björkheim's playing is an unstoppable natural force, his every rapid-fire note articulated so precisely it sounds as though he's using a straight razor for a pick. A few minutes into this attack his tone takes on an unearthly, almost robotic-sounding distortion. As the track progresses it takes on a pronounced metallic edge, and towards its end there are a couple note-heavy passages that sound similar to Van Halen's ""Eruption""-- a development I didn't exactly find unwelcome. Elsewhere on Luggumt, the Trio wisely monitor their pace, allowing spacious tracks like ""Synnja Vegga"" and ""Snaeke Rojnd Naevinj"" enough fresh oxygen and legroom that each individual sound is able to appeal for a listener's attention. Throughout the album, Håker Flaten and Nilssen-Love perform yeoman's work to keep the proceedings from collapsing under the considerable weight of Björkheim's onslaught. Nilssen-Love in particular is an utter maniac, never neglecting any portion of his drumkit for any significant length of time (although there are several points when he probably could benefit from being stingier with the cymbals). As often can be the case with live free/improv recordings, Luggumt's charms are most blisteringly evident on first hearing, and incongruously enough this album is perhaps best enjoyed via infrequent listens, so that the peaks and troughs of the Scorch Trio's rugged topography are better able to retain their moments of unexpected alien beauty.","The aptly-named Rune Grammofon band features some of Scandinavian free music's most highly regarded player.

The result is a collage of words that may or may not make sense, but is bound to be interesting. The approach-- named after one of its first notable results: translated, ""the exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine""-- was also employed by painters, as well. The historically minded Daedelus has used that method to construct his latest album, bringing in a disparate group of artists-- rappers, singers, poets, and producers-- to contribute to his usual palette of whimsical field recordings and downtempo beats. Working with both sonics and language, the LP highlights the power of collage art. On ""Impending Doom"", an appropriately titled collaboration with MF Doom, the emcee does well with Daedelus' irregular beat. Doom sounds comfortable in this setting, and the song's lo-fi sample of swooning strings could have easily slipped onto Madvillainy. Also right at home among Daedelus' vintage soundscapes are rap group CYNE on the slick jazz-rap throwback ""Drops"" and poet Mike Ladd on the coffeehouse thump of ""Welcome Home"" (reprised earlier by Prefuse 73). But as it was with the old word game, the more vivid or unusual your contribution, the better the ""corpse"" collage. When Daedelus is given some linear acoustic guitar picking and vocals from One AM Radio's Hirshikesh Hirway in ""Thanatopsis"", he pulls out an unexpected, fresh vocal sample that blurs the line between scat and Prefuse-style manipulation. ""Now and Sleep"" veers from music-hall piano into harsh, industrial drones, but singer Laura Darling keeps it as soft as a lullaby. And the rappers in TTC would sound strange in any context, but the way they ride that light bell sample in ""Cadavre Exquis"" evokes an ominous, narrow, after-hours Parisian street. For better or worse, Daedelus lets his guests walk all over him, tailoring his compositions around their contributions. Unfortunately, although Daedelus' work is often dynamic, his guest-first approach prevents him from moving away from his typical sonic style. The result is an album that's exciting solely because of its guest contributors, but exciting nonetheless.","MF Doom and singer Laura Darling are among the guests on Daedalus' mix of whimsical field recordings, downtempo beats, and Surrealist-inspired concepts.

The Zutons have had to watch all their positive press be tempered by a slew of comparisons to fellow Liverpool-born, NME darlings the Coral (""cosmic scouse"" is the proper genre name, for those prone to keeping track). Happily, the Zutons' multi-decade larceny is more decisive and inventive than anything the Coral have unleashed: Loopy, spastic, and perpetually impassioned, the Zutons squeal and kick like a scrubbed-up Deadly Snakes, flitting from weird, Devo-inspired disco jerks to steel-led country mourning to sax-driven swamp-funk. Ultimately, all the Zutons and the Coral actually share is a producer (the Fall and Echo and the Bunnyman twiddler Ian Broudie), a label (both are signed to UK indie Deltasonic), and completely incomprehensible accents. Tight and polished, Who Killed...the Zutons lacks a bit of the loose, spiraling vehemence of the band's live show, but vocalist Dave McCabe is so unconscionably prone to moments of unwound ferocity-- twitching and squealing with microphone-eating fervor-- that his shrieks alone are more than enough to make up for the record's otherwise-alienating sheen. Likewise, saxophonist Abi Harding, who seems half-schooled in the finer points of horn-blowing, adds a welcome touch of scrappy grace, tooting with haphazard glee. Packed with cowbell, handclaps, and twitchy disco rhythms, UK single ""Pressure Point"" (which was featured in a Levi's commercial earlier this year, soundtracking a dark-haired heroine's scramble up a tree while a dog chews her pants off), is, like much of who Who Killed...: tense, playful, and vaguely deranged, full of vocal hoots and loose, slinking drums. Opener ""Zuton Fever"" is a brash, self-referential mix of guitar diddles and sax puffs; ""Havana Gang Brawl"", with its urgent ""Where will you sleep tonight?"" queries is all nervous energy, heavy bass, and bleating vocals. Who Killed...the Zutons is an unexpectedly impressive start, consistently showcasing off the band's dynamic songwriting and penchant for weird, sprawling throwdowns-- maybe just enough to transcend all the front page exclamation points.","These Liverpudlians are starting to get some well-deserved attention in the U.S. for their blues-soul-punk pilfering.

The band is often described as sexually menacing, but the feeling here is more akin to a couple of best friends who toy with their sexual tension, fully realizing that doing anything about it would ruin everything. No Wow plots the wax and wane of relationships like this, as the duo drop the Velvet Underground curtain and spaz on each other in plain view. On the title track, they're talking shit and issuing challenges: Alison Mosshart scowls, ""You're gonna have to step over my dead body/ Before you walk out that door"" over Jamie Hince's steady rumbles and thrusts, the two taunting each other until the song explodes into a raunchy playfight chant. ""Love Is a Deserter"" threatens the firing squad if someone doesn't ante up, while ""Dead Road 7"" gets sick of the bullshit and shows you the exit sign. The mothballed drum-machine used on No Wow feels less a Suicide nod than a means to eliminate outside interference. It provides the cool, mechanical pulse for Hince and Mosshart's theatrics without getting in the way like a live drummer would. There's no ""hey, hey guys"" interventions from the dum-dum box, and the little robo-bastard gets his freak on throughout ""The Good Ones"", a pulsating convection whose video has onlookers infected by pink lust at the mere sight and sound of the Kills. ""I Hate The Way You Love"" and its ""Part 2"" comedown are Hince and Mosshart moving past the pseudo-drama, both attempting to prove each is more over it than the other. The former is a raucous ""whatever"" mock insult; the latter is a sappy, screeching acquittal mantra. The Kills pay tribute to the Benton Harbor, Mich., Meijer's supermarket on ""At the Back of the Shell"", a handclap-driven exposé of smalltown romantic endeavors. Hince's obsession with a rare Flickinger mixing board that was once coated in Sly Stone's coke rails led the pair to the Lake Michigan town that's as well known for its racist cops as it is for washing machines and Sinbad. Once there, they squatted in a studio and wrote the entire album in just over two weeks. Three weeks later, the record was finished. The expedited process lends No Wow an immediacy and rawness that enhances the band's intention to pare down the sound of their full-length debut Keep On Your Mean Side. The guns brandished earlier are holstered on ""Rodeo Town"" which is also the first song on the album to let Hince's guitar take a rest. It's country-fried jangle providing Mosshart the opportunity to stretch her vocal chords a bit. Hince's vocals are only separated once on the simmering ""Murdermile"" which also has Mosshart briefly revisiting her wailing days with Discount. Closer ""Ticket Man"" sends the band packing, exhausted and emotionally spent. Over a plodding piano, Mosshart pines, ""Too many tickets is the problem, man/ Too many problems is the ticket in my hand"". It's a fitting end to a fitful tantrum of a record. The Kills might wear their obsessions on their sleeve, but they wear them with pride. They follow the tradition of the tempestuous male/female sparring of bands like X and Royal Trux with an utterly current sense of uneasy self-awareness. No Wow steps up to the promise of their EPs and debut LP, a boisterous reminder that kids can still hook up to songs that are little more than a guitar and attitude. If that makes the Kills poseurs, they'd probably be the first to admit it.","The Kills wrote and recorded their second LP in just over a month's time, and that expedited process lends No Wow a raw immediacy that fits the band's tempestuousness and sexual tension.

Nano-Nucleonic Cyborg Summoning EP,Behold...the Arctopus,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47e9d034d5c69bf30a6/1:1/w_160/ec1940b8.jpg,2005-03-08 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1152-nano-nucleonic-cyborg-summoning-ep/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Don't be fooled by the flaming skulls and innumerable body piercings: Prog-metal bands are the geekiest collectives in contemporary music. They're geekier than video game cover bands. Even geekier than geek rock. When they're not sitting in their bedrooms memorizing scales and modes, they're performing finger exercises to increase things like pinky strength and pick speed. Behind every ass-kicking riff lies about a dozen years of neo-classical guitar lessons and privately-tutored ear training. On Behold...the Arctopus's second EP, Nano-Nucleonic Cyborg Summoning, the New York trio showcases years of extensive schooling on three incredibly dense prog-metal opuses, hardly coming up for air over the course of a furious 17-minute span. At the epicenter of this metal maelstrom is the touch guitar, or as Arctopus touch ax-man Colin Marston calls it, the ""12-string Hell-harp."" The monstrosity spans the range of both bass and guitar and its fret-tap friendly design would make any guitar shop employee shit his pants. But enough advertising, how valuable is this thing musically? Sure, Marston can bend, tap, trill, slap, and pluck to his heart's content, but as Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteem have demonstrated time and time again, technical prowess isn't necessarily equated with aesthetic success. For several instances on opener ""Exospacial Psionic Aura"", Marston and company appear to buck this trend. The jazz breakdowns, blistering arpeggios, and almost-catchy outro make it worth waiting through entire minutes of mindless Mixolydian mode improvising. Unfortunately, the band blows their load early here, leaving little creativity for the remaining two tracks. Frenetic pick scrapes and blitzkrieg cymbal crashes at 180 BPM can get awfully tedious after 17 minutes, and excepting the occasional acid-rock interlude, this is all the Arctopus pumps out. Metal-shredding guitars and machine-gun drumming should never become boring, but sadly the band's affinity for mathematical riffing and technical showmanship suck out all the fun. For a band whose moniker is a command, the Arctopus come off as pretty lackluster. And as for the ""12-string Hell-harp,"" I haven't seen ax gear this ridiculous since Spinal Tap's amps went to 11.","This prog-metal band hardly comes up for air over the course of a furious three-song, 17-minute EP.

Fright Makes Right,Coughs,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72d5e6ef95969320ef5/1:1/w_160/424d871b.gif,2005-03-08 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1797-fright-makes-right/,Load,"Down the mons and back up the vag, am I right? Prenatalism is the new futurism (which is also the old postnatalism): drummers yearn for their first belly kick, vox chicks their primal scream. A cough's a far cry from a scream-- heyo-- but like Schjeldahl said in praise of Twombly, this Chicago six-piece had to work pretty damn hard to sound so effectively purposeless, so magically prehumanstinctual. 'Nother words: baby Swans. Coughs are loud and droney and noise-bursty and the female lead singer sounds like Kim Deal (obviously). But unlike a lot of these amniotic noise-is-the-next-frontier ballsacs Coughs stay in the crib, drooling over their own toddler rhymes and popping off the milky noise teat we call time signatures, somehow never giving up the charade (except once, I'll get to it, something about a banjo). Even the alphabetical song ordering smells like Gerber baby: as if Coughs just greened out the tracks and Ma Load had to sequence them, aka the noise label diaper wipe. I know I'm making everything this band does sound so dreadfully important. Truth is most songs on Fright Makes Right are not hard-passed shits but gratuitous giggles. String out a Zulu Nation break and tap that Lord of the Flies beast called men's predisposition to backyard evil (""I killed a snake today!"" shout Coughs)-- that song's called ""Garter Snake"". ""Give Peace a Chance"" goes ""Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!""; ""Mail Order"" goes ""Stay in your house/ Never come out!""; ""Starchitect"" goes ""Frank Lloyd Wright! You're all right! I.M. Pei! You're OK!"" (Pei is ""pay,"" not ""pee"" didyaknow?). My favorite of this sort is Coughs' same-titled homage to Schoolhouse Rock's ""I'm Just a Bill"": The bill's vicious taunt, ""We're the architects of society!"" plays on the album title all too well-- if Bob Dorough had been covered by Josef Mengele. There's a saxophone, too. With such a fine line between virtuosity and complete horseshit (yes you, Coltrane), over time the instrument has rightfully secured a spot as incomprehensibility's choice musical avatar. First-lesson squawks and third-lesson flourishes stripe the disc, but Coughs totally tow the line on ""Elephant""-- with its reedy whole-note slams, East London cocked back guitar needling, and Ashlee pre-studio vocal-- and ""Narwahl"", a pleasant Sonic Youth rip. But let's talk about this banjo track. It's called ""Come Back to Me"", and like any banjo track it's simultaneously the best and worst track on the album. Best, because it's meant to be the best-- here Coughs freakfolk and sungtong counterpoint to the delight of us kids who didn't even know about Brian Wilson until last year. Worst though, because, as Glenn McDonald felt about ""One With the Freaks"" on the Notwist's Neon Golden, the song becomes Fright Makes Right's reverse blackhole, a pop gem that robs Coughs of their rub, the how-to magic show that betrays their sleights of hand. Coughs, cough, get in my belly.","Chicago-based Load Records sextet is loud, droney, and willing to pick up a banjo or a saxophone now and then.

Manzanita,Mia Doi Todd,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ce13d19756521394e1/1:1/w_160/37aab711.jpg,2005-03-08 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8092-manzanita/,Plug Research,"For three albums, Mia Doi Todd communicated to listeners using two instruments-- her guitar and her voice. On her fourth album, The Golden State, she put herself in the hands of producer Mitchell Froom, a man not exactly known for musical restraint. In conjunction with Todd and co-producer Yves Beauvais, Froom decorated the album (containing both new and old songs) with ornate, luxurious arrangements that at once pushed things forward while remaining true to the unadorned heart of Todd's music. Though that record seemed superficially like a departure from her previous work, it fit in just fine with what preceded. For her newest album, Manzanita, Todd tried a different tact-- instead of gussying up her usual types of songs, she takes the opportunity to digress in unexpected directions, with equally unexpected results. Opener and Dead Meadow collaboration ""The Way"" is a psych-damaged protest song that would probably be better served in the hands of a histrionic harpy like Grace Slick. As is, Todd's plaintive pleas (""seems like paradise is lost and won't be found"") clash with the backwards guitars and the double-bass action. The lukewarm reggae workout ""Casa Nova"" is an even weaker genre exercise. More successful are excursions into Bacharachian horn and string charts (on ""The Last Night of Winter"") and flamenco-styled guitar strumming (on ""Tongue-Tied""). The high points of the album are the tracks that feature Todd by herself either on guitar or piano, filling the song with the trembling strength of her singing. Of course, mileage may vary concerning her lyrics, which can err on the side of simplicity and cliché redemption (""All the butterflies rise to the surface/ I say stupid things when I get nervous""). Her poetic voice is strongest when the words state their intentions in concise yet inventive ways (""We kiss for the first time, our lips and tongues tied in fitness, infiniteness""), or she finds contentment in the wonder of the everyday (""We woke up from dreams/ Took turns at the sink/ We crawl back into bed""). No doubt Mia Doi Todd's music is an acquired taste-- as offered in her press clippings, reactions range from orgiastic fawning (""[l]ike a 21st century Yeats she transforms our species' dilemmas, follies, and misery into cathartic beauty"") to unapologetic brusqueness (""jaw-droppingly pretentious""). Somewhere in between those two poles is a center where Todd's particular charms can be appreciated with the requisite grain of salt. While Manzanita tries to add more spice and panache to Todd's folk-flavored brew, the album works best when it stays true to the original recipe.","Folk minimalist splits her latest record between sparse songs and genre exercises.

Fear of a Black Tangent,Busdriver,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a401b1335d7bf1698864/1:1/w_160/445a3c66.jpg,2005-03-08 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1033-fear-of-a-black-tangent/,Mush,"Jabber-- numbing listeners with verbiage important or useless-- can be a weapon. That said, there is also a certain power in veering off into tangents, forcing a listener to follow stories and thoughts as they drift. Regan Farquhar (Busdriver) is an ace at tangents. On ""Unemployed Black Astronaut"", the MC begins by announcing, ""It's the resurgence of the happy black rappers."" He then sub-sonically narrates his rise to minor stardom as a rapper before reminding everyone that he is the first black astronaut to land on the moon in a hot-air balloon. Our man then blathers about rewriting Hollywood flicks to not have black men die in their opening scenes, telling of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons players mowing lawns for a living, comparing himself to the best of the Krush Groove DVD, and living off of chicken pot pies as he is a mere tax write-off for his record label. Fear of a Black Tangent, he calls his power. As heard in his last joint, Cosmic Cleavage, Farquhar continues his persona as a loser who chases his demons on a public bus or in a subway station. He typically sounds like David Allan Grier with amyl nitrate in the air. Our man raps in an ""ohmygawd this is sooo ridiculous"" tone that can make you either think he is a jackass or a jester. My instincts say it's the latter. Hell, on his self-introduction, ""Yawning Zeitgeist Intro (Freestyle)"", he says, ""Now, some of your friends will reboot and do a Google search and will be discouraged that the truth will hurt when they see that I'm not their zeitgeist, nor am I Christ-like, nor do I dislike whites. I just want a better chance as, most likely, I'll sell more records in France."" Amen. Daedelus, Omid, Nobody, Prefuse 73, and even Danger Mouse leave their fingerprints on the album's loose production, which samples everything from gothic, Aquarius-age organs and Roosevelt-era swing jaunts to Spaghetti Western ballads. Farquhar is a Charlie Brown of sorts, blaming artistic shortcoming on lousy choices (""What kind of name is Busdriver? Is it just a wack allegory? And can't it be justified by any background story?""). He cries that his music only appeals to ""hipsters dress like Russian spies."" Farquhar's self-loathing comes dangerously close to being wearisome until ""Befriend the Friendless Friendster"" kicks in, as he sing-raps and tap-dances with Irving Berlin on the gawddamn Ritz. And then there is the closer, ""Lefty's Lament"", where he retires in an elephant's graveyard of the American left wing. Poor sod.","Nasal, leftfield L.A. emcee gets production help from Prefuse 73, Danger Mouse, and Daedelus.

LateNightTales,The Flaming Lips,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0bd13d1975652138469/1:1/w_160/8ff719a9.jpg,2005-03-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3087-latenighttales/,Azuli,"Sometime between The Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, as the Flaming Lips earned a rep as the best live band on the rock circuit, they trained their fans to associate them not just with ear-splitting surreal pop and electric light-music orchestras, but with an entire mindset: the big grins, the man-sized fuzzy animals, and visions of gigantic beach balls gliding across the audience. In fact, the only song I remember them playing was ""Happy Birthday"". It's surprising that the Flaming Lips don't spend more time making lifestyle accessories; I'd pay top dollar for a day-glo pink inflatable recliner that comes with its own light show! This new mix disc, assembled for Azuli's LateNightTales series, is a perfect example of Lips-branded atmosphere. The album does more than showcase the band's taste in classic and contemporary pop; it sets a precise and peculiar mood, a kind of late-night sensation that's weightless but not silly, and askew but not deranged. Most of the tunes sound like they were made out of yawns, smoke, and sighs, and aside from a couple of bumps, it's an indisputable post-party mix. Oddly, the songs that least belong are the exclusive recordings. David Shirgley's ""The Jist"", a disturbing spoken word piece that feels like pure stoner talk, closes the album and overrides what could have been a blissful send-off courtesy of Brian Eno's ""Another Green World"". The other curveball is the Flaming Lips' cover of the White Stripes' ""Seven Nation Army"", a piece of sonic hostility with sirens, fuzzed-out riffs, and Coyne emoting through a megaphone. It's cartoonishly effective and less terse and gritty than the Stripes' original, but this isn't the side of the band you'd expect to hear on this mix; it's a nice hook for collectors, but not essential by itself. (You can hear the single at the start of their promotional Radio Mix, found online here.) The rest of the album is damn near sublime. Björk's ""Unravel"" ushers us in, and then gently segues to the champagne music of Miles Davis playing Gershwin's ""My Ship"". Sexual urges are sublimated throughout the album, evoking the late-night making out that it was built to soundtrack; on ""Speed of Sound"", Chris Bell makes a lyric about not getting laid sound like the ballad of the unknown soldier, while Nick Drake's ""River Man"" is a little too obviously the song where you should lean over and make your move. The Lips know how to use each song to bring out what's strange or special about the others, so that 10cc's ""I'm Not In Love"" sounds far more psychedelic here than it ever did on your mom's AM radio, and Radiohead's ""Pyramid Song"" shakes off any of the studied chilliness it absorbed from Amnesiac. And the album's good-natured, fun-and-shiny undercurrent explodes in cuts by the Chameleons and the Psychedelic Furs, which prove once again that you could make a mix disc for a funeral and there'd still be room for 1980s new wave. While the promotion for this album emphasizes how many years and styles it spans, anyone who's made an eclectic mix knows that finding what the songs have in common is more important than emphasizing what sets them apart. This record is perfect for the end of a night when the lines are getting blurry and no one has to move, or drive home, or even get up from where they're lying in the back yard, while the last strains of Eno greet the first bleed of dawn: What's this bubble we've landed in, and why does it ever have to burst?","On the latest installment of this compilation series, curators the Flaming Lips cover the White Stripes' ""Seven Nation Army"" and include songs by Brian Eno, Radiohead, Björk, Nick Drake, 10cc, the Chameleons, and others.

Expo,Marbles,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35113d197565213bce9/1:1/w_160/f1b228fb.jpg,2005-03-07 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5642-expo/,spinART,"It happens all the time: Perhaps feeling trapped by the constraints of his successful full-time band, a frontperson/main songwriter forms a side project or records a solo record. These efforts are often stylistic tangents, and while they can painfully suck-- proving that a good band is more than the sum of parts-- it's occasionally exciting to hear that songwriter's voice in a different context. That's not true here. Marbles was Robert Schneider's original recording moniker before he formed the Apples in Stereo, cranking out sloppy-but-charming four-track Beach Boys tributes that were compiled for 1997's Pyramid Landing and Other Favorites. Expo, however, is a planned and calculated Marbles full-length, recorded in the same room as Pet Sounds was, and mixed by the same engineer as Brian Wilson's revived Smile (Cello Studios and Mark Linnett, respectively). But instead of the Smile-stalking you'd expect from a guy who is known to have obsessively studied Wilson's studio techniques, Expo sounds like ELO via Gary Numan, with anachronistic electronic embellishments applied to inoffensive lite-FM melodies. While criticising the leader of the Apples in Stereo for sounding ""cartoonish"" would be ridiculous, his typically quirkly affectations are unbearable here, outside their usual rock context. ""Out of Zone"" has simple guitar lines and sheets of electronic drums and effects, over which Schneider harmonizes with himself on a breezy melody. It's characterized by meaningless lyrics that seem to exist only for the sake of rhyming, overbearing vocal effects, and outmoded production gimmicks. And this is one of Expo's catchiest songs. Elsewhere, ""Jewel of India""-- one of the record's three instrumental pieces-- was probably meant to evoke foreign landscapes, but its horn melody sounds more like a Casio PT-10. That and the blissed-out nature boy anthem ""Hello Sun"" sound like incidental music from Cannibal: The Musical without the intended humor. Later songs like ""Cruel Sound"" aren't as cluttered, but recall B-sides from the Apples' later work. At least this album is brief.","Apples in Stereo's Robert Schneider recorded the second Marbles full-length in the same studio that birthed Pet Sounds.

In the Fishtank 12 EP,Karate,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6ec0084474cd0c2864/1:1/w_160/a103bc7f.gif,2005-03-07 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4388-in-the-fishtank-12-ep/,Konkurrent,"For their In the Fishtank series, Konkurrent Records offers bands two days in the studio to air out ideas that might be out of place on those artists' usual records. Early entries included EPs by NoMeansNo, Guv'ner, and June of 44, but soon, the series evolved into a collaborative space, and counterintuitive pairings took over: Tortoise and the Ex, the Black Heart Procession and Solbakken, Low and Dirty Three (okay, that one isn't so counterintuitive). Karate's In the Fishtank EP brings the series full circle: They ""collaborate"" with Billie Holiday, the Band, Mark Hollis, and the Minutemen by covering them on this politically charged karaoke bash. It takes some balls to tackle such iconic songs, especially since Karate's versions of them are so straightforward and faithful. Or we could be cynical and call it stacking the deck: Short of reworking them as ska-punk anthems, is it even possible to make unpleasant versions of ""Strange Fruit"" or ""Tears of Rage""? Without revising the originals, Karate nudges them toward their own style-- a bit anesthetized, with a chilly precision bordering on blandness. The EP's breezy yet solemn demeanor seems to portend Pockets, which this EP was recorded right before, and their political themes would recur on Pockets songs like ""The State I'm in aka Goode Buy From Cobb's Creek Park"". Geoff Farina's singing is winningly elegant, but can be tough to reconcile with the real deals: Like a thick quilt laid across them, it only traces the broadest contours of Holiday's sweetly sinister warble on ""Strange Fruit"", Richard Manuel's soulful, honeyed drawl (or Dylan's magnetic rasp, depending on whether you take your ""Tears of Rage"" from The Basement Tapes or the Band's debut, Music from Big Pink), and Mike Watt's gruff bark on Minutemen covers like ""Bob Dylan Wrote Propaganda Songs"" and ""Only Minority"". But the ominous poignancy of Holiday's lynching lament remains intact, as Farina intones over shimmering chords and a liquid lead: ""Southern trees bear strange fruit/ Blood on the leaves and blood on the root."" And the Minutemen covers break up the dirges with up-tempo, jazzy pep talks for the workin' man. The only real downer is a ponderous cover of Talk Talk singer Mark Hollis's ""New Jerusalem"" that sheds some of the original's fragility in favor of overstated reverb chords and deliberate, melodramatic drums. It's the only song on the EP that eschews concise reproduction, and drives home the soundness of Karate's decision to play the others accurately, even if the end result may have you digging out your copy of What Makes a Man Start Fires for a sip of the source waters after a few spins.","The latest entry in Konkurrent Records' In the Fishtank series features Karate covering Billie Holiday, the Band, Mark Hollis, and the Minutemen.

They love hangar-sized, doomy, simple melodies played slooooooow, on Rapmaster keyboards that've spent some time in the shed with dad's Krylon. It's not scary or menacing but vaguely silly-- huge synths cycling in midair, sour and sagging. Not for nothing does MC Tinchy Strider politely suggest on ""Move"" that you bang your head. They probably picked it up through some perverted polyglot of drum & bass smog riffs and southern rap's Trans-Euro affectations. Wherever they got it, they may be the first act to come pre-screwed. (Blame English socialized medicine or the sleepytime effects of steak and kidney pie.) They also love silly bells-and-whistles-style tracks like ""Dirty"", featuring the first digitized slide whistle in history. (Hold tight MC Harpo.) These are really throwbacks to batshit hardcore bricolage like Hyper-On Experience's ""Imajika"" (""What's Opera, Doc?"" remade by Davy DMX). Grime's dirty little secret is that it's easier to sell column inches presenting East London as Bartertown 2.0 than admit that frothiness, sweetness, and hope are key parts of its experience. (Not that the MCs help destroy the illusion: Yeah, you're Pablo Escobar in a country with the same gun crime rate as Guam.) The problem with Guns & Roses is that there just aren't enough Ruff Sqwad tracks. For a putative calling card from one of the most powerful crews around, this thing is stuffed bow-to-stern (geddit?) with U.S. rap instrumentals. Grime crews have inscrutable taste in U.S. rap: Do they really listen to their own music and hear Ludacris' ""Splash Waterfalls"" or Black Rob's ""Whoa""? I thought grime was supposed to wipe away Brit-rap's presupposed serfdom to Source/Vibe rules. Grime people: The next time you look to our shores, throw on ""Crunk Music"" or ""Put Your Hood Up"" at +8 and go nuts. Alternately, you could just have faith in the spanking quality of your own music and say, ""fuck you very much"" to a country who doesn't know Dirty Danger from Dame Edna. (Also, could I ask for a moratorium on the sex raps? I don't need to know Oliver Twist's skeeting habits.) They could be saving their best stuff (wot, no ""Anna""?) for the always-promised debut album, thereby considerably devaluing the eBay vultures of 2015. (Not that it did Wiley any good: Nine hundred forty copies, you fuckers!) Bottom line is that you need to at least hear this if you're at all interested in grime, aka the most exciting music on the planet right now. (What else do you have to show for yourselves? The Paw Paw Bears playing courtly lute? Your banging fax machine?)

Popcorn Box,The Coctails,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72cc0084474cd0c0b23/1:1/w_160/5337b06c.gif,2005-03-07 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1796-popcorn-box/,Carrot Top,"The Coctails were one of the more unusual musical packages of the past 20 years: four talented multi-instrumentalists from Kansas City-- John Upchurch, Barry Phipps, Mark Greenberg, and Archer Prewitt-- whose music didn't fit any category even when it veered close to one. They dressed in matching yellow tuxedos, designed and printed their own ultra-retro concert posters, and wrapped their releases in packaging that looked alternately like something from the 50s Blue Note catalog or something from the coolest thrift store in the universe. The garish tuxes eventually became more stylish suits and the band uprooted for Chicago, where they established themselves as regulars at the legendary Lounge Ax venue (R.I.P.) and convinced the old Wax Trax! record store (R.I.P.) to let them erect three-foot-tall effigies of themselves in the front display window to promote their first album. (Those same papier mache figures now overlook the bar at Empty Bottle.) From their loft space, they ran two record labels-- Hi-Ball for their vinyl releases, Carrot Top for their CDs-- and recorded on old analog equipment with a menagerie of instruments that would make any instrument fetishist plotz. They were equally comfortable playing weddings or opening for Shellac or the Skatalites-- among the many great concert posters included in the liners of Popcorn Box Box, their new three-disc round-up of rarities, unreleased material, and select album cuts, is one that shows them opening for some band named Corndolly, with Liz Phair third on the bill. What's really remarkable about the Coctails, as this set amply demonstrates, is that in a decade when facelessness and a supposed lack of affect ruled the underground, and anonymous post-rock collectives lumbered their way to shining reviews, they made their faces into Beatlesque icons, wore their personalities on their sleeves, embraced comic book art and toys as promotional devices, and exuded humor, unfettered creativity, and high spirits. People try to point to the Coctails as a precedent for the regrettable lounge revival, but as this compilation attests, they aren't so easily pigeonholed: These guys interpreted Sun Ra, took the occasional turn into garage mayhem, recorded a superb album of alternately weird and elegiac jazz (Long Sound), cut holiday and children's records, covered Raymond Scott's cartoon scores, and set an excerpt of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot to music. Popcorn Box takes in most of this over the course of its three-plus hour runtime, cleaning out the vaults of worthy unreleased stuff and filling in the blanks for fans who can't locate the limited-run vinyl-only EPs and numerous compilation tracks the Coctails released in their six years together. It also does a nice job of not duplicating the band's other set of rarities and album tracks, The Early Hi-Ball Years, and offers just about anything you could reasonably ask of liner notes: archival photographs, album art, comic strips, concert posters, tracks notes with comments from the band, and a couple of heartfelt essays from Coctails associates and admirers. Though it does an excellent job of scraping together a huge amount of often difficult to find material, Popcorn Box is obviously not for everyone-- some people will find the abstract jazz that dominates disc three impossible to sit through, while others with be put off by the guileless goofing off of tracks like ""Donut Shoppe"" (""Pirates run the donut shoppe.../ They used to have a pirate ship but it sank"") and ""Abba-Dabba-Do-Dance"", a truly weird surf blues featuring lead vocals by a friend of the group that ends with the band collapsing in laughter. But lovers of pure sound will find plenty to embrace, from the interesting horn arrangements that populate the majority of the tracks to the heavenly bowed vibraphone of ""City Sun"" to the pretty jazz ballad ""Marseilles"" to the bastard klezmer touches that color much of disc two. Previously unreleased tracks like the crazy percussion, marimba, and sax (two of which Upchurch plays simultaneously) pile-up ""Skeleton Bones"", or the great surf-inflected pop song ""Hey Ho"", recorded at a ""beach party"" in the band's loft space, should be all the incentive fans of the band need to drop dime on this-- though there's plenty of added value for those who still need some convincing. The six-song EP of freaky, richly detailed instrumentals they recorded for John Flansburgh's Hello Records Club has been out of print for ages and makes a welcome return in its original running order at the beginning of disc one. It's actually one of their most solid, cohesive releases, immediately illustrating that the band's utilization of theremin, marimba, banjo, musical saw, and bass clarinet was never a gimmick, but rather a means to an end. That end is some of the most memorably loopy music in recent memory, a good time that wasn't afraid to play with dissonance or experiment with free jazz-based open melodic structure. Newcomers (most likely curious fans of Prewitt's solo work or the Sea & Cake) probably shouldn't start by tackling this box, which seems aimed at established fans-- Peel or The Early Hi-Ball Years are better starting points, or Long Sound for those more interested in the band's jazz leanings. For those who try it with open and eager ears, though, Popcorn Box is a rewarding look back at a truly singular band.","This lovingly compiled three-disc set collects rarities, unreleased material, and a smattering of album cuts from Archer Prewitt's high-spirited, often-humorous former band.

"Mind Fusion, Vol. 1 & 2",Madlib,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab699d034d5c69bf400c/1:1/w_160/fb84f51c.gif,2005-03-07 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8984-mind-fusion-vol-1-2/,Mind Fusion,"OK, so Madlib has logorrhea... but for beats. I don't know what that's called. But my mother has Munchausen Syndrome and tried to diagnose me with it last year. I think she called it scabies or something. But it turns out I just had ashy legs. So whatever my mother thought I had, Lib certainly got it bad. To be fair, we all have it. A restless, churning in our bellies to produce and/or download more music than is humanly possible to process and to share our discoveries with the world. So then we start mp3 blogs to serve as a testimony for how dedicated musicheads we are and how we have a lot of rare shit to drop on everyone. Somehow it makes all those hours of getting banned on Soulseek worthwhile. (How you gonna be greedy with music you didn't even buy?) Madlib's got the same problem, only Japanese labels conscript him to put out his digs and productions on super rare mixtapes. And our only option is to be selfish with his work several months later. The Mind Fusion set is really a glorified mixtape with Manuel Ocampo cover art. But if you love remixes and you crush on the Beat Conductor, the first CD is a wet dream. The exclusives range from the tek-ridden staccato refreak of Madvillain's ""Money Folder"" to a spitfire phantom organ dirge from Diverse on the unreleased ""Space Goat"". And to think the Japanese have been hoarding this stuff since last summer... Moreover, Madlib's remixes push his differing tastes in hip-hop through his personal beat appliances. As he's done with the bootleg Remixes 12"", Lib adds a patented new spin on classics and unclassics alike. So Mash Out Posse gets dressed up with a sinister juxtaposition: vaudeville keys and whip-snapping snares to evince Fame and Danzenie fiery verses on ""Stomp the Shit Out You"". Meanwhile, he reworks ""Who You Be"" from N.J. supercrew The Outsidaz with a laquered blip and ghastly organ without losing any of the energy from Red, Zee, or Pacewon's verbal claps. Volume 2 is less Madlib the producer than Madlib the listener. It's all straightforward funk and breaks from Madlib's crates including some classic material from Henry Franklin, Elvin Jones, Marcos Valle, and Pharoah Sanders. As a fan, Madlib's prolific nature is perfect satiation. Everything he thinks he releases, allowing diehards and admirers tremendous insight and perspective into his workings. And of course, nothing's nicer than Bobby Hutcherson with a filthy cymbal and cowbell.","OK, so Madlib has logorrhea... but for beats. I don't know what that's called. But my mother has ...

The Evens,The Evens,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfeeb335119a49ecdac/1:1/w_160/953714fc.jpg,2005-03-07 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2917-the-evens/,Dischord,"It's been nearly four full years since the release of Fugazi's The Argument, which, by some distance, qualifies as the longest dry spell of new Ian MacKaye material in his storied, 20-plus year recording career. The Fugazi faithful, however, will be continuing their patient vigil for fresh music from the full group: MacKaye has instead turned his eye-- at least for now-- to a new project, the Evens. A duo comprised of MacKaye and former Warmers drummer/vocalist Amy Farina, the Evens distill Fugazi's familiar locomotive post-hardcore down to its barest essentials. Utilizing casually rich vocal harmonies and the bubbling warmth of baritone guitar, the Evens re-address the steadfast themes of MacKaye's work dating back to his Minor Threat days: contempt for the tyranny of petty authority, dismay at the disintegration of local community, and a passionate conviction in critical thinking and self-reliance. But thanks to the intimacy of the Evens' approach (as well as to their impressively well-developed melodic sensibilities), the album displays a beguiling tenderness not often present in MacKaye's previous efforts, a laid-back, disarming sweetness that causes the Evens' eponymous debut to feel like his most personal work to date. The Evens positively brims with revelations, not least of which is the consistent effectiveness of MacKaye's singing voice. Though melodic Fugazi tracks like The Argument's ""Cashout"" or ""I'm So Tired"" from the Instrument soundtrack have hinted at the broader possibilities of his vocal range, his work here represents the first time he's wholly abandoned his trademark rottweiler bark for an album's entirety. Here his vocals are particularly appealing when closely coupled with Farina's, whose bracingly cloudless voice proves to be an ideal match for MacKaye's weathered, pliable delivery. Farina, however, is far from merely MacKaye's supporting player, and thoroughly establishes herself as a fully vested partner. Her lead vocals on tracks like ""Around the Corner"" and ""If It's Water"" spur pleasant memories of the early-90s heyday of femme-led indie outfits like Tsunami or Scrawl, and her inventive, textured percussion serves to remind the listener how boring and perfunctory the majority of rock-based drumming actually is. When paired with MacKaye's restless, rumbling baritone guitar, her low-lit drumming can cast tracks (particularly ""Sara Lee"" or ""Minding One's Business"") in alluring, almost Tortoise-like post-rock hues, which provides the album with incredibly vivid depth of field, despite the duo's simplified, modest palette. Though powerhouse tracks like ""All These Governors"" and ""You Won't Feel a Thing"" pack the strongest initial mule-kick (closely related to such Fugazi anthems like ""Keep Your Eyes Open"" or ""Great Cop"", both songs come equipped with classically direct MacKaye choruses like, ""They'll beat you with the truth so you won't feel the lies"") many of The Evens' most memorable moments occur within the intimate portraiture of ""Blessed Not Lucky,"" or the opening ""Shelter Two"". Cataloging the minute details of a new relationship, ""Shelter Two"" makes a trip to the hardware store sound like high adventure, as MacKaye and Farina sing, ""We keep on climbing but we never find the top/ It's all downhill from here,"" in untailored Exene-and-John Doe harmonies, sweetly punctuating the importance of these crucial, seemingly trivial moments that so often comprise the highlights of our lives. There are occasions when the album too closely resembles the skeletal, unfinished demos that bulked up the Instrument soundtrack, and others where one can't help but imagine how Fugazi might've handled these songs. (I suspect the Canty/Lally rhythm section could absolutely pulverize ""You Won't Feel a Thing"" in a live context-- or at least I'd like to hear them try.) Ultimately, though, this eponymous debut not only introduces the Evens as a wholly distinct and vital group, but also contains performances that MacKaye would likely have been unable to deliver in any other context.","Ian MacKaye teams with former Warmers drummer/vocalist Amy Farina for his first LP of new material since Fugazi's The Argument. The album displays a beguiling tenderness not typically present in MacKaye's previous efforts, a laid-back, disarming sweetness that causes this to feel like his most personal work to date.

Hurricane Bar,Mando Diao,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c442ea9e61561daa80ec/1:1/w_160/e73d00de.jpg,2005-03-06 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5558-hurricane-bar/,Mute,"Mando Diao are a rock group from Sweden who've patterned themselves, in look and sound, after 1960s Mod culture, yet are signed to the otherwise electronic-oriented Mute label. We could lump them in with their countrymen like the Hives, Sahara Hotnights, and International Noise Conspiracy, but we can all leap for the buzzer to see who spots those bands' influences the fastest. You can do the same for Mando Diao who graft British Invasion melodies over garage-rock riffs. It's a simple formula, and one they got plenty of mileage out of on their debut, Bring 'Em In. Follow-up Hurricane Bar was produced by Richard Rainey, perhaps best known for working on U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind. Their approach hasn't changed much, but the scales have tipped considerably away from garage-rock enthusiasm and towards Anglophile melodies. In doing so, Hurricane Bar has diluted the two things that made Mando Diao's first album distinct: immediacy and a sense of fun. Bring Em In split the songs between two singers, Björn Dixgärd and Gustaf Norén, though the lion's share of memorable melodies went to Dixgärd. Things are inverted this time, with Dixgärd limited to five of 14 tracks and one extra chorus on ""God Knows"". That's unfortunate, because Dixgärd's throaty Vegas crooning sounds effortless and soulful. Norén carries the melodies just fine, but there's a difference between carrying and selling, as evidenced by ""God Knows"", on which Norén plays second banana in the verses and Dixgärd walks away with the album's catchiest melody. Norén's raspy, nasal voice fits the Brit Invasion-biting melodies better than the band's garage rock tracks, and since this LP has more stuffy ballads and Libertines-aping songs than stompers, perhaps that's why he's taken the lead. But while it's true that on this album the band displays more range-- including new touches such as the piano break in ""You Can't Steal My Love"" or the serene ""Ringing Bells""-- I'd rather take generic revivalism with energy and a charismatic singer over an album that's simply derivative.","On their second LP, Mute's Swedish mod revivalists display more range but less energy.

Arrived in Gold,Sightings,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f35e6ef95969320766/1:1/w_160/8ece32c5.gif,2005-03-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7145-arrived-in-gold/,Load,"Despite shredding at high volumes, New York City's Sightings remain a shadowy entity in comparison to critically lap-danced Big Apple ""noise"" acts like Black Dice and No Neck Blues Band. It's an unfortunate lapse, especially when considering the trio's newest tour de coarse, Arrived in Gold. One of 2004's most overlooked gems, the album's eight tracks channel-surf Pussy Galore's murky ""fuck you"" and DNA's angular, minimalist tribal scarification. It's Sightings fourth album, and it's a compositional breakthrough, upping antes from the scattershot conveyer-belt white noise of 2003's Absolutes, 2002's Michigan Haters, and the band's self-titled debut, sans appreciable intensity loss. Purists take note: The trio's piled their signature feedback drift/burst/smash/crash on top of addictive Liquid Liquid-like grooves. The magnetic harshness is sometimes reminiscent of the Chromatics, though with scrappier, more grating skree bursts and less dependency on straight-up rock rhetoric. (Not to belabor, but it'd be safer to stick with the P-cat references, especially during Sugarshit Sharp's dim-lit basement strangulation.) Recorded by Brooklyn magnate Samara Lubelski of The Tower Recordings/Hall of Fame, who also guests on violin, it's the band's most spic-and-span sounding refuse to date. Opener ""One Out of Ten"" offers a nice bridge from Absolutes-- five minutes of plug/unplug patterns, jittery feedback, bass blurts, whispered vocals, and pulsations. It picks up steam incrementally, ultimately forming a low-level dervish. (And buried beneath this collapsing swarm of bee-shells is a fragile, perfectly recorded, darning-needle piano.) ""Sugar Sediment"" is assembled over an unending, mid-tempo drum roll, smoky but pristine guitar notes, Mark Morgan's intermittent whispers, and unidentifiable drilling noises. The guitar (hearkening to Sun City Girls' Torch of the Mystics) and gently loping drums remain in strict holding pattern(s), but the feedback and buzz/smash floats freely, darting into areas not covered by the song's entropic core. The album's shiniest moment is ""Internal Compass"". Its skronk catchiness re-inscribes a bit of Liars' clockwork drum rambling with a guitar-as-percussion and eventual six-string turbo launch reification. Through his table-saw fretwork, Morgan snarls and growls and sing-talks about who-knows-what, though I kept hearing echoes of Mr. Albini and his kerosene. ""Switching To Judgement"" and ""Odds"" are both reminiscent of the serious post-SY junkyard sci-fi of San Diego rockers, Kill Me Tomorrow. ""The Last Seed"" is a return to fragmentary striations; it features bleeps and blonks and the vocal effects of Fusetron honcho Chris Freeman, who calls the geometry of his slogging, ""vocussion."" Closer ""Arrived in Gold, Arrived In Smoke,"" is a 10-minute panorama, blending the collection's strands of freeform blazing/lapidary percussive undertow into a resilient draft of iron filings. By song's end, the movement is compressed into airy swirls of pitter-pat percussion, Morgan's near-silent throat clearing, and slow-mo whirlpool action. The piece actually dissipates, implodes, and turns to a spray of near-silent dust particles. It's an enjoyable arsenal, but in a scene that surprisingly lacks intriguing characters (I can't count the A.R.E Weapons dudes), another engaging Sightings detail is aforementioned guitar/vocal cynic, Mark Morgan. Asked about the possible connection to amply referenced NYC art rockers Pussy Galore via their Pussy Gold 5000 album, Morgan responded: ""Definitely no Pussy Galore action. We ain't down with band referencing. Man, I can't honestly even remember what the title means. Some low-rent surrealism, I guess."" And queried weeks earlier about the history of NYC's influence on his output-- brought to mind by Kill Your Idols, a 2004 documentary by SA Crary that draws parallels and divergences between the original No New York no wave scene and the summer of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs circa 2002-- Morgan said, ""It sounds like a load of shit to me. I get the impression that just because these bands are from the same city, there is some need to connect them even though 20 some years separates the post-Seinfeld now from the teetering on bankruptcy then. Personally, the historical music continuum of NYC has just about zero effect on my thinking and playing music (in terms of like, dude, Mars rocked this town too). I rocked out more to Mars/DNA when I lived in Michigan than living in NYC."" Complicating the charisma, Sightings have frequently been playing live with To Live and Shave in LA's Tom Smith, another certifiable whip-smart smart-ass and damn-near autistic performance maestro. (And in 2003, Sightings/Smith recorded an album, Gardens of War.) It might seem a bit daft to offer minute descriptions of the band's musicality only to pull back and shit out a two-bit People Magazine character study, but today's wimpy, too-polite-because-I-want-a-record-deal version of the old-guard needs that sort of thing, and it ought to be recognized when it shows up to dinner.","Load Records noise artists pour blistering feedback over addictive, Liquid Liquid-like grooves.

You Fail Me,Converge,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6579d034d5c69bf34f1/1:1/w_160/9f2d0e6f.jpg,2005-03-06 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1595-you-fail-me/,Epitaph,"Despite their tendon-tearing, odd-time calisthenics, tech-metallurgists Converge are just a bunch of dudes with guitars. Oh, but they're not. They're good at deceiving us: What hits the tongue like straight blitzkrieg metal leaves a peculiar aftertaste. It isn't always easy to find the mosh-pulse at the center of You Fail Me, Converge's seventh and definitive album, so unless you don't mind a stiff neck, you might want to internalize these songs before rushing out to the band's live show. Converge are some of the most fearsome technicians in metal, but unlike Dillinger Escape Plan, whose songs are like feats of 22nd-century civic engineering, they're unusually organic. You Fail Me is all hardscrabble local hardcore in its gritty viscera. Ever maturing and honing, Converge have maintained a fairly consistent sound over their nearly 15-year career, so how does You Fail Me differ from cult classics such as Jane Doe and When Forever Comes Crashing? For one, the band have jumped ship from Equal Vision Records-- a veritable subterranean hardcore dynasty and Converge's home for the better part of the last half-decade-- to quasi-major Epitaph. You Fail Me is a more polished album, but this works to their advantage: Not only have Converge retained (even sharpened) their razorblade cut, they're now bolstered by a brawny low-end. Jacob Bannon's vocals are mixed lower than on previous efforts-- a popular metal technique-- and though his sautéed larynx is still a distinctive part of the mix, it takes on a comelier, more elemental quality. The real magic of the record lies in its pacing. You Fail Me is Converge's first capital-A album. The one-two combo of ""First Light"" and ""Last Light"" is an auspicious opening. In the former, Kurt Ballou's echoey guitar peals are a perfect prelude to one of the band's most concussive, exacting and anthemic songs. Ever. ""Last Light"" is inestimably great, industrially precise but quaking with vitality. Ballou even squeezes in a reprise of his opening cadenza before the super-colossal breakdown, which somehow manages to reign in the song's momentum without sacrificing velocity. You Fail Me never peters out. Converge are still programmed for hyper-speed, but Ballou throws in some artier stuff where he can, leveling ""In Her Blood"" and ""Hanging Moon"" with fairer-- if not quite huggable-- melodies. Can you spell 5/4 without prog? ""Heartless"" can; its jaunty odd-meter intro is almost danceable, in an early Dismemberment Plan sort of way. The album's totemic centerpieces-- the title track and ""In Her Shadow"", which combined account for a third of its runtime-- juxtapose the album's densest and most pastoral moments without seeming forced. Fifteen years is a long fucking time. And yet Converge still look young, to say nothing of the way they play. There's always something to be said for sticktuitiveness, but the unbroken lineal ascent of Converge's ouvre is a lesson to those of us who thought we'd long outgrown our scene days: Don't judge too soon, for the dudes in cuffs may yet return to kick your perfidious ass.","On their Epitaph debut, veteran metal band Converge sound more polished but no less ferocious.

The Massacre,50 Cent,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8cc0084474cd0c2d15/1:1/w_160/4c34432a.jpg,2005-03-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3046-the-massacre/,ShadyAftermath,"Last week, on New York's Hot 97 FM, 50 Cent dismissed The Game from G-Unit, after Game had professed earlier to the same station that he wouldn't mind recording with some of 50's sworn enemies (namely Nas and Jadakiss). Shortly thereafter, a young man was shot non-fatally in the leg at Hot 97, while 50 was still on-air, and gunfire was purportedly heard outside the offices of Violator, 50's management. That he started flexing his godfatherish persona mere days before he dropped The Massacre led some to speculate whether the whole thing was one ill-advised publicity stunt meant to invigorate his buzz and boost sales. As if to confirm the hunch, according to allhiphop.com, a week later, 50 was downplaying the whole ordeal, telling ""106 & Park"", ""A lot of things you hear out there is being said for shock value and not really as serious as people make it out to be."" Bullets don't joke. But while the ""publicity stunt"" analysis underestimates code of honor (and overestimates 50's and Game's collective rationality), you can't fault a kid for thinking like that. The Massacre, after all, tails 50's stratospherically successful Get Rich or Die Tryin' (which has thus far sold over 11 million copies); its release date had already been pushed back a month, and the two singles prefacing The Massacre-- ""Disco Inferno"" and ""Candy Shop""-- are flaccid reprises of other tracks both in beats and in timbre. (The former, of Lloyd Banks' ""On Fire"", beats by Eminem; the latter, 50 and Lil' Kim's ""Magic Stick"".). It's ironic that some of 50's best verses right now are his guest spots on The Game's The Documentary (particularly ""Hate It or Love It"" and ""How We Do""). The man's underperforming lyrically on The Massacre, but he stretches and croons and assures us a $50-million paycheck and a gigantic mansion in Connecticut have not expired his steely street soldiering: He's riding on the narrative and tough-mugging that got him here. And yet, The Massacre's best tracks have 50 dropping club-clatter and gangster lean to show us the mind behind the six-pack, gat, and Teflon. Clued in by an intro skit in which a sweet-sounding young damsel receiving a Valentine gets blasted by bullet-spray, we get it: 1) He's rich, and 2) He'll get you first. This is 50's massacre, no mercy. Scarface is in da club. It's followed by a series of guttural threats and luggish offerings to snuff anyone to save face-- ""y'all know what I'm about,"" 50 reminds us more than once. And in case we don't, he hits us with indelible, existential gloom, especially on ""This is 50""'s ominous piano plinking and the funereal low-end synths of ""I'm Supposed to Die Tonight"", where his warnings are cut directly from mobster cinema: ""Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with, son/ 'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done/ It's elementary, life is but a dream/ You know, row row your boat/ Your blood forms a stream."" Delving further into his macabre imagination, the lyrically weak ""Piggy Bank"" lets up for comic relief, poking half-assedly at Jadakiss, Nas, Kelis, and Ja Rule, framed in a sort of ""nanny-nanny-boo-boo"" chorus for the ridonkulously wealthy. Dissing Fat Joe, he stumbles into the feeble line, ""That fat nigga thought 'Lean Back' was 'In Da Club'/ My shit sold 11 mil/ His shit was a dud,"" after which the hook bragging ""yeah yeah mo' money mo'money,"" creates a reasonable facsimile of oinking. He taunts everyone in the outro: ""Y'all gotta do something now... everybody's watching... rep your hood, nigga,"" whilst laughing maniacally; for a minute it's not far-off to think 50 has, in fact, gone bat-crazy, aiming groin-level at kids who aren't even trying to pitch on his same baseball diamond. (The ill-advised ""Gatman and Robbin'"" doesn't help; it imagines 50 and Eminem as impenetrable badass-scrappers but goofs more like an animated comedy skit for ""Saturday Night Live"".) As if to temper ""Piggy""'s mouthy smack-starting, he slips into his easy Casanova on tracks like the Jamie Foxx-assisted ""Build You Up"" and ""So Amazing""; as many reviewers and 50 himself will tell you, a good majority of The Massacre is ""for the ladies"" (and they are, if you're a lady who enjoys being ordered into cars or spoon-fed pretend-niceties in order to get in your pants). Starting with ""Ski Mask Way"", though, the tide shifts. Ghettotech impresario Disco D's production kicks off a three-track oasis of dynamic soul samples and moody rhythm in a tumultuous sea of gunshot-echoing beats; 50's tone softens for a cluster of phenomenal introspective tracks, like the unexpectedly sweet ""God Gave Me Style"" and ""A Baltimore Love Thing"". On the excellent, muted ""Ryder Music"", he's rapping about himself, as ever, but his tone is intimate and, for once, the man sounds vulnerable. In the final verse, he says, ""In '99 I had a vision and made a decision/ Being broke is against my religion/ Now I picked up/ What?"" Defiant, 50 found his win, and damned if he's giving it up-- but that he's got an Achilles Heel and willing to show it means he's more powerful than we can even fathom. There's your superhero track.","It's been a hell of a week for Curtis Jackson: He dropped The Game from G-Unit, was involved in a shooting outside Hot 97, continued verbally sparring with Nas, Jadakiss, Ja Rule, and Fat Joe-- and even found time to release his second album.

So when branching from Deerhoof, whose music's predicated on spontaneity, brevity, and ""elements"" of songs rather than complete compositions, how stripped down could a side project get? Try 23 songs in less than 35 minutes, the duration of the Curtains' third LP, Vehicles of Travel. In that time, the band-- which features Deerhoof's Chris Cohen and Greg Saunier along with Open City drummer Andrew Maxwell-- manages to cram a bevy of melodies, drum beats, and sound effects into the album, sacrificing form and repetition for musical exploration. For obvious reasons, the songs seldom qualify as ""memorable,"" excepting a few where Maxwell loans his vocals. The entire album feels like the gradual metamorphosis of one giant song rather than a collage of one to two minute tracks. A cherubic mood permeates throughout, as though the band unassembled a child's music box to piece it back together with guitars and synthesizers. ""April Galleons"" and ""Fletcher's Favorite"" come the closest to clean, reconstructed products, drawing inspiration from ""The Rainbow Connection"" and ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"". However, bizarre lyrics deny the album a total PBS feel, like on ""Personal Resources"": ""On top of the Seneca/ The mayor's wife told the senator/ The Fuhrer and me met secretly, yesterday."" Despite these eccentricities, there's a nostalgic quality to the songs, although for what time remains unclear. Although the majority of the album harkens back to 60s television themes, bits of 70s kraut and 80s pop intermittently emerge as well. ""Pagoda Defenders"" and ""Nite Crew"" resemble synth-rockers like Falco and Duran Duran while ""The Gadabouts"" and ""The Bronx Zoobreak"" employ unconventional percussion and horn arrangements reminiscent of Neu! or Can. For what it's worth, the ""idea"" density on this record is very high. Unfortunately, the songwriting lacks the spunk and creativity necessary to trick listeners into believing these 90-second snippets are fully completed songs-- a skill Deerhoof has perfected. Hard as you may try, it's nearly impossible to perceive the Curtains as something more than a sole, albeit critical, cog removed from a larger, better-oiled machine.","Side project from two members of Deerhoof and Open City drummer Andrew Maxwell packs 23 songs into 35 minutes.

Heaven and Hell EP,Minus Story,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46369fc7814a47cd88a/1:1/w_160/d8cddb3b.gif,2005-03-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5589-heaven-and-hell-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"In 2004, Minus Story released their Jagjaguwar debut The Captain Is Dead, Long Live the Drum Corpse Dance, an underrated, impressively expansionist take on disheveled lo-fi psych-pop that hinted they might follow groups like the Microphones or the Decemberists by taking rewarding off-road journeys. On their follow-up EP Heaven and Hell, however, the Lawrence, Kan.-based group have instead chosen to draw their fence-posts nearer to home, corralling their unruly sound into something considerably more tamable. And though this should come as happy news to fans of Bright-Eyed Midwestern sincerity, it might also disappoint those on the lookout for further high plains adventure. Containing five tracks (plus one odd little spoken word ghost story), Heaven and Hell finds the band cutting back significantly on much of The Captain's more atypical instrumentation, though it still makes judicious use of the occasional accordion or toy piano. This relatively unadorned approach places increased emphasis on the group's songwriting, as well as on Jordan Geiger's earnest, reedy vocals. Thankfully, all hands are steady enough to bear up under the scrutiny and Minus Story manage to avoid any true calamity, although moments do arise when you may find yourself longing for the introduction of a stray sousaphone or two. On songs like ""Suffer by Yourself"", with its cheerfully Dylanesque (e.g. sloppy) blats of harmonica, or the dusty highway lament ""Misery is a Ship"", which benefits from a brief cameo of spaghetti-western cavalry bugle, Minus Story can fleetingly recall the cracked Americana of outfits like Giant Sand or Calexico, whereas ""Time Wastes Itself"" and the title track investigate some of the same downcast bedroom atmospheres well-cornered by Smog. Heaven and Hell also includes a serene, plaintive cover of the Misfits' ""Hybrid Moments"", transforming the raucous punk of the original into a chiming (and actually quite lovely) folkish delicacy that would probably make Glenn Danzig want to crush a light bulb with his teeth. Lyrically, *Heaven and Hell makes it sound as though Geiger's been having a rough go of late, with recurrent themes of heartache (and its accompanying sleep disorders) threading through each of these songs. This periodically leads the listener into overly familiar tear-soaked sleeve territory (""*Heaven and Hell is in your mouth/ Because it's not me you're talking about"") but at other points, particularly on the forlorn ""Misery Is a Ship,"" Geiger's brittle, clear-eyed words (""Time makes dogs of men...and marries us to death and buries us with our mistakes"") are coupled so flawlessly with the music's woozy lurch that it creates the momentary belief that perhaps Minus Story do indeed know where they're heading after all.","Jagjaguwar band follows its impressive The Captain Is Dead... with a slighty more trad effort.

Miniatures,Alog,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1af13d19756521386b5/1:1/w_160/fb166b08.jpg,2005-03-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/461-miniatures/,Rune Grammofon,"At this late hour, when the clichés of music software have been completely internalized and we're satisfied with marginally fresh reconfigurations of the past, it's an accomplishment to make a record and have your audience wonder exactly what's happening and how it was put together. Norwegians Dag-Are Haugan and Espen Sommer Eide, who record together as Alog, create abstract but accessible instrumental music that neatly stitches sounds birthed inside a computer with live instruments and field recordings. Alog doesn't sound like a band, exactly, but it also feels some ways removed from the bedroom laptop. They seem to be thriving on the spaces that exist between. On 2001's Duck Rabbit, Alog folded in more beats and experimented with the repetition of techno, but on Miniatures-- their third record on Rune Grammofon-- the duo back once again explores the emotional implications of pure sound. We hear guitars, cut-up synths, indeterminate drones, drum machines, and voices probably captured in a marketplace in their native Tromsø (home of Biosphere, Röyksopp, etc.), but the tracks resist dissection, existing instead as complex interdependent fabric. Opener ""Severe Punishment and Lasting Bliss"", which also led off Runeology 2, one of Rune Grammofon's label compilations, now stands in my mind as a stone drone classic. The structure of the track is highly dramatic; it slowly morphs from tinny guitar distortion into the towering wall of sound of Fennesz' dreams before finishing in a lengthy swirl of dissonant strings. Highly original and utterly transfixing from the first listen, ""Severe Punishment and Lasting Bliss"" is a bold statement of intent that the rest of Miniatures lives up to. Quieter tracks such as ""Steady Jogging of the Heart"" draw power from small details, judiciously applying the techniques of laptop glitch to a carefully assembled library of sounds. The timbre of the organ chords of ""Steady Jogging of the Heart"" conveys easy warmth, while the unsteady pulse imparted by choppy editing suggest an undercurrent of anxiety. ""Leyden Jar"" digs inside the dirty cracks of music production to find the buried noises, smearing beeps, clicks and percussive scrapes between the speakers in an unpredictable pattern. When more conventional instrumentation is pushed to the fore, we get tracks like ""St. Paul Sessions II"", which combines the machine-steady pulse of a single acoustic guitar chord with clouds of vibraphone. Here Alog take the best ideas of Tortoise-style post-rock, strip away the layer of cerebral remove and the focus on instrumental virtuosity, and let the music drift in more emotional (even sentimental) direction. Which seems precisely what's needed. It's exciting to know that the same duo created both ""St. Paul Sessions II"" and ""The Youth of Mysterious Conversations"", which sounds like a highly abstracted cover of Derrick May's ""To Be or Not to Be"". Each Alog track is its own small world with its own internal logic, and Miniatures collects nine good ones without a single dud. An excellent record.","Rune Grammofon duo returns to an exploration of the emotional implications of pure sound.

Paper White EP / Big Black Square EP,Tarentel,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73aea9e61561daa5534/1:1/w_160/e0a93517.gif,2005-03-03 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11848-paper-white-ep-big-black-square-ep/,Temporary Residence,"""Where are those lasers coming from?"" someone asks in the first few seconds. A humidifier drone then bleeds into the studio room with the sounds of rain stumbling off a roof to crack the sidewalk. No need to stare at the lasers, as the sound lowers the eyelid minute by minute-- it's the equivalent of being midway through a 20-hour freeway marathon. Submarine drones and visage-like recordings of footsteps through gravel, a string of duct tape flailing on a fan, and birdsong seep into the mix, further confusing a sense of time and place. By minute 14, tap-dancing rimshots stagger on a trapkit, nearly adding a beat. A dervish-like guitar that disintegrates upon touch hovers in midair, darts about, hides under a table with a whimper, and then shatters a window to flee and evaporate into the heavens. Such immediate images came to mind when I consumed Tarentel's 43-minute sedative, Big Black Square. The music is nothing new from the San Francisco band-- they've long concocted ambient-rock that seems to illustrate smudged and crumpled holograms of sun-dried wilderness. Big saunters time away as the sound titillates anticipation of events that never happen-- a laryngitis-stricken guitar amp does most of the talking. Nonetheless, for Jefre Cantu-Ledesma, Danny Grody, and three comrades this is still some of their most haunting material to date. Big Black Square is a single that the band simultaneously released with Paper White, an EP of leftover minimalist improvisations from the We Move Through Weather sessions. While Big Black seems to soundtrack a fever dream for someone whose worldview is seen through a lifted Venetian blind, Paper is essentially about liberation and the puzzlement of what to do next. Drummer Jim Redd snaps the skeleton together with a rickety groove, while his band mates steadily draw in guitar melodies or long tones that bring pictures into brief focus. Opener ""Isalais Straight"" marches back and forth, back and forth on the tom-toms, while guitar chords are smacked awake. Midway, the song falls to its knees and preys for forgiveness as the guitar drones into listlessness. ""Open Letter to Hummingbirds"" is summed up by its title, in having two guitars dazedly break bread with each other to Redd's steady thud. ""Golden State Overnight"" continues that premise at a faster tempo until the music brilliantly shimmering into the ether; letting a bass clarinet and violin harmonize and then watch a nearby aquarium clean itself (a water spray motor is heard chugging in the back). The title track epitomizes the weariness that came before as a fetal-positioned, acoustic guitar gives way to the returning bass clarinet and violin that deliver long sustained tones for a funeral wake. While there are many blanks that could've been filled in places on Paper White, Tarentel's scope is at its widest and richest in Big Black Square.","Two new EPs from the Bay Area ambient-rock band.

Wind in the Wires,Patrick Wolf,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa9313d1975652139a77/1:1/w_160/26c1d5cb.jpg,2005-03-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8774-wind-in-the-wires/,Tomlab,"In his novel Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer, as well as in numerous short stories, Steven Millhauser has explored the dark gift of genius, particularly in children, and the toll it exacts. His precisely situated historical bildungsromans are rich with period detail and Bunyanesque protagonists who fulfill the wildest promises of their eras, each a larger-than-life manqué whose preternatural abilities (be they in entrepreneurship or the construction of detailed miniature automatons) lead them along the same delirious arc: A meteoric rise to success, a period of virtuosic clarity, and then a flame out as genius shades into unhealthy obsession or is rendered effete by novelty. It's from such embroidered yet prescient pages that young Wolf-- 6'4"", striking, and outlandishly attired-- seems torn wholesale. He began to dabble in recording at age 11, recording violin, junky analog organs, and homemade theremin on his four-track. He joined the art collective Minty at 14 and impressed Fat Cat Records enough that they gave him a computer and mixer to further his explorations. At 16, he left England to form the raucous Mason Crimineaux in France and won over Capitol K, who would release Wolf's solo debut, the bombastic, uncontained electro-folk grab bag Lycanthropy, in 2003. Until Wolf's story has been written in full, it's impossible to say whether his sophomore effort, Wind in the Wires, belongs to the rapid upsurge or the crystallization of vision, but there are signs to indicate the latter. Millhauser's characters' zeniths of achievement are often presaged by their returning changed from a long absence-- some outer expression of a burgeoning darkness within them. After Lycanthropy put him on the radar, Wolf absconded from London to a cliff-side chalet in Cornwall. The formerly blond singer returned with a shock of black hair and Wind in the Wires, which boils off the excesses of his debut and simmers in elegant pools of glitchy beats, found sound collages, crackling electrical sounds, and gothic shadows. Wind in the Wires is like Bright Eyes' Digital Ash in a Digital Urn if Nick Cave had made it, a fertile nexus of tradition, technology, and Wolf's powerful pipes, as he romanticizes travel and escape, pines for lost youth at age 21, dreams of domestic pleasures, and takes potshots at a debased culture. ""The Libertine"" opens the album with clip-clopping hooves, a gypsy-disco beat, sawing violins and a spitting electrical undercurrent as Wolf inveighs against duplicitous priests, immoral heroes and other phonies, while the simpler, poppier ""Land's End"" gripes about the music industry's promotional apparatus. The languidly beautiful ""Teignmouth"" longs for release from banality: Over a staticky pulse and angelic choir, Wolf sings, ""So when the birds fly south/ I'll reach up and hold their tails/ Pull up and out of here/ And bridle the autumn gales."" And on the ukulele madrigal ""The Railway House"", Wolf imagines the placid contentment of growing old: ""So wave goodbye to living alone/ I think we've found our home/ Let's paint these walls and pull up the weeds/ And cast our fevers in stone."" But to focus only on the broader traits is to miss what makes Wind in the Wires so outstanding: Wolf festoons his songs with strange, understated details that ratchet them toward the mysterious. Sputtering electricity, alien frequencies, and sculpted static billow across the record in sparkling clouds. In the midst of the mournful strains of ""Ghost Song"", a perfectly incongruous Bobby Digital-style ""Whoop!"" floats up like a bubble, and the same sound of cycling voltage that opens the first song ends the last one, wrapping the album in a closed circuit. Nothing here has been left to chance. Wolf's strange blend of postmodernism and antiquity is where he seems to break away from being a Millhauser character and gains an affinity with the author himself: Millhauser honors traditional yarning while being fully aware of its archetypal implications; his characters' failures are the waking at the end of the dream or the bleak ending edited out of the fairy tale. For Wolf's sake, one hopes that with Wind in the Wires, he's caught that southbound bird's tail and escaped from Millhauser's inexorable parabola: To be the dreamer of dreams, rather than the dreamt, is clearly his heart's desire.","On Wolf's second album, he romanticizes travel and escape, pines for lost youth at age 21, dreams of domestic pleasures, and takes potshots at a debased culture.

Fighting Style Killer Panda EP,Mommy and Daddy,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5480c2bba1b7de01438/1:1/w_160/b54dc611.jpg,2005-03-02 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5641-fighting-style-killer-panda-ep/,Kanine,"All right, now: Mommy and Daddy are an electro-pop duo! They trade off yelping boy/girl vocals in the style of last week's most cherished new-wave band! They're better than A.R.E. Weapons! They're almost as good as stellastarr*! Their bass lines are fuzzy like adolescents! Their drum machine beats leave you with a smile on your face, which is better than anyplace else, if not then see a doctor-- results may vary! Mommy and Daddy are shouting so loudly because they have nothing worthwhile to say. (Note to pop criticism's reigning PC police: not that there's anything wrong with that, OMG rockism suxxorz, etc.). They're also trying to drown out echoes of past electroclash entanglements, apparently a scarlet letter even in the twosome's own New York City. Yeah, but have you heard the new Fischerspooner album? First up and last up on Mommy and Daddy's latest EP is ""Confection"", chugging Dumpster pop about wanting to take you home, sung by Vivian Sarratt. Then ""uno, dos, tres, cuatro!"" starts track two. Boy, Edmond Hallas must be embarrassed to be less clever than even Bono. After an irritating smoke-detector synth bleep, Hallas shouts something that sounds like ""sodomy,"" but don't get your hopes up-- it's probably not. Of course, that means it's back to Sarratt for track three, ""The Now"", with a desperately heavy bass riff and faux cowbell! After shouting ""confection!"" over and over in her first vocal, here Sarratt cannily mixes it up, shouting ""now!"" instead. On ""Run It Off"", Hallas keeps up his would-be somebody-else yelps over more drum machines and more fuzzy bass lines, dipping to a bellow for the refrain: ""Run it off! Run it off! Run it off! Run it off!"" Needs more faux cowbell. I could describe the remaining track, ""Question Marks Followed by Exclamation Marks,"" but trust me, you've heard it all before. Apparently Mommy and Daddy are big in Britain. (Bad joke: Your mommy would be big anywhere. Haven't seen your daddy, though.) Hopeless Google monkeys have compared Mommy and Daddy's 2003 debut-- favorably!-- to Public Image Ltd. Yeah, we read press releases, too and yeah, Hallas wants to be John Lydon. A better parallel, philosophically if not sonically: nu-garage nadir the Datsuns (hell, even Jet were at least catchy).

What Became of the Likely Lads EP,The Libertines,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfbea9e61561daa75e3/1:1/w_160/93aa9f51.jpg,2005-03-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4772-what-became-of-the-likely-lads-ep/,Rough Trade,"Let's give a hand to John Hassall and Gary Powell, who had two of the most thankless jobs in rock music, yet performed their duties responsibly and reliably. Together they formed the rhythm section of the Libertines-- Hassall on bass and Powell on drums-- but are better known as the two who aren't Carl Barât and Pete Doherty. They don't make tabloid headlines for self-destructive behavior (as Doherty does on a semiregular basis), nor do Hassall and Powell get their pictures on the covers of the band's albums. On the new What Became of the Likely Lads EP-- which will likely serve as the band's swansong-- they appear on the back cover partially obscured by the tracklist, while the singers/guitarists grace the front. There is, arguably, nothing uncommon about this separation of rhythm and melody: Barât and Doherty were, after all, the faces of the Libertines, lifelong friends whose deteriorating comraderie fueled the soap opera that fueled the albums Up the Bracket and The Libertines. But What Became of the Likely Lads-- which gathers two versions of the title track, four live cuts, and the UK single ""Don't Look Back Into the Sun""-- makes it clear that Hassall and Powell actually held the band together, if only musically. On the live tracks, the pair locks into the songs' grooves and keeps them on track, often reining in the guitarists when they stray. ""Skag and Bone Man"" (the B-side to the UK single ""Up the Bracket"") is rough and loose, with Powell breaking into a drum solo as the song falls apart. They do better with the Up the Bracket tracks ""Time for Hero's"" (sic) and ""Boys in the Band"", although they're not too far removed from the originals. But it's the dynamic between the steady rhythm section and the rambunctious guitars and vocals, rather than that between Barât and Doherty, that makes these tracks so tensely compelling. It's like watching a sober guy walk his drunk friend home; just one stumble and they both hit the sidewalk. The drama derives from the band's teetering proximity to chaos, in which lies not rock'n'roll glory but pathetic tragedy, but Hassall and Powell make sure they keep putting one foot in front of the other. That precarious sound translates as naturally to the studio tracks as it does to the live songs, which is to the considerable credit of producer Mick Jones. ""What Became of the Likely Lads"", a remarkable song from the largely unremarkable The Libertines, gets two treatments: the album version and a ""reworked"" version, which aren't different enough from each other to justify the inclusion of both tracks. The album version may ultimately trump the new one, if only for the interplay between Barât and Doherty. The song is about their harried friendship and their complexity of reconciliation, as Doherty is working with Babyshambles and Barât goes solo. For their troubles, Hassall and Powell at least had the best seats in the house.","This now ironically titled EP features two versions of the title track, a quartet of live performances, and the UK single ""Don't Look Back Into the Sun"".

Pink Mountaintops,Pink Mountaintops,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a190ea9e61561daa482a/1:1/w_160/3048d3b1.gif,2005-03-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6566-pink-mountaintops/,Jagjaguwar,"Let's wax reverse chronological: Pink Mountaintops' self-titled debut was issued last year, but the album has been drawing increasingly more attention since the January release of the self-titled debut from the band's evil vinyl-schooled twin, Black Mountain. Besides sharing personnel, the albums have a lot in common. With Vancouver polymath Stephen McBean at the helm, both are notable not merely for their rootsy rock influences, but the specificity of their stylistic appropriations. In a field where bands often consolidate entire decades to achieve a generic ""retro"" sound, McBean's geological formations hew away at something smaller and more ornately detailed. Clearly, this is the way to go. Why settle for a mass-produced replica when you can have the hand-stitched real thing? Of course, no CD comes caked in John Bonham's dried sweat, but then, bands don't stand a chance of becoming deities themselves unless they hone in, internalize their forebears' achievements and conceive something new(ish) from the recycled matter. When it's done well, retro isn't biting; it's a novel and economical use of widely available ingredients. Perhaps Pink Mountaintops haven't been as warmly received as their more ominous-sounding counterparts because their influences are more abstract and toyed-with. On ""Modern Music"", Black Mountain came right out said it-- they ""can't stand all your modern music""-- and proceeded to ride Ozzy's headless bat all up in our grill. Here, McBean and his associates are more reserved. ""Bad Boogie Ballin'"" surpasses the composite weirdness of Black Mountain in its first four bars alone: A grimly metallic beat teams with a gas-huffing accordion to provide a backdrop for McBean's swarthy blues-trimmed vocal. The song seethes with tension, awaiting the melody that never shows up. ""Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy"" is creepy and hollow. Soft solo guitar and meditative female back-up hums nuzzle up to the Doors as McBean delivers a harrowing vocal, revealing his most sexually-frustrated dream-wishes: ""I came all over myself/ Wish I came all over your blouse."" ""I [fuck] Mountains"", despite its titular filthiness, is actually the album's smoothest cut, letting nothing disrupt the flow of its hand drums and wafting-smoke guitars. In general, Pink Mountaintops' music is more provocative when it isn't noisy. Among the louder numbers, only the chipper, almost Kinks-y ""Sweet '69"", which finds McBean's head buried deep in the feathered glory of his Summer of Love fantasies, truly succeeds. Elsewhere, ""Tourist In Your Town"" and ""Atmosphere"" take the Velvet Underground's band-of-gypsies plod into the sunset a little too far, failing to achieve the aimed-for catharsis of ""Heroin"". It's a flawed ending to a promising debut, but I wouldn't call it a letdown: Pink Mountaintops still aren't your dad's rock anachronism, because chances are they know the terrain better than the old man himself.","Before they were Black Mountain, Stephen McBean and crew recorded this LP, which mines similar sounds and themes.

City vs Country EP,Mobius Band,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c361eb335119a49ed6c8/1:1/w_160/b14248ba.jpg,2005-03-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5342-city-vs-country-ep/,Ghostly,"Hailing from the sleepy, made-up sounding Shutesbury, Mass. (population: 1,800), the electro-rock (more like rock-electro) Mobius Band have taken a longish path to Urban Outfitters compilation (don't hate!) buzz band-dom. But the slow build has given the three-piece time to grow into their taught and confident current incarnation. After three self-released, self-recorded, increasingly impressive EPs over the past three years, the band recently signed with those progressive beatheads at Ghostly International and this five-song EP is the first fruit of what seems like a healthy if unlikely partnership. Ditching the meandering instrumental post-rock and country leanings of past releases, the band has morphed into a trim, fleshy rock'n'blip cyborg made up of bass-pumping blood, muscular guitars, and an ever-handy sampler-and-keyboard pacemaker that keeps normal bodily functions running oh-so smoothly. Near-flawless in its execution, City vs Country is at once traditional and progressive, easy to listen to, and dificult to ignore. Not just another group of ax-grinding guys dicking around with annoyingly tacked-on ""electronic elements,"" Mobius Band takes its bleeps seriously and uses them economically and effectively within the intense fabric of their songs. Markedly more precise and three-dimensional than anything they've attempted, the added sonic sheen provided by a professional studio and the mixing talents of Interpol associate Peter Katis fits the band like a snug Powerglove and allows them to indulge in wavy headphone-friendly sonic minutiae. The group shows off its new supped-up sound early with ""Starts Off With a Bang"", which is actually more of a long, winding fuse than an explosion. Chirpy Morse code quickly gives way to group leader Ben Sterling's passive vocals. By now, Sterling has learned how to make his near-monotone drone work within his band's framework as it often adds fragility to the group's airtight arrangements. ""At the start of the century my mind keeps wandering,"" he dreamily sings, succumbing to the futuristic Aphex-on-X bounce surrounding him. ""Multiply"" slowly creeps to its distorted shoegazer crescendo, picking up all passers-by along the way. ""City vs Country"", the most straight-ahead guitar-rocking number, seemingly combines the excitement of new surroundings (two-thirds of the band recently moved to Brooklyn) with the disappointment of an impending break-up through non-linear observations like ""The lights on the train flicker off across your face."" The same contradictory emotions pop up on the last and best track, ""I Had A Good Year"". ""When life is so good it hurts,"" muses Sterling, his somber delivery adding an obvious melancholy undercurrent punctuating the hurt rather than the good. ""I will cut you in half and then we'll see who laughs,"" seethes the singer in a rare moment of lyrical clarity, before ringing guitars and panning keyboards take the track into a supersonic stratosphere. Rumbling underneath, crack drummer Noam Schatz's crunching, processed percussion seamlessly morph into a very earthly pummel by the track's crushing dénouement. On City vs Country, Mobius Band temper the downcast urban hum of studio mates Interpol with a bit of Postal Service machine-bop glee. The newly honed aural slickness only adds to this developing band's potential appeal and instead of getting lost inside a real studio, this rock-electro outfit has found itself-- just in time for their first long-player.","Mobius Band's first Ghostly International EP features five slices of muscular avant-pop.

And Vancouver is kooky as all hell. And L.A. And Brooklyn. Palm Desert got acid rock on lock. And D.C. No? D.C. is fucking Fugazi, man. D.C. is Bad Brains. Dismemberment Plan. Jawbox. Ginuwine. How can a city of Banana Republican pencil-pushers even hope to compete in such a heated psych-rock market? Here's how: There may not be a stranger city on Earth, which is why a band like Dead Meadow existing in the District is not at all surprising. With their fourth album, Feathers, Dead Meadow add another guitarist and venture further outside their 60s influences to create a spacious, hypnotic album that distinguishes them from their stoner- and psych-rock contemporaries. Dead Meadow owes considerable debts to Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Blue Cheer, among others, and the band has always provided a reminder that music like theirs ditched reality in favor of vespertine sances and distorted idylls. Feathers, though, takes those same influences and strains them through shoegaze standards like Ride's Nowhere and the Verve's A Storm in Heaven, augmenting the sludge with gauzy melodies. On previous albums, singer-guitarist Jason Simon seemed to get caught up in his own riffs, a tendency often found in the dubiously conglomerated stoner rock sub-genre. Whether the presence of new guitarist Cory Shane provoked the change or not, Simon is more willing to loose his grip on his guitar, as evidenced on the extended silences on opener ""Let's Jump In"" and the ebb and flow of ""Get Up On Down"". If the riff death grip is what you're into, don't worry. ""Untitled"" is a 13-plus-minute ogre that will stomp the shit out of your crappy computer speakers. Its path is cleared by the curious ""Through The Gates Of The Sleepy Silver Door"", a drum-pummeling of Yoshimi proportions that scrubs any coherent thought you might be having at the time of listening. The other big change on Feathers is Simon's voice. In the past, his nasal whine could grate if it weren't completely drowned out by a slight turn of the volume. ""At Her Open Door"", a slide guitar ramble that leaves plenty of room for Simon's singing, illustrates the subtle alteration. His relaxed delivery is a about an octave lower than normal, and it actually sounds like he's able to force air through his nostrils. ""Stacy's Song"" is an even greater improvement, slapping a bit of echo on Simon's breathy meanderings, which are downright manly. Feathers may not have the heft of Dead Meadow's other albums, but it's easily its most listenable and satisfying from end to end. Along with the mountaintop bellowing of Comets On Fire and the riverside rollicking of Black Mountain, Dead Meadow have established themselves nicely as the bookish Tolkein fellows wandering the forest of the mystical neo-psych hinterland. Look at all that nature! Comets on the mountains, mountains by the river, and meadows in the forest...so pretty. Dead Meadow may not inspire the kids at Ft. Reno like Fugazi. They probably won't keep white folks clutching their spouses like Bad Brains. But I'll be damned if they don't do a fine job of updating the kind of music that made G-Dubs nauseous as a college student, and that's really all you can ask of a band from D.C.","On their fourth album, Feathers, Dead Meadow add another guitarist and venture outside the realm of their 60s influences, creating a spacious, hypnotic record that distinguishes them from their stoner- and psych-rock contemporaries.

Husk,Liz Durrett,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba55e6ef95969322c6c/1:1/w_160/76f98e3e.jpg,2005-03-01 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2599-husk/,Warm,"Most American teenagers armed with pent-up rural angst and a battered guitar proceed to wail, slash, and burn in an effort to quell their broken-locker high school blues. Georgian Liz Durrett was not that kind of teenager. Sounding like a drowsier Chan Marshall, Durrett's quaint, folksy ghost stories seem far more mature than typical young pup fare-- it's difficult to imagine she was around the same age as Avril and Ashlee when she recorded Husk. Then again, most teenagers don't have Vic Chesnutt for a crazy uncle and guiding influence. Produced by the beloved paraplegic southern songwriter, this charmingly backwoods nine-song debut sees the now twentysomething Durrett airing out her spooky mid-90s adolescent material in preparation for an album of more current songs due later this year. Husk is an odd family affair, to say the least. Think Partridge Family but uglier, death-obsessed, and with a sunburnt, junkyard car in place of the fruity schoolbus. Chesnutt, his wife, and Durrett's grandmother all contribute, with Vic steering the album's sparse arrangements and sometimes overbearing funeral-waltz mood. Unfortunately, Durrett's abstract, oddly spiritual lyrical tendencies are a far howl from her uncle's singularly witty narratives. ""There's the ghost of a beast in the woods,"" she sings in a peculiarly calm drawl on the title track, and much of the album features disconnected permutations on such vaguely haunting imagery and little more. The undeveloped facets of Durrett's nascent songwriting skills are often masked by her warm, natural vocals and her uncle's comfy-wooden-chair production but, with too few melodic or lyrical anchors, much of the deathly mystery surrounding Husk quickly evaporates into a hazy, nondescript mist typified by one-word song titles such as ""Slip"", ""Vine"", and ""Net"". Many songs drag and sway without leaving an impression; they fall into some kind of endless folk singer-songwriter purgatory. Even with its nightmarish, echoed-vibrato back-ups, ""Bc"" comes across as a boring, second-rate haunted hay ride. ""Net"" veers dangerously close to Lilith Fair banal acoustic balladry and is barely salvaged by Chesnutt's reliably minimal, resonant recording techniques. It's when Durrett focuses her songwriting that she becomes scarily good, as on the Silence of the Lambs-style murky kidnapping tale ""Captive"". Old-tyme record player pops add to the harrowing theatrics as the deceptively placid singer emotes from a rusty, dripping basement, ""I sit in this corner with my hands bound and my eyes closed."" The juxtaposition of Durrett's assured delivery and the song's prickly subject matter sends uncanny chills. As an introduction to a young talent, Husk shows promise but this early-years compilation doesn't quite hold together as an album on its own.

Born to Be a Motorcycle,Bunky,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47613d1975652138cf5/1:1/w_160/ef8b17c1.jpg,2005-03-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1144-born-to-be-a-motorcycle/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Sufjan Stevens once said of pop music, ""I don't think we're pushing ourselves enough."" Of course, that was before UK six-piece The Go! Team stretched and smooshed up the pop song like so much Silly Putty for last year's Thunder, Lightning, Strike. Recent Stevens signees Bunky, with their own Saturday morning trumpets and laughable sobriquet, hopscotch conventions at a nearby playground. When I was a child, I dreamed of being Joe Montana. This San Diego duo strive toward a Vice guestlist of rock ('n') role models: singer/drummer Emily Joyce's sultry vocals croon ""Karen O.""; her ambiguous relationship with singer/guitarist Rafter Roberts is a matching wardrobe shy of the White Stripes; their fuzzy, disjointed song structures were left off the Ark while trading pogs with the Unicorns. ""Funny Like the Moon"" jackhammers absurdist Magnetic Fields-cum-Chet Baker verses with garage-punk choruses, ""Lipstick Life"" sips absinthe in outer space with Air's Moon Safari, and even failure ""Gotta Pee"" manages to juxtapose fidgety indie rock with Wolf Eyes vacuum noise. Such broad ambitions could be a lot to swallow, but Born to Be a Motorcycle is as playful as it is high-reaching. It's ""Cute Not Beautiful"", as the title to a surprisingly touching ballad explains. Amid the lo-fi simian squeaks of avant-garde love song ""Boy/Girl"", Roberts intones, ""Girl, you know you look so pretty in that dinosaur outfit""-- a line the cool kids will soon be dropping on potential amours in place of ""I caught you a delicious bass."" On ""Glass of Water"", basic thirst becomes fodder for a screeching speakeasy sing-a-long. Even the album's most accessible track, sexily swaggering rocker ""Chuy"", keeps its tongue close to its cheek. And, uh, the name's Bunky. (Apparently ""Bunny"" and ""Monkey"" were Joyce and Roberts' pet names for each other. Aww.) Members of other San Diego bands like Castanets, Rockets From the Crypt, Black Heart Procession, and Pinback also lend their support to the recording, but it's not clear they're needed. While Born to Be a Motorcycle falls just short of the masterpiece the group's core twosome likely intended, it pushes pop's boundaries enough to hope Bunky might slip its surly bonds by their sophomore outing. ""The future's now,"" Joyce demands on burly opener ""Baba"", ""so when the hell's the future?""","Off-kilter, lo-fi indie pop from Sufjan Stevens' Asthmatic Kitty label.

Stick Music,Clogs,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a725b1335d7bf1698fb8/1:1/w_160/eaba4e84.gif,2005-03-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1789-stick-music/,Brassland,"A percussion instrument is one sounded by striking or shaking. This definition covers the usual suspects-- drums, maracas, washboards, xylophones. If you're willing, this also qualifies instruments that aren't considered percussive-- the guitar, the piano, even the violin. With that more expansive characterization in mind, Clogs call their latest album Stick Music. The only instruments used in performing these nine tracks are ostensibly ones that need to be struck in order to make sound, whether the sticks be wood or strung with catgut or even just triangular pieces of plastic. Opener ""Ananda Lahari"" is a traditional Indian hymn, performed here by Padma Newsome, Clogs' primary songwriter. He plays the violin the way one would expect, alternating between legato (connected and smooth) and vibrato (tremulous and pulsating) phrasings to beautiful effect. On other tracks, he and his fellow players (including bandmate Bryce Dessner on guitar, and renowned improvisational cellist Erik Friedlander) take to whacking or plucking or violently bowing their instruments. In ""Pencil Stick"", eerie tinny tones are tapped out while violins are sawed through. This concussive approach is more pronounced on ""Sticks and Nails"", where resonant metallic pings and tongs sound off like broken grandfather clock chimes. And, appropriately, in ""Beating Stick"", the music consists entirely of the players tapping on strings. In case you're unsure, Clogs don't often utilize singers or lyrics. Stick Music's only vocals are on ""Lady Go"", with Newsome utilizing a well-mannered falsetto against a mournful string section for this brief European folk aside. The rest of the album lets the instruments speak for themselves, whether they chatter and buzz like swarming insects (in ""River Stick""), gently keen and wail (in ""My Mister 'Never Ending Bliss'""), or drunkenly swoon (as on the album's final track, ""Pitasi""). Calling this stuff ""classical"" might work as a quick-and-dirty pigeon hole, but it short shrifts the talents of a group that takes its inspiration and cues from indigenous musics all across Europe and Asia. When trying to describe Clogs' music to other folks, it might be better to forgo any genre distinctions and head straight for the thesaurus so you can find fresh and exciting ways to say ""sublime.""","These neo-classical Books associates only use instruments that need to be struck in order to make sound.

Doppelleben,Justus Köhncke,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3313d197565213b275/1:1/w_160/bd3fd79a.gif,2005-03-01 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4577-doppelleben/,Kompakt,"This is getting a bit ridiculous, isn't it, all these 8s? The Pitchfork brass is currently engaged in a bit of half-serious handwringing behind the scenes: we seem to love every other record these days, just keep that in mind. But they know there's nothing we can do; we're only as cynical as the music we're given, and two months worth of gems probably means karmic retribution in the form of a pitiful summer or a Unicorns reunion or a Robert Pollard anthology or something. In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with a bit of prolonged enthusiasm, even if it has the unfortunate side-effect of effing with the wheat to chaff ratio. I was thinking the other day that between Run the Road, M.I.A., LCD Soundsystem, Mu, Fischerspooner, Antony and the Johnsons, Bloc Party, Out Hud, and a handful of other records I am forgetting or have yet to discover, you could make a very good case for the first quarter of 2005 being as strong as the entirety of 2004 for full-lengths. (Singles is another, much sadder story altogether.) Anyway, I'll confess, I'm a Kompakt head, but since I've never really cared much for Justus Köhncke's poppier, vocal-based stuff, I wasn't expecting to like this much at all. But then again, given that there's barely been a disappointing record released this year (Daft Punk get off on a technicality 'cause Human After All hasn't actually been released yet), I shouldn't be surprised that I do. So, yeah, this is good, too: Life is but a stage and we are all but French figure skating judges or Leonard Maltins, or something. So in record-review parlance, this is what you'd call a ""grower,"" which admittedly is another way of saying that if I hadn't been too lazy to get up and change the disc at a certain point, I'd probably still be in favor of keeping Köhncke on a strict diet of house numbers. His second full-length for Kompakt and his third overall, Doppelleben (German for ""double life,"" see) runs the gamut between dancefloor crowd-pleasers like ""Timecode"" (which is included here, albeit egregiously, in a single edit that runs at half the length of the original) and drippy, lovelorn pop like ""Wo Bist Du?"" Köhncke has lots of fun in the space between those two poles. You can tell that he went into Doppelleben without any real mandate because each track just sort of floats from one convention to the next, but rather than sounding like a disparate batch of songs, the end result is like a love note to his favorite music from the past 20 years. Even as it bounces from the clanging industrial of ""Loreley"" to the faithful rendition of Carly Simon's ""Coming Around Again"" (""Alles Nochmal""), it's held together by Köhncke's lush, full-bodied production style, which is as distinctive and as well-articulated as that of any Kompakt artist. Fittingly, the best two tracks here prove Köhncke to be as adept at the vocal-pop stuff as he is at the Kompakt nerd stuff. With its tick-tock opening and slow-timed releases, the eight-minute long ""Elan"" (a condensed version of which also opens the album) is his obvious attempt to follow up ""Timecode"", and although it doesn't have the same spastic little builds, it's almost as good. Elsewhere, the campy vocoded lead and piercing string stabs of the future-disco confection ""Schwabylon"" sound like Köhncke trying to approximate Daft Punk, which is doubly useful now that Daft Punk no longer wish to approximate Daft Punk. But dammit, I'm buzz harshing a little bit there, aren't I? Human After All isn't released for a couple of weeks-- let's enjoy this incredible little run while we can.","This diverse producer's third album overall and second on Kompakt runs the gamut between dancefloor crowd-pleasers and drippy, lovelorn pop.

Italo DeRuggiero / Italo DeRuggiero Parte Due,Alec DeRuggiero,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba2c0084474cd0c28d8/1:1/w_160/68f561e3.gif,2005-03-01 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11725-italo-deruggieroitalo-deruggiero-parte-due/,self-released,"Killer gold italo's going Frisco 1859-- bust.

Seriously, give Geist a (platinum) medal-- can't imagine whose slits he scoured for last year's perfect altalo masterpiece. Turns out Geist's chum Alec DeRuggiero, who does booking for NYC's APT, didn't do so bad for himself either. Selflessly mixed, his Italo DeRuggiero discs came in and out and in last year, drawing from that same way-left-of-center region of italo that Geist did for Unclassics. Perhaps that's less a preference than a matter of fact after the glut of ""definitive"" italo comps in the late 90s-- the Geistgeist of our times? (No more handclaps, please, thank you.) The first disc is more cool than camp-- in this world that's sometimes a bad thing. While the grouchette vox on Special Ed-sampled Belle Epoque's ""Miss Broadway"", the six-o-clock news piano bounce on Kasso's ""Walkman"", the condom-free fuckfest that is Discotheque's ""Disco Special"" (also on Unclassics, yes) and Lily Ann's ditzy soft dentals on ""I'm Going Crazy"" count among the best italo I've heard period, some of Alec D's misfit toys just don't want to be loved, and instead wallow in some serious Where Were You Twenty Years Ago. But it's like what the fuck, you're Answering Service's ""Call Me Mr. Telephone""! Don't give me that shit! The backhalf of this mix has a lot of pride for sure-- a nice reminder that most italo is total fucking garbage. Advanced calculus, economics, and you know, common sense say that the tracklisting for Italo DeRuggiero Parte Due should be spottier than the first one. Sorta the case here, but also sorta not the case. Parte Due lacks the first disc's highs, but doesn't suffer from the first disc's lows either. It's like the first disc's B-side-- trackier, dubbier, sillier, way way nerdier. For some reason each track chugs harder and better than the one before it, a tall claim to make when Stopp's cult classic ""I'm Hungry"" (""Hey! It's fun! You gotta cook a meal for everyone!) has the six spot. But check it: Down to the song's title, Mike Mareen's ""Don't Leave Me Now"" rivals this new Out Hud With Vocals! thing everyone's all excited about, Pineapples' dub of ""Come On Closer"" actually jacks, and Cellophane's ""Music Colours (Part 3)"" is New Order but totally gay. I'd come out and say nothing's gonna top gay New Order, but Trophy's ""Slow Flight"" does, so I'll get back in my hat.","Two mixes of italo-disco unclassics from the music director at New York's APT club.

"Sincerely, Black Lipstick",Black Lipstick,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2eb9d034d5c69bf2cdf/1:1/w_160/e06c8c93.jpg,2005-02-28 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/770-sincerely-black-lipstick/,Peek-A-Boo,"Black Lipstick don't just nod to their influences, they bow. White Light/White Heat is an obvious inspiration for the shambling drums and gritty, basic blues riffs on Sincerely, Black Lipstick, but there's also a hint of peak-era Rolling Stones. On opening track ""B.O.B F.O.S.S.E."", clean lead guitar melodies overlap with crunchy rhythm chords; it's both a throbbing blues vamp and an astonishing imitation of the Stones' tense pop classics. The trouble is, while the Velvet Underground were living their socially irresponsible lyrics-- and the Stones were at least convincing people they were-- Black Lipstick have a long way to go in the believability department. Much of this falls on vocalist Philip Neimeyer, who's doesn't have much range but compensates with clever lyrics and interplay between other vocalists, such as drummer Elizabeth Nottingham. His self-consciously decadent lyrics sound appropriate when sung in a Lou Reed monotone, but he has a hard time belting it out. ""Over the nation/ All the haters/ Bow to thee"" sung in a resigned mumble sounds about right, but underlining lines from ""B.O.B.F.O.S.S.E."" like ""If the world's a stage/ Then the whole damn world should bow to us"" with gusto is something Neimeyer can't pull off. Maybe because the band sounds so impossibly bored, melancholy suits it better than boastfulness. When things slow down, as they do on ""Grandma Airplane"", Black Lipstick manage to sounds even more lethargic than the Strokes; right down to the octave guitar solo, that band is a better reference point than Television or VU. ""Throw Some Money at it"" is a minor-key mid-tempo rocker that, like nearly every track here, ends in a Sonic Youth-esque breakdown of interweaving guitars and steady rhythm. These shifts in structure are proof that Black Lipstick have records at home dating past 1970, and their indie rock touch distances them from formulaic hero-worship. It sounds most captivating on ""Throw Some Money"", twisting and repeating its simple theme to a gradual crescendo. ""Viva Max"" and ""..."" are other somber highlights that navigate the line between disaffected and bored like expert cartographers. Black Lipstick's brand of revivalism is an oddity: Their sound is blatantly derivative, yet they sound the least excited to be playing in that style. Of the bands compared to the Velvet Underground, success often lies in the ability to seem energetic and enthusiastic about the rampant pillaging of the past. Black Lipstick have gone the complete opposite route, which is either really clever, or a complete cop out.","Black Lipstick ape VU and the Stones, but don't sound so thrilled about it.

But in a way they were never really gone, as they've filled the space in between records as a unit with side projects and collaborations too numerous to detail here, though the best of them-- DOME and Colin Newman's solo work-- have more than held their own in the shadow of the Wire mothership. And Newman's on-the-side vitality hasn't dimmed a bit (though he seems to be running out of good names for his projects-- how awful is Githead?), as this latest EP amply proves. Newman is only the biggest name in the Githead liners-- the band is actually a partnership with Robin Rimbaud, aka Scanner, and Newman's wife Malka Spigel, late of Minimal Compact. Rimbaud features in the unexpected role of guitarist, though he and Newman hardly play anything like a traditional riff. Instead, they fill these songs with watery textural washes reminiscent of Vini Reilly and pointilistic, Belew/Fripp-ish interplay. Spigel's bass thumps and bounces, giving Newman's detached vocal leads a funky underpinning and helping to humanize the rhythms provided by something called the Beat Monster. For his part, on the mic Newman balls his emotions up tightly and shoves them down into his shoe, intoning blankly with loosely connected phrases that conjure fleeting images of clinical death and, um...creativity? The lyrics he's whispering or trading off with his bandmates (each gets at least a couple of verses) are largely incidental, though they fit well within the hospital-clean confines of the music, where any emotional leakage comes out in the guitars and the beats are all sharp and to the point. It's actually not difficult to imagine A Bell Is a Cup-era Wire coming up with something like this, though Spigel's deft funkiness-- especially on ""Profile""-- helps set the two sounds apart some. As such, it's the kind of side record that normal Wire fans are likely to find interesting, and it's even a project I wouldn't mind hearing a full-length album from, if the participants are so inclined.","Wire's Colin Newman here enlists help from Scanner and Malka Spigel, late of Minimal Compact.

Life & Love in Sparrow's Meadow,The Skygreen Leopards,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66fea9e61561daa537b/1:1/w_160/4c74e41f.jpg,2005-02-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7760-life-love-in-sparrows-meadow/,Jagjaguwar,"When the Skygreen Leopards played La Nortena in Brooklyn this past Halloween, their rapturous vocal interplay and loping instrumentation turned a clammy taco/burrito establishment into a dense forest teeming with overgrown flora and fauna. Partially obscured behind a pile of amps and other equipment, Jewelled Antler kingpin Glenn Donaldson and Donovan Quinn, aka Verdure, gently explored the sunny Kenneth Patchen territory nurtured on last year's One Thousand Bird Ceremony. It was an understated and shadowy but assured performance. The duo mines a similar dominion on Life & Love in Sparrow's Meadow and the headier, already sold-out companion 12"", Child God in the Garden of Idols. Adorned in Donaldson's lovely surrealist collages, Life & Love's moss-covered reel-to-reel rollicks and shakes, mixing a seemingly endless supply of instruments (jaw harp, 12-string guitar, dulcimer, flutes, banjo, jingle bells, harmonica, etc.), field recordings, chirpy pine needle melodies, and lyrics involving Egyptian birds, waterside tents, patchwork dream languages, orange blooms on fire, ballrooms of glitter and tambourines, hinterland holy places, Blakean mythologies, and other strange/beautiful things. On the jubilant ""Minotaur (Burn a Candle for Love)"", Donovan sings of a shepherd who ""Wishes he was a prairie bird/ But instead he's a butcher's son/ Dreaming of painted, panther-eyed girls"" until Donaldson issues an ecstatic boy-flutes-can-rock bridge. But whatever the subject, Donaldson's aromatic, pristine falsetto aims for the upper branches and baby-faced Quinn's breathier scratch drifts through the sage-drenched undergrowth, telling tales of girls who take their names from saints. Musically, the pop psychedlia is finely tuned. Jaunty opener ""Mother The Sun Makes Me Cry"" ushers in an assortment of archetypal sunny Skygreen Leopards sing-a-longs, but the standouts here are the four downtrodden pieces, especially ""The Supplication of Fireflies"" and ""A Child Adrift"". On the former, an ocarina dances with a ringing guitar behind Quinn's libretto (""Fireflies rejoice/ Fireflies send their sparks across the skies/ Heavy words fly up like ashes/ They scatter into lightness/ The blackened walls tumble/ The fireflies dance"") and a harmonizing chorus. The track ends with a nighttime snippet of what sounds like a frog pond-- croaks, chirps, waterlogged crickets. ""A Child Adrift"" is Donaldson's time to shine. He leads a lovely attack with echoing Wordsworth vocalizations that coast over Quinn's sighs, and a lonesome guitar accompanied by tambourine and the faraway echoes of a ""bleeding whippoorwill guitar."" These junkshop questing, alchemical high naturalists don't offer much variation in their album-to-album approach, but the gentle insistence on a singular aesthetic lends an aura of a protracted ceremony. And though recorded humbly in a trailer on a horse ranch, the difference between this and past Leopards works is a slightly sharper recording quality-- though, fortunately, background hiss/upfront breaths remains-- as well less time given over to unadulterated field recordings, airy instrumental passages, and doses of Thuja/Blithe Sons-style agrarian drone. While Life & Love is tighter than previous albums, the tumbledown song-by-song feel is anything but constrained. No matter how often you spy these Californian versifiers darning their grassy knoll, there's a sense of rambling, ad hoc discovery in each new layer, fallen leaf, and jubilant pigment, as the two construct a decaying tree-fort of silver threads and the most beautiful baubles. Forget the band's patron poetic saint Kenneth Patchen: This is the music Keats and Shelley could be making if they were astute finger pickers who possessed an intimate knowledge of the west-coast landscape, blissful psychedelia, and a skyborn Ziploc bag of Coleridge's Edenic opiates.","On their latest LP, this duo plays with field recordings, a seemingly endless supply of instruments, Blakean mythologies, and other strange/beautiful things.

Known for the innovative sets at the Brooklyn-based Rub parties, The Remix carries all the energy and creativity for BK crowds itchin' to scuff up their dancing shoes. The collection capitalizes on two elements: originality and flow.

Nick Catchdub's cross between middle school favorite ""Cannonball"" and ""Party & Fire-Shit"" combines a fiery Rah ""Ima beat that bitch with a bat"" Digga with Lollapalooza. (For all you Phillyheads, it's like Y100 shaking hands with Power 99.) Of course not every single was ever meant for cross-breeding. The Beatles' ""And I Love Her"" and Kelis' ""Milkshake"" is an unholy alliance of a shameful degree. Gregory Isaacs over ""Go DJ"" is wholly cacophonous. And Mark Ronson rides the gimmick pony with ""Bombs Over Baghdad"" and ""Take Me Out"". C'mon duke, I know there's at least one other record in the crate. And, of course, conceptually this doesn't clear any new ground other than offering a new platform for some rising deejays. Nonetheless, The Remix is honest and creative.

Some Cities,Doves,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba049d034d5c69bf5368/1:1/w_160/a1e1a3d5.jpg,2005-02-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2432-some-cities/,Capitol,"Doves' frontman Jimi Goodwin can't sing. His voice, often derided for its slovenliness and liberality with pitch, lends the Manchester trio's songs a coarseness for which they're left to compensate, or not, with more adventurous instrumentals. The band's previous albums, Lost Souls and The Last Broadcast, generally managed to cover the difference, but at times sounded like Doves were trying too hard to be something they're not: Both albums featured their share of anthemic hooks, but it seemed as if the band were struggling to turn in something as aseptically beatific-- and as popular-- as fellow Brit-rock bands such as Coldplay and Travis. In the three years since Last Broadcast, Doves have cultivated a better understanding of their strengths and limitations, and Some Cities beams with a revivified looseness. Like its predecessors, the album arrives just in time for Spring and comes bearing more than a few certifiable vernal jams. Last Broadcast's ""There Goes the Fear"", one of the bouncin-est seven-minute verse/chorus/verse brit-rock epics with a jungle-percussive outro Radio 1 has ever spun, finds its match in ""Black and White Town"", this album's lead single, which channels Joe Jackson's ""Steppin' Out"" with a plump four-on-the-floor beat and steady-struttin' piano line. But as tender and prissy as they can be, strands of angst and pessimism course through Doves' music, and Some Cities hones this aesthetic push-and-pull, featuring some of the band's darkest and prettiest music to date. Furthermore, those two stylistic extremes aren't always mutually exclusive. The record's first four tracks are downright impregnable. Opener ""Some Cities"" is urgent and yearning. The song is surprisingly tactful in forging a composite order, wedding Bruce Springsteen's arena boot-stomp to the Velvet Underground's driveling, soot-caked guitar yowls. ""Almost Forgot Myself"" is more classic Motown than its rippling atmospherics and surf-echo guitar let on, laying down a rubbery bass line and sturdy boom-chick drumming. It's difficult to tell if ""Snowden""'s deeply cooed, wordless chorus is the work of voice or oscillated guitar or both, but it's sure as hell beautiful. Rounding out the chart-eyeing material is ""One of These Days"", which pegs the platinum-selling populism that has eluded the band. The guitar melody is Some Cities' most chipper, but the song is beefy with details-- a tangential doppler-synth intro and a tasteful effects-laden trim, among them. Again, the drum/bass interplay suggests a Motown affinity-- a dauntingly generic yet fickle ingredient that Doves incorporate pleasantly and organically. It's frustrating when an album feels like it consciously has to embark on some kind of journey-- for instance, the descent from energetic, single-worthy material to slow introspective ballads that's so often just a cover for frontloading. Some Cities traces a similar arc, but Doves aren't pulling the wool over our eyes; the album's second half is nearly as well-executed as its first, if lacking the same galvanizing momentum. ""Shadows of Salford"" is a muffled, herb-slowed piano dirge that sends Magical Mystery Tour its regards. From there, the album acquiesces, staking one last bopper (""Sky Starts Falling"") before bowing out gracefully with the huge, sweeping ""Ambition"", a dignified snares-off dirge. Like many great brit-rock records, Some Cities is plucky and resilient-- it wants badly to show you its hurt but wouldn't dare spill its guts straight; that would be impudent. Doves know better: They hold their breath to the end, until, wheezing and transparent, their hearts shine clear.","Third studio album from the ambitious brit-rock band is more of the same: big choruses, slightly off-kilter sonics, and gruff vocals.

Heart Like a River,Ida,by: Stephen M.

Ida's spare, mostly acoustic songs move with the slow yet ineluctable flow of a river; there are no rapids and few eddies, just the steady motion of currents and occasional crosscurrents. The band members are slow moving as well: this is their first album since 2000's Will You Find Me (and its same-session partner The Braille Night), which seemed to portend something like a career. After five years and countless solo and side projects, the band has reconvened as a trio: Daniel Littleton, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Karla Schickele. Heart Like a River features numerous guests-- including Cecilia Littleton, original member Rick Lassiter, Jean Cook, and Dominique Davison-- but these three form the core, and their voices combine as elegantly and dreamily as ever. ""I'm so lucky to be here/ Just to have you near,"" Littleton sings on ""599"", a sentiment clearly addressed to his bandmates. Heart Like a River wastes no time picking up more or less where Will You Find Me and The Braille Night left off. ""Laurel Blues"" wakes up with a gently plucked guitar and Mitchell's caress of a voice, eventually joined by Littleton and Schickele. There's a squall of guitar feedback, but nothing breaks the shimmering surface. While they feature piano, strings, drums, and even a little radio static, these eleven songs that follow rarely stray from this acoustic folk template, even as they set Ida's gentle eddies against a musical geometry of shoegazer spirals and lines of droning feedback. These songs are, unsurprisingly, understated in the vein of Low or Mojave 3, but their quietness too often works against them: The lull of the music occasionally dampers the melodies and mutes the songs' immediacy, rendering them politely unobtrusive and undemanding. Likewise, the songwriting possesses a hushed timidity that can be intriguing, matched as it is to the evocation of people who are mere observers in their own lives. In ""The Details"", Mitchell sings, ""You could just take my hand/ You could stand up for me,"" leaving it to the song's subject to take action. But this passive-aggressive tendency becomes frustrating as the lyrics begin to sound apologetic, as on Schickele's ""What Else Could I Do"". In a descending melody reminiscent of Aimee Mann, she sings, ""If this is your idea of love/ What else could I do?"" even though the point is that she is doing absolutely nothing and doing it very patiently. What could have been a kaleidoscope of conflicting emotions-- anger, dread, self-loathing-- instead settles for a monochrome of resignation. If Ida's sound is like a river, the emotions the band conveys are simply stagnant.","Spare, mostly acoustic emo-pop band's first offering since 2000's Will You Find Me and its same-session partner The Braille Night.

The Mother of Love Emulates the Shapes of Cynthia,The Prayers and Tears of Arthur Digby Sellers,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18e5e6ef959693201ea/1:1/w_160/85453233.gif,2005-02-27 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6564-the-mother-of-love-emulates-the-shapes-of-cynthia/,Bu Hanan,"The Prayers and Tears of Arthur Digby Sellers is frequently compared to Bright Eyes, which is understandable. Besides the indie-folk bent and ostentatious titles, the primary affinity is logistical-- both groups are actually solo singer/songwriters supported by a revolving cast of musician friends. Succinctly put, Conor Oberst is to Bright Eyes as Perry Wright is to Prayers and Tears. Like Pedro the Lion or Sufjan Stevens, Wright's music has a solemn, prayerful aura and an oblique religious bent. On Mother of Love, he's surrounded himself with friends from bands like Sixpence None the Richer, the Polyphonic Spree, and Ester Drang to flesh out his meticulously sculpted ephemera, a haunting synthesis of folk, rock, country, and electro. ""Concerning Lessons Learned from the Aliens"" shuffles through various permutations of drifting acoustic arpeggios and chimes, ballasted by an elementary chord progression and a vocal turn reminiscent of Grandaddy's simplistic, easygoing sonority and Oberst's sustained metaphorical thrust sans melodrama or self-pity. Wright's skillful arrangements are a large part of the record's appeal, and here the various melodic snippets come together with a winsome string section for muted closing climax. By the time the husky, intense inflections and folk-rock exclamations of ""Cannot Eat Better Not Sleep"" roll around, it's hard not to imagine that Wright is the sort of restrained, concise singer that Oberst might one day grow into. Wright wrings a lot of mileage out of songs that move in incremental dynamic shifts between whispery bedroom music and crashing electro-rock pile drivers-- the mordant hush and theatrical stomp of ""The Eventual Intimate of So Much Nostalgia (Hutchinson Effect)"", the distended piano and dark dirge of ""Above the Waves (Pluripotency)"", and the languid, demented choral inflections of ""The Slow Decay of Some Radio Afterglows"" all adhere to this template. Others don't: ""Rotation of Crops"" and ""Archaeopteryx"" are laden with staticky, off-kilter beats and ominous drones. ""Ammunition for a Bolt-Action Heart"" is driven by sharp pokes of bass and sleek rhythm guitars punctured by drum machine salvos; the pronounced loud/soft dynamic and direct lyrics mark it as the album's only unabashed rocker. The record revolves around the theme of lost love, but Wright sets up a series of imbricate, evocative images that submerge us in the feelings while sparing us the pathos. Every time I say I never want to hear another concept record about somebody's failed marriage, one comes along that's lovely enough to make me to eat crow. But I swear to God, this is the last one. Now will someone pass me a steak knife? This crow is fucking tough.","Prayers and Tears... drafts friends from the Polyphonic Spree to create this synthesis of folk, rock, and electro.

Jeff Hanson,Jeff Hanson,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0545e6ef95969323530/1:1/w_160/c3af1695.jpg,2005-02-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3733-jeff-hanson/,Kill Rock Stars,"There's no sense in burying the lead: This is Jeff Hanson's second solo album for Kill Rock Stars and, yes, he still sounds like a woman; often uncannily so. Which is not to say that Hanson's a fey moonchild in the style of a Marc Bolan or Devendra Banhart, nor does he channel the powerhouse androgyny of Boy George or Antony and the Johnsons. Nevertheless, when his voice first emerges nearly a minute into the ravishing slow-burn of the opening ""Losing a Year"", its tone is breathy and angelic enough to make Art Garfunkel sound like Bon Scott, and so startlingly feminine that you might jump to verify that you haven't cued up a lost Cat Power record by mistake. Once the initial shock of his vocal timbre subsides, however, Hanson's meditative arrangements and skillful pop craftsmanship come to the fore, and underpin the album with artful, dazzling folk-rock that recalls the heady, early-70s L.A. orchestrations of Joni Mitchell or Judee Sill. Expanding ambitiously on the expressive sincerity of his 2003 solo debut Son, Hanson has here decked his songs out in full chamber-pop regalia. With assistance from co-producer and arranger A.J. Mogis-- who has previously lent his various talents to such acts as Bright Eyes, Rilo Kiley, and the Faint-- most of the tracks on Jeff Hanson veritably drip with vibrant layers of piano, violin, accordion, and cello, giving the album a sumptuous breadth of detail. The most obvious recent touchstone is Elliott Smith's XO, but throughout the album Hanson displays the exquisite patience and subtlety to allow his songs to blossom gradually which, coupled with his extraordinary voice, should help establish him wholly as an artist of distinction. Built on a base of fiercely strummed acoustic guitar, the aforementioned ""Losing a Year"" climbs methodically over the course of nearly eight minutes before cresting in a spirited full-group swell, while tracks like ""Welcome Here"" and ""Long Overdue"" are constructed around lush, two-fisted piano chords that carry the snap and jangle of vintage AM gold. Hanson showcases some deft folk picking on quieter cuts like ""Now We Know"" or ""Let You Out"" that, though they wouldn't have sounded out of place on Son, still possess an animated Rubber Soul appeal. And on ""This Time It Will"" he even takes a pass at sprightly alt-country, its breezy twang clipping along briskly like a colt out for its morning run. As with his previous work, seemingly every song here sets about the gentle archeology of brushing the sand from past relationships to re-examine every minute detail, with each track addressed to some nameless ""you."" At times this can give Jeff Hanson a certain uncomfortable sense of personal invasion, but perhaps this feeling is just a natural effect of Hanson's entrancing voice, an otherworldly instrument likely able to make nearly anything sound as intimate as a lover's whisper.","Second solo LP from this Kill Rock Stars singer/songwriter.

From Here to Eternity,Giorgio Moroder,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c545c0084474cd0c36ee/1:1/w_160/1364c003.jpg,2005-02-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5639-from-here-to-eternity/,CasablancaCasablanca,"I didn't grow up with disco. Like a lot of kids, it was one of things kept hidden from me by my parents, along with my dad's Playboys and the truth about unicorns. And just as I proudly tried to convince my kindergarten colleagues about the existence of strange, horned horses, a significant part of my life has been under the impression that music made specifically for dancing was inherently crappy. Laugh now, but there are still many who believe this. My mother, for one-- of course, she also tends to say things like, ""the 70s were the worst decade ever."" She grew up in a different era, with different values, but she isn't the only one. We all know people who still shudder at the mention of disco (or prog or jazz or new age or any other suspiciously, popularly maligned genre of music), and for the most part, we give them their space. After all, different strokes, right? My mother's contempt for disco has mostly to do with the fact that it (just like the decade of the 70s in general) usurped her generation's idea of ""fun,"" transforming her into an outsider almost overnight. Sixties kids thought that having fun meant getting together with people you loved, listening to music that meant something to everyone there and looking forward to a world where a peaceful, open-minded community would have their day. To them, disco was just another reminder that materialism and obsession with self would never really go away, that their dreams weren't necessarily the way the rest of the world thought about things (even though, ironically, polyester-donned boomers were hugely responsible for disco's mainstream success). However, I think this is different for today's kids. We grew up hearing about how bad disco was, but because we weren't actually there to decide for ourselves, most of the wisdom is second-hand. Thus, claims like ""they don't even write their own songs"" or ""it's fake music,"" which were arguably valid prejudices (misguided though they sound to me) for a generation hopeful that peace, love, and understanding were universal values, mean something slightly different for us. When I say that uber-producer Giorgio Moroder was the first person to produce an entirely digital LP, it doesn't necessarily mean that his music was ""fake""-- in fact, if anything, in light of most of what we listen to, it's a feather in his cap. Today's ""rockists"" (which is really just a fancy distinction for people who hold onto any particular set of values re: music at the expense of everything else) don't generally bring up truly interesting dichotomies of community versus self or majority versus minority. To them, music has a more abstract relationship to identity, one obscured by inherited judgments and not as easily penetrated. Moroder is an interesting case because he sidesteps most ""disco sucks"" arguments due to the fact that he did write his own stuff, did produce it, and even went to so far as to design much of his studio. Like Kraftwerk, he had long been interested in the possibilities of electronic music in pop, and with partner Pete Bellotte, used his background in pop songwriting and arranging to forge one of the most successful production partnerships of the 70s. At their Musicland studios in Munich, Germany, the pair made their greatest claim to fame making records for Donna Summer, though Moroder also worked with Sparks, Blondie, and Japan, among dozens of others. His method, though behind-the-scenes as were most of the great disco producers, was hardly ""fake"" or dismissive of the history of recorded pop up until then; rather, like ABBA, Lee Perry, or the aforementioned Kraftwerk, he used available technology and his own ingenuity to make music as suited to its era (and beyond) as any artist could. From Here to Eternity was Moroder's third solo LP (after 1972's underrated, if redundantly titled Son of My Father, and 1976's Knights in White Satin), and is a marvel for disco historians, and a perfect nugget of dance music for anyone else. Its opening sidelong mix predates house by almost a decade, yet would (and did) fit perfectly in the set of DJ aiming to keep people happy via Euro-centric electro beats and angelic vocoder-ized choruses. And that's the trick: there really aren't any choruses (or verses for that matter) on the first side of this record, it's a constantly evolving, perpetually changing suite of music-- which begs the question, ""is this pop?"" Maybe not. Or, maybe it's just one of the first visions of what pop would become for a generation of listeners who didn't necessarily need messages or refrains or catchy hooks to have fun. Of course, given that the album opens with such a lengthy mix of music, you're better off diving in with the intention of getting lost for a while. The title track and its reprise mix now-classic Euro-house 4/4 pump (via digital kick-drum, I might add) with Moroder's distinctive, double-tracked tenor and a backing chorus of disembodied sopranos. Disembodiment was probably one of the reasons disco was supposed to suck for my parents, yet in the context of a decade when the boundless optimism and idealism of the 60s seemed suddenly, woefully inadequate, it-- along with punk's related undercurrent of disillusion-- was perfect. It was more than perfect; it was danceable! ""Faster than the Speed of Love"" brings the mood down from the opening track, segueing into the minimalist, ominous ""Los Angeles"", using a simple synth motif and striking harmony vocals to impart its momentum. ""Utopia-- Me Giorgio"" is more lush, with a percolating bass line and long, wistful backing vocals. The second half of From Here to Eternity loses some of the charge, if only due to its comparatively conventional, disconnected structure. Still, the dark vocoder intro and rising intensity of soprano harmonies during the chorus of ""I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone"" is a interestingly compact specimen of Moroder's way with a pop song, and only suffers when you compare it to his work with Summer from the same period. I don't believe there's much point in doing that though, and if the ""disco sucks"" brigade taught me anything, it's that using pre-formed biases and ideals to judge this music usually misses the point. Different strokes and our own ideals, right? Sounds good to me.","Hip-O-Select reissues the famed Munich producer's most complete solo effort-- one of the greatest LPs of the disco era.

Frances the Mute,The Mars Volta,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3bbeb335119a49ed7a2/1:1/w_160/eb2eb060.jpg,2005-02-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5118-frances-the-mute/,Interscope,"Indie and prog-rock have a lot more in common than most of their listeners might like to admit. Both are dominated by apostate wallflowers who act a lot cooler and more self-assured than they really are, and their artists, despite creating an aura of aloofness, are notoriously defensive. If you wanna take the psychoanalytic bent, both have masculinity issues: Prog compensates with double kick drums and the phallic gratification of rabid shrrredding, while indie prefers to spin its shortcomings into anti-heroism. This is not to detract from the legacy of either music-- both have rich and diverse histories-- but the reps of each have been tarnished by generations of feckless dudes whose spotlight-hogging has rendered the genres unusually susceptible to generalizations. In fact, the terms themselves are generalizations, almost always used negatively: These days, bands are most commonly dubbed ""prog"" or ""indie"" when their music isn't provocative enough to earn a more individually tailored description. On De-Loused in the Comatorium, the Mars Volta weren't straddling any fencelines. Rather than carrying over characteristics from the rough-edged indie-esque stylings of their former band, At the Drive-In, or plunging headfirst into the never-ending math equations of psilocybic canterbury prog, they artfully missed both marks: too sincere for indie but not quite prolix enough for prog; too melody-driven for prog but not repetitive enough for indie. Listeners' initial bemusement enabled the band to transcend genre reducibility, which won De-Loused quick (if hesitant) points from critics and fans. But two years later, there are few other recent records for which putatively in-the-know listeners are so cautious of voicing approval. If you liked De-Loused (or thought so, at least) but often found yourself biting your tongue in the company of others, you were probably in the majority. The Mars Volta drew attention for its technical proficiency, but behind all the meter-changes and 32nd-note polyrhythms, De-Loused featured some very strong melodies. The album's best moments registered in part because of the galling pomposity with which they were delivered, but the tripartite solos and Cedric Bixler Zavala's ornate vocal wallpaper wouldn't have held up without a backbone. The band managed to ingratiate themselves with so many who would have otherwise relegated De-Loused to the realm of ironic pleasures because they had the tact and melodic good sense to make masturbation acceptable for a deceptively Victorian set of listeners. Of course, there was always the kid with the green Ibanez who didn't know better and staged impromptu Omar Rodriguez-Lopez deification rituals. With no apologies, Frances the Mute-- The Mars Volta's new 77-minute, five-track, gratuitously subdivided, and feebly narrated album-- is for him. Call it what you will, but be sure to have finished your homework before tackling this gnarled swamp thing. I'm reluctant to say Bixler-Zavala and Rodriguez-Lopez have become better musicians in the two years since De-Loused was released. Any possible strides in technical proficiency are showcased in brazenly flown-from-the-rafters pandering. But the Mars Volta are also a band in the truest, bluest sense of the word, and their strong unity actually manages to temper songs that are premised on lack of temperance. Solos are kept to a minimum; the band chug full-throttle on the same set of tires. Their most sophisticated algorithms are contained within sturdy sonic superstructures. In this sense, they're more Mastodon than King Crimson-- only they kick about a third as much ass as a Dream Theater side project. Predictably monolithic and impossibly huge, Frances never stops chugging. Its five songs are divvied up in several, nearly indistinguishable movements, but the album moves wholly, as a gross, plodding, overstuffed mass. Opener ""Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus""-- which is said to tell the story of an HIV-positive male prostitute and drug addict born out of rape, but who knows?-- builds to a powerful, string-driven climax at around the eight-minute mark but never bothers to come back down, staying aloft in a spiral of guitar arpeggios and overeager drumming before eventually devolving into a chorus of synth textures. At six minutes, ""Widow""-- a yowling ""November Rain""-style ballad-- is half the length as the next shortest track, and still at least two minutes too long. It, too, subdues into a wash of chattering electronics, as if an envoy to the next, equally inconsequential track. Despite its long-windedness, Frances the Mute doesn't require a long attention span: It's as mesmeric as it is mercurial. Like an effective pop novelist, the Mars Volta manage to convey vast amounts of information in easily digestible fashion without saying much at all. Zone out to the closing 30-minute ""Cassandra Gemini"" for proof: Even at this length, the track seems brief, sailing by in stupefyingly uneventful fashion. What may at first seem like extraordinary, ceaseless fluidity gradually sublimates into wah-wah wish-wash. Smoke a bowl first if you need to, but nothing short of opium will convince me that there aren't more productive ways to spend 30 minutes trying to fell a redwood with a plastic spoon than listening to this beast. At least some things haven't changed. For instance, Frances largely retains the audacity of De-Loused's lyrics. ""Cassandra Gemini"" approaches storytelling with the same breed of macabre circumlocution that pocked the band's debut. (A grizzled, possibly vocoded voice delivers this bracing narrative: ""There was a frail syrup dripping off his lap-danced lapel, punctuated by her decrepit prowl/ She washed down the hatching, gizzard soft as a mane of needles."") But no matter what your feelings for De-Loused, at least the band had a mind to curtail their most capricious jams before they lost all context. Here, they seem hellbent on making an album that's as contiguous as possible, and the result is a homogeneous shitheap of stream-of-consciousness turgidity.",,2.0,
Talk Amongst the Trees,Eluvium,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc59eb335119a49ecc41/1:1/w_160/8d80868e.jpg,2005-02-25 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2765-talk-amongst-the-trees/,Temporary Residence,"Drone music directs a listener's attention to texture. Once you know you're getting long tones and gradual changes, you focus on the sort of details. The timbre is what provides the mood, and is what separates the Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid from the very, very awake sounds of Aube. The best stuff finds that crucial edge between ""too pretty"" and ""too noisy"" and rides it like a water-skier pushed along by the lip of the boat's wake. Matthew Cooper's Eluvium project has on occasion found this edge. I'm thinking in particular of the 15-minute ""Zerthis Was a Shivering Human Image""-- the closing track on his debut LP, Lambent Material-- which throbs with damaged energy even as a layer of drone buried deep in the center hints at a ultimate serenity. Perhaps thinking that he'd said his piece with the held tones, the next Eluvium album, An Accidental Memory in the Case of Death was a collection of short piano pieces. Heard by some as kin to the impressionistic minimalism of Harold Budd, An Accidental Memory strikes me as a riff on some of the dramatic cues from the soundtrack to On Golden Pond. Nice enough, I suppose, but insubstantial. With Talk Amongst the Trees, Eluvium returns to drone with a renewed sense of purpose. While there's nothing here anywhere near the intensity of ""Zerthis"", the album provides enough tension and variety to keep things interesting. The exquisite 10-minute opener ""New Animals from the Air""-- with its billowy mass of backward guitar seeded with overdriven guitar patterns-- is the sort of thick sonic blanket which Windy & Carl used to tuck us under. In a similar vein, ""Calm of the Light Cloud"" delivers on the promise of its title, filling available space with layers glowing harmonics. Throughout Talk Amongst the Trees, Cooper has it down when he aims for immersive warmth. Slightly darker tracks such as the quiet ""Show Us Our Homes"", which has two separate metallic seesaw patterns swaying lazily and falling out of sync, and ""Everything to Come"", with its anxious, distorted whine, retain a sense of relaxed contemplation. As with Eluvium's debut, this album's peak comes on an extended centerpiece. This time the boost isn't provided by a threat of noise, but by a sense of cinematic grandeur. The 17-minute ""Taken"" is built from a series of strummed guitar chords that seem to be continually climbing upward on an Escher staircase. As it marches along ""Taken"" becomes almost heroic, even after you realize that it actually changes little with each passing minute. It's a big effect on an album consisting mostly of smaller, quieter ones. But still, it holds together. That prickliness that pushes my favorite drone tracks over the top is lacking, but it's clear that Cooper had other ideas that happened to turn out quite well. ","Temporary Residence's resident ambient artist patiently works with narcotic drones and slowly unfolding chord changes.

But his insights are filtered through a very personal perspective and come out his mouth as lyrics that are skewed, surreal, and often humorous. On Clem Snide's fifth album, End of Love, he sings about the nature of love and the mysterious doings of God. On the title track, love becomes just another hipster trend, a comparison that gives Barzalay the opportunity to scold a fickle trend-follower (""You're the first to know when a movement's come and gone"") and observe that ""no one will survive the End of Love."" On ""Jews for Jesus Blues"", he peruses the promises of Christianity and realizes ""now that I'm saved I miss being lost."" And he tries to answer the age-old question, Why do bad things happen to good people?, on ""God Answers Back"", and comes up with something much better than, say, ""God Shuffled His Feet"": ""Your blood will color every sunset/ Your tears will help Me grow some trees."" These are big big issues (are there any bigger?), inspired by the deaths of his mother and his mother-in-law. But Barzalay works better with small moments, things that everyone experiences but few actually take time to consider. Through these instances (as on ""Joan Jett of Arc"" from The Ghost of Fashion and ""Made for TV Movie"" from End of Love) he catches brief glimpses of life and death but only hints at their dwarfing magnitude. When he faces them head-on, they ironically become smaller in scale-- less daunting and therefore less affecting. So End of Love isn't Barzalay's best collection of songs, and the production tends to gloss over the instruments so songs like ""Collapse"" and ""When We Become"" sound subdued and blandly unobtrusive. Still, the album has some unaffected gems, including closer ""Weird"", which sounds like it was recorded during a party and effortlessly pops the bubbles of the self-proclaimed oddballs who ""aren't as weird as you'd like me to think."" Best of all is the quiet ""Made for TV Movie"", in which a Lucille Ball biopic inspired a Tolstoyian revelation: ""They would never make a movie if everything was great/ Because happiness is boring."" What makes ""Made for TV Movie"" so sublime (in the sense of both overwhelming and mortally terrifying) isn't the playful songwriting, but the sound. An unidentified young girl, no more than four or five, sings on the bridge, a couple of measures of wordless la la las. But she's utterly charming, not only in her innocently arhythmic delivery but in the reaction she solicits from Barzalay. He turns his attention from the microphone to the child, and the world closes in around them. It's maybe the most intimate moment captured on a Clem Snide album-- completely unrehearsed, unaffected, and endearing.","Eef Barzelay produces his group's latest SpinART LP-- the band's fifth overall.

It seems every hotshot Hollywood sci-fi writer prophesizes this. And, hey, after scientists recently unveiled robots capable of walking on varying terrain, I was a tad spooked. So how dangerous are machines in music? Are IDM sweethearts like the Postal Service and the Notwist in fact mankind's first casualties in this apocalyptic war? Okay, let's not kid ourselves, the stakes in music aren't that high. Yet, throughout One Ten Hundred Thousand Million, the second full-length from Austin instrumental trio the Octopus Project, the ongoing tension between acoustic and electronic instruments is pervasive. Guitars strain to be heard over effects-laden keyboards, basslines desperately pulse before chunky synth-lines supplant them, and at the center of this struggle is percussionist Tito Miranda. Miranda plays the Dr. Octopus-- hee-hee-- to these unruly machines, simultaneously providing the songs with a strong rhythmic backbone while trying to maintain control of the music's electronic parts. Rather than using a drum machine, the band frequently opts to let Miranda pound away, even on the album's most rhythmically furious numbers. Opener ""Exit Counselor"" is a cyborg of a song composed of Miranda's measly human arms flailing to keep pace with bionic, stop-start synth blasts. Even when backing a guitar riff on ""Six Feet Up"", Miranda busts out thirty-second note fills, and even quicker crashes, relentlessly. As a result, these up-tempo rockers exude a plethora of energy, albeit with a fatiguing amount of fury. Fortunately, most of the tracks don't inflict this level of strain on the listener. ""Responsible Stu"" and ""Malaria Codes"" are therapeutic laptop pop ballads amidst the industrial clangor of the album. The former especially soothes with a dulcet keyboard line so tender it almost breathes above an electronic beat as harmless as a crinkling candy wrapper. The true highlights, though, occur in the band's most balanced numbers. ""Tuxedo Hat"" bobs on a bassline innocent enough to be from a Mega Man stage while a modulated keyboard and fuzzed up guitar somehow harmonize with each other. With its atmospheric and strangely sad reverb-guitar/synthesizer interplay, ""The Adjustor"", the prize track here, showcases the ultimate potential of this electronic/acoustic union. Each instrument shares at least a piece of the simple melody before willingly handing it off to the next, and Miranda doesn't have to fracture his wrists to provide the rhythm.

"Government Commissions: BBC Sessions, 1996-2003",Mogwai,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38113d197565213bd4a/1:1/w_160/3741da41.jpg,2005-02-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5370-government-commissions-bbc-sessions-1996-2003/,Matador,"My favorite Mogwai memory dates back several years, when I had just gotten to know the band via their inestimable first full-length Young Team. I was poking around in Boston's Newbury Comics, as I often did in college, and that album was playing on the store sound system. When it came to ""Like Herod"" I positioned myself in a corner so I could watch everyone in the entire store jump about three feet in the air when the song made its abrupt shift from meditative quiescence to ear-splitting guitar squall, and I have to admit I jumped a bit myself-- even though I knew it was coming. At their best, Mogwai are a band with the power to move people-- emotionally as well as viscerally-- and Mogwai did both on that album, triggering a crushing avalanche of praise they've been trying to dig out from ever since. The end result of all that praise was that the band couldn't stay the same without being called one-trick ponies and couldn't move on without being labeled charlatans, but they moved on anyway and survived the feeding frenzy, not to mention plenty of critical indifference. None of their subsequent albums have been as good as Young Team, but each has held its own, and Government Commissions-- a cleverly-named new career-spanning compilation of BBC sessions mostly curated by the late John Peel-- makes this case better than perhaps the albums themselves. Revolving around a crushing, intensely visceral 18-minute performance of ""Like Herod"" that blows the already amazing original album version to kingdom come, the non-chronological tracklist emphasizes the consistency of the band's output and gives Mogwai a chance to show that the quality of later tracks like Come on Die Young's ""Cody"" or Rock Action's ""Secret Pint"" compare favorably to earlier, more widely acclaimed songs like Young Team's ""R U Still In 2 It"" and the 4 Satin EP's ""Superheroes of BMX."" The versions of the songs the band floats through (unlike a lot of post-rock bands, Mogwai don't plod, they float) differ enough from the originals that fans will feel rewarded listening to them, but not so much that the record couldn't serve as a decent introduction to the band. Selections range generously across the group's discography, pulling from each full-length and a few EPs. John Peel's comforting voice (he truly was amazing) introduces Mogwai as the disc kicks off-- the band dedicates the album to him in the liners-- and they shuffle in with a bobbing take on ""Hunted by a Freak"", which also opened their latest studio effort. From there, the album follows a well-sequenced arc that reaches an early peak on ""R U Still In 2 It"", and builds tension again through EP and Come on Die Young material-- including a mellifluous reading of that album's ""Cody"", one of the few vocal tracks present. The whole thing climaxes with ""Like Herod"", and as I said earlier, this version takes the cake and eats it too, rolling through its complex, low-key intro before bursting into a rage. The second burst is even more powerful and they draw it out into a crazed, 10-minute freakout that dumps you nicely into the hovering beauty of ""Secret Pint"". Bottom line is that Mogwai are an insanely powerful live band, and these sharp recordings play like a unified set rather than a scraped-together compendium of disparate sessions. And though it's impossible to call this a proper ""Best of Mogwai"" disc, owing mostly to the absence of a version of ""Mogwai Fear Satan"", it's both a fine introduction to the band and a definite must for any fan, especially anyone who's seen them in person and wanted something that came close to capturing the experience.","This career-spanning collection of BBC sessions works both as a treat for fans and as an appropriate introduction to a band whose studio albums haven't captured the ferocity of its live performances.

How to Make a Monster,The Cramps,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69cea9e61561daa53df/1:1/w_160/b4524a50.jpg,2005-02-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1659-how-to-make-a-monster/,Vengeance,"At least, they're honest: On the back cover of this two-CD retrospective is a small banner that reads: ""Cramps fiends only!"" How To Make a Monster features one disc of demos and one of early live performances. The demos are lo-fi recordings of their first songs, recorded with a revolving cast of musicians around vocalist Lux Interior and guitarist Poison Ivy Rorschach. Only diehard fans will want crude recordings of already-crude Cramps originals and covers-- not many people need four versions of ""Rumble Blues"". These early recordings are a blueprint for the Cramps' sound, but Interior is a long way from finding his manic persona, sounding detached and mumbly through many of them. The liner notes-- written by Lux and Ivy themselves-- are full of record-geek comparisons like ""Carl Perkins meets the Shadows of Knight"" or ""Link Wray meets Dwight Pullens."" The booklet essay describes trips to various records stores as much as the actual recording process. That's appropriate for a band who purposefully inspired punk's embrace of rockabilly-- their amalgamation of 1950s pop culture and obscure vintage rock was the careful and calculated construct of two crate-digging scenesters. The second disc, comprised of two live sets-- one each from 1977 and 1978-- is more worthwhile, although there's a world of difference between the two shows. The first is the group's third-ever performance, a set at Max's Kansas City that sees the struggling band playing a handful of tunes to a cold and sometimes heckling audience. The longer second set, recorded at CBGB in '78, is a huge leap in sound quality, in the Cramps' confidence, and in crowd reaction. Lux Interior comes into his own as a frontman here, taunting and baiting the audience between songs, who respond with near-unbelievable squealing throughout opener ""The Way I Walk"" and songs like ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf "" and ""Love Me"" (which sunk like a cannonball in water in the earlier set). In one short year, the band apparently got a grip on their distinctive mix of garage rock, rockabilly, and crude humor-- and crowds were apparently taking notice.","This two-disc retrospective is one half demos, one half live performances.

The Cosmic Game,Thievery Corporation,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7795e6ef95969320fb3/1:1/w_160/c23d10b1.jpg,2005-02-23 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8006-the-cosmic-game/,Eighteenth Street Lounge,"Marking an invigorating return to form for the Thievery Corporation production team of Rob Garza and Eric Hilton, The Cosmic Game assembles a stellar cast of guest vocalists and collaborators to help the duo craft their most focused and captivating work to date. And though the Thievery Corp.'s trademark confluence of chilled trip-hop, time-stretched dub, and casual musical globetrotting initially appears as tranquil as ever, beneath this false serenity churns an undercurrent of political anger, disillusionment and alienation that helps charge the album with enhanced fervor and vitality. ""Let's start by making it clear who is the enemy here,"" sings the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne, opening the album with ""Marching the Hate Machines (Into the Sun)"" a title that everyone should be able to get behind, regardless of political persuasion. (Unless you're one of those pro-Hate Machine nutcases.) Though Coyne never does actually get around to informing us who the real enemy is, the track is nevertheless an appropriately melted stunner of tripped-out, progressive Dark Side of the Moon dub. Babylon continues to come under fire on tracks like the sternum-rattling throb of ""Warning Shots"" or the driving roots reggae of ""Wires and Watchtowers"", on which the sultry Sista Pat asks, ""How can the wicked smile while the world is burning?"" as acres of humid, Black Ark horns surround her with their insistent reverberations. Perhaps most astonishing of all is Perry Farrell's echo-saturated performance on the turbulent ""Revolution Solution"". Delivering what is almost certainly his most appealing and least mannered (read: irritating) vocal on record, Farrell here shows remarkable restraint, repeating ""I hope for comfort but I never felt too safe"" with a disarmingly genuine sense of vulnerability. Less successful is David Byrne's contribution on ""Heart Is a Lonely Hunter"". Although the track features the bug-eyed paranoid isolation Byrne is famous for (with lines like ""Save bottles of water and flour and sugar/ Turn off the AC and hang up the bedsheets"" nodding politely to the Talking Heads' ""Life During Wartime""), the backing Latin rhythms and shimmer of keys never really congeal into anything memorable. On this track, as well as during such brief instrumental numbers as ""Holographic Universe"", Thievery Corp. fall victim to their lazier, more antiseptic tendencies and their sound drifts dangerously close to the type of innocuous, Latin-whiffed wallpaper that Pottery Barn compiles to sell to your sister. Garza and Hilton thankfully recover quickly, however, and The Cosmic Game's final five tracks constitute a veritable tour-de-force of trance-inducing fusionist bliss, carrying the listener from Jamaica to Rio to India with magic carpet ease before the quiet, hookah-puffing ""A Gentle Dissolve"" ends the game with a sigh rather than a scream.","The downtempo duo's latest features vocal collaborations from David Byrne and Wayne Coyne.

"Alone, Not Alone",Montag,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5360c2bba1b7de0140f/1:1/w_160/dda3fe48.jpg,2005-02-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5625-alone-not-alone/,Carpark,"Montreal composer Antoine Bedard's perfumed, stylishly retro electro-pop is the latest in a lineage that can be traced backwards from contemporaries like M83 and Cyann and Ben, to modern forerunners like Stereolab and Air, to the French pop singers of the '60s. America in the 1960s was clearly not hungry for nuance-- in looking abroad for a musical craze, it wholeheartedly latched on to the pragmatic soulfulness of Brits like the Beatles and the Kinks, but failed to chart the romantic abstraction of French pop stars like Serge Gainsbourg and Francoise Hardy. But in a different, more subtle America, one unsaddled with a desperate need to constantly prove its vitality to itself, a French Invasion might have replaced the British one, a mirror world where mobs of cool, calculating teens calmly adored Belgium's French-speaking Jacques Brel as he disembarked from an ocean liner. Many American listeners are familiar with Gainsbourg, and there's a subtle contradiction you may have noticed in his songs that also typified those of his contemporaries-- they were light, lacy confections, all sweeping acoustic melodies and mannered joie de vivre, but the pristine, precise inflections of the singers also had an aloofness to them, a sense of distance alien to the American preference for ""soulful"" singing. It's no surprise, then, that the advent of digital technology has also seen a rejuvenation of the '60s French pop style: Digitally sampling analog instruments allows composers to capture this dichotomy of warmth and sterility more strikingly than ever before, and the genre is being not so much revisited as transformed. Montag inhabits the aesthetic more fully than many of his counterparts-- M83, for whose albums Montag composed string arrangements, traffics in outsized versions of classic French pop's minimal melodic phrases, but lacks the slightly ironic remove; Air plays up the kitschy qualities; Stereolab emphasizes elegance and detachment but lacks warmth. On Alone, Not Alone, Montag has achieved a cunning equilibrium between distance and immediacy by covering the range between elastic, swooning electro-pop and concise, considered standoffishness. While the latter category is pleasurable-- the digital clockwork of ""Le Temps d'Observer les Voles Ouvertes"" and the chiming serenity of ""Motif"" spring to mind-- it's in the former that Alone, Not Alone really shines. Amy Milan of Stars turns in charming duets on the fluid, clattering ""Angles, Country & Terrain Connu"" and the Stars-style neon orgasm of ""Perfect Vision"", her mobile melodies darting around Bedard's whispery, deadpan baritone. James Cargill of Broadcast lends bass and electronics to ""Figures of a New Color"", a staticky suite of celestial strings and muttering samples. Ariel Eagle weaves her angelic, staccato syllables through twinkling chimes and Bedard's lackadaisical croon on ""Grand Luxe"", and on tracks like ""All I See""-- where Bedard provides the sole vocal presence-- he concocts jazzy chill-out that suits his limited range. Montag pulls off the neat trick of being strikingly modern by way of chicly old-fashioned-- his droll lyrics and gorgeous, slightly icy melodies expand upon the traditions of the '60s French pop icons while honoring them, as he emotes with precision, restraint, and a sardonic eye. Let the French (-Canadian electro-) Invasion commence!","Stylish electro-pop on Carpark from Montreal native and M83 associate Antoine Bedard.

Cut,The Slits,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a09d034d5c69bf35a9/1:1/w_160/3c7435d0.jpg,2005-02-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7803-cut/,IslandIsland,"Here are some things you might already know about Cut, even if you haven't heard one note of the Slits' music: This is the first time the album's been released domestically in the U.S. on CD (with the obligatory bonus tracks). The album cover features three members of the group wearing nothing but mud and loincloths. When the group first formed, they couldn't play their instruments for shit. The songs on the album offer an amalgam of punk's abrasive DIY WTF-ness and the spacious relaxed rhythms of dub reggae. This album is a keystone for any and all punk-based grrrl movements. And-- though it goes without saying, it's often said anyway-- this album is terribly, terribly important in the history of the rock music and the grand scheme of canonical flippity floo flap. Funny thing is, for all its import, Cut is actually a lot of fun. Fun in the way Ari Up trills and coos and yelps across the songs like a precocious schoolgirl taunting all the boys and teachers. Fun in the way Viv Albertine scratches and waxes her guitar. Fun in the way Tessa's bass and Budgie's drums slip in and out of grooves like lovers test-driving the Kama Sutra. Fun in the way the group turns every subject it touches into a giddy playground sing-a-long, whether it be a diatribe against pre-set gender roles (""Typical Girls""), a story about Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten butting heads (""So Tough""), a cautionary tale about PiL's Keith Levene's drug use (""Instant Hit""), or songs tackling other didactic topics like invasive media propaganda, shoplifting and the idealized love of a new purchase. Fun in the way producer Dennis Bovell employees spoons and matchboxes as beat accents (in ""Newtown""), centers the group's meanderings with a little piano or more traditional percussion, and allows the band to occupy both punk and dub at the same time. The Slits don't destroy passerby: They stop them, dance around them, sing songs to and about them, playfully taunt and tease them, and then pass them the dutchie. The bonus tracks are OK add-ons-- the group's version of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" was slated to be the record's first single way back in the day, and would have served fine as another respectfully disrespectful punk cover, but appropriately ended up as the B-side to the actual first single, ""Typical Girls"". ""Liebe and Romanze (Slow Version)"" is an instrumental version of ""Love Und Romance"" bathing in the hot and welcome tropical sun outside of Lee Perry's studio, and serves as a pleasant cool down after the frenetic shenanigans that preceded. But, of course, if you're giving this album a spin, it's for the first 10 tracks, and if you're coming to them for the very first time, then I envy you. Yes, this is an important document, and part of any balanced popular musical diet, but this isn't a multi-vitamin-- this is skipping school as spring turns to summer to spend an extra-long lunch with friends driving to the not-so-local Jamaican bakery for a few beef patties and some much-needed fresh air. Take a long, deep breath, and enjoy the moment while it lasts.","Incredibly, this is the first U.S. CD release of the legendary punk album from Ari Up and company.

Lost Marbles and Exploded Evidence,Enon,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc92ea9e61561daa74de/1:1/w_160/2f908535.gif,2005-02-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2817-lost-marbles-and-exploded-evidence/,Touch and Go,"Can't remember many bands whose B-sides/rarities comp things I liked as much as their full-lengths, but here's one. That's not a backhanded compliment either: High Society is one of the best straight-up indie rock albums of the past decade, and Enon's last one, Hocus Pocus, wasn't nearly as bad or disappointing as everyone made it out to be. ""The Power of Yawning"" and ""Candy"" yucked it up, sure, but John Schmersal and Toko Yasuda really were just starting to write together, and when the two did jive, Enon gave us ""Starcastic"" and ""Disposable Parts""-- as unyuck as songs get. Lost Marbles And Exploded Evidence-- playing off seven-inches entitled ""Evidence"" and ""Marbles Explode"", both included-- collects Enon's non-LP material released on wax, as mag promos, and web exclusives from as early as April 1998, when Enon was just Schmersal, some synths, and a sampler. In fact, the comp covers all four of Enon's line-ups, an understandable red flag for ""inconsistency"" and ""grab-bagginess"" and ""fans only, non-fans!"" as crits who are anxious to pounce on these guys have lazily pointed out. Weeeee. Thing is, guys, the comp's way less about caulking Enon's cracks and way more about jocking Schmersal. He deserves the love, frankly. He's one of indie rock's most consistently compelling songwriters; this comp shows Schmersal can also take the band in more experimental directions, indulging his whims but only for our pleasure. Drum machine/gristly saxophone face-off ""Genie's Got Her Bag"" throbs like a jazz-funk great; crooked lullabies ""Blow Infinite Ways"", ""Making Merry! Merry!"", and ""Fly South"" posterkid DIY lo-fi way better than that Ariel Pink guy; ""Party Favor"" wants to be Odelay, and to the song's credit, it pretty much is. So that's the experimental stuff. As for the rest of Lost Marbles, Enon stumble a bit on schmaltzy Toko triphoppers ""Drowning Appointments"" and ""Evidence"", and lap-pop number ""Kanon"" is just OK. Most other songs are rockers though, on par with the band's best moments on High Society and Hocus Pocus. Schmersal and Yasuda meet halfway on opener ""Knock That Door"", a sunnier, sillier ""In This City"". ""Marbles Explode"", released in 2001 but recorded two years before that, remains my favorite Enon song, though. It has plenty of vocoder and herk-and-jerk and bonsai synth lines, noise that's obedient to song and not vice versa, and my favorite Pygmalionism: ""There's a girl inside my heart that's only four beats old/ I'm facing forward or so I am told/ Now fluxuating with a kiss into another mode/ And now she's dressing up her dolls before the marbles explode."" P.S.: There's a DVD too. P.P.S.: Brainiac!","Lost Marbles And Exploded Evidence-- the title plays off seven-inches entitled ""Evidence"" and ""Marbles Explode"", both of which are included-- collects the best of Enon's non-LP material.

The Article,Eastern Lane,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0013d197565213b44d/1:1/w_160/bce0d993.jpg,2005-02-22 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2919-the-article/,Rough Trade,"Somehow the word ""drunken"" has become a positive modifier for a rock band. Blame it on garage rock revivalists like the Vines or Kings of Leon who've garbled and staggered their way to fame, or music magazines overly eager to publish which drugs Jet or ex-Libertines members take, but one thing's for sure-- sounding wasted is mod. Take The Article's opener ""Daffodils For My Mother"": While someone literally starts eating a daffodil for money, singer Derek Meins giggles idiotically at his own jokes: ""Are daffodils edible?...Does your daffodil taste good? Two bass drums if your daffodil tastes good!"" Then, as instructed, two beats cue the stomping 60-second Toadies-via-Pixies rip-off. Maybe Meins is merely compensating for Eastern Lane's ho-hum Berwick-upon-Tweed roots, but his contrived recklessness isn't working. If you're going to tug at heartstrings on the mushy piano ballad ""I Feel Liberated"", don't expect to pass for Johnny Rotten and not give a fuck on single ""I Said Pig on Friday"", which contains the album's most unapologetically gauche lyrics: ""Love is a glove that does not fit/ The pussy, the folly, the tit."" Come on, how do you not then snicker when the band puts their gear away on ""Goodbye Rose Garden"" and Meins grabs an acoustic to whisper ""I'll be waitin' till the big hand meets the small one/ And I'll be longing on my own/ I'll be waiting 'til the morning brings me 'round."" Between these two extremes, Meins employs an over-the-top blues-punk wail, often clashing with the band's sober, comprehensive playing. In this case ""comprehensive"" means mixing post-punk with anything from Gin Blossoms riffing to Foo Fighters power-pop. The best result of this fusion is ""No. 5"", which grinds on a pretty seven chord before smoothing out into a sunny, delicate chorus where-- shhh!-- Meins finally sings with his ""inside voice."" ""For the Sun"" falls a little short of these expectations, but Meins' fieriness buoys the song despite its sing-along chorus and radio-friendly veneer. Saying Eastern Lane have an identity crisis would be misleading; these guys simply don't know how intoxicated they actually are. What the band assumes is balls-out intensity on The Article is instead a self-conscious impulse to offset innocuous songwriting. You all know the type: The guy at the party wearing a lampshade on his head, screaming drunken obscenities, and chugging Tabasco sauce only to be found 30 minutes later serenading girls with his acoustic and some DMB.","Rough Trade artists embrace rock revival sound, stereotypes.

Helter Stupid,Negativland,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c169fc7814a47cd708/1:1/w_160/3ab8fdb3.jpg,2005-02-22 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5739-helter-stupid/,SSTSST,"""Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die.""
-Mel Brooks Negativland and David Brom's ax murder of the latter's family is an example of Mr. Brooks' argument. Brom's frequent arguments with his piously Catholic parents over what music he was allowed to listen to as a teen possibly led to his deed. After reading about the February 1988 murder that took place in Rochester, Minn., musique concrete-rockers Negativland decided to make the best of their financially doomed and cancelled tour. They submitted a bogus press release that claimed the feds placed the Bay Area band under house arrest until the investigation of the Brom murders begins. Negativland's college radio chart-topper ""Christianity Is Stupid"" possibly caused the fateful argument in the Brom household, the band implied. Once the virus was released, the news media banged on their door-- with the band usually declining to comment and the reporters too lazy to fact check. Whatever band interviews commenced were sexed up and edited to fit the news. Somehow, Negativland's recontextualized sample of Rev. Estus W. Pirkle's sermon where he sarcastically declares, ""Christianity is stew-pid; communism is good!"" was responsible for the ax murder. In short, the media fell into an open sewer. Did Negativland fall in the sewer as well? ""Our act of creating a false association with such a tragedy will remain open to ethical interpretation,"" the band concluded in its liner notes for the 15th anniversary reissue of the Helter Stupid, their document of the Brom case. This reissue now makes the case rather quaint in our time when musicians immediately deny influencing tragedies (i.e. Marilyn Manson and Columbine). Is the band offering the album as a lesson in the mass media's vulnerability to manipulation or are they laughing at the past? It is difficult take Helter's two tracks seriously as one moment finds a Rolling Stone reporter calling to ask a band member (off the record) if subliminal messages are planted in their music-- ""NOW IT BEGINS!"" someone shouts. In the 18-minute title track, the infamous ""Christianity is stew-pid!"" becomes a happenin' break for a disco-schmaltz number that can teach elderly couples the Hustle at the rec center. A deftly edited collage of newsbites and an advertising producer battling with his engineer, saying, ""Doesn't it bother you that evil messages creep into our commercials when you play them backwards?"" then follows. Corpses pulled out of the sewer are the props here. It is difficult to determine if Negativland deserves acclaim for displaying a mirror to the crassness of ratings-driven news or dismissal for enjoying that same decadence. If an artist were to pull the same gimmick today, to the wolves that person goes. Negativland could be rewarded for their bravery,\xCAbut publicity stunts can only go so far. Included with the Helter EP is The Perfect Cut, the band's satire of 70s pop music reduced to disposable commercial dreck. Pastor Dick Vaughn, host of Negativland's long-running ""Over the Edge"" radio show, presents his ""Moribund Sounds of the 70s"" as interjected with sampled audio sales pitches for the most marketable music to reap millions with. The music gets the typical ""Over the Edge"" treatment-- media soundbites all orchestrated like a Carl Stalling Looney Tunes score. The Perfect Cut is more of an amusement than a critique as the loud horn blasts and the irritating choirs attest; yet, the satirical target is peanuts compared to our age where music is only believed to be made popular by what the test marketing and focus group data suggested. A finger cut.","These all-Amerikun satirists revisit a time when inspiring the news media to blame your music on a real-life ax murder was thought to be great art.

"Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives EP",Aesop Rock,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01f13d19756521382e2/1:1/w_160/af7acb79.jpg,2005-02-22 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/67-fast-cars-danger-fire-and-knives-ep/,Definitive Jux,"Watching major labels try to come up with strategies to prevent filthy media whores from leaking promos to rabid fanatics on file-sharing networks is funnier than the grape-stomping news reporter video. Encoded CDs, planted mp3 loops, and early release dates are their security tactics de rigueur, but there is no way to stop me. I just traded the new Beck album for a brick of Afghani hash and a pair of Dunks made of kitten pelts and human skin. A Pegasus and the Ferrari it's hitched to both came courtesy of a really insane Fischerspooner fan in Belgium. If it weren't for file-sharing, I wouldn't have half the Coogi sweaters in my closet or the overwhelming female attention that comes along with them. On the other hand, independent labels play it coy. They don't do much to mask the content or stymie the transfer, instead encouraging purchase with elaborate packaging, enhanced cd's, and various other golden ticket bonuses. With Aesop Rock's latest release, not only is Def Jux offering seven brand new tracks but a limited edition 88-page lyric book spanning Aes' catalog Float to Fast Cars. The book is a downtown Finnegan's Wake translated by Travis Bickle, presenting in black-and-white the emcee's dense urban loquacity, and the EP is a welcome back Jukie party compared to the hermetic epic of his last album. If you're looking at the book as some magic decoder of the Brooklyn wordsmith's lyrical mazes, no such luck. He's saying exactly what you thought he was. From ""Freeze"" off 2003's conceptual Bazooka Tooth: ""The robo-komodo promo Zen patience a-alike to this jittery drooling mess. Bitterly unruly on mud hugger alert, he usher dirt to the kick circus."" Fuck what it means, the transcription alone must have been about as fun as a colonoscopy. Sideshow is proof of Aesop Rock as a verbal collagist, clipping slang and pasting it next to bastardized movie dialogue and sideways references to current affairs. If nothing else, the book illustrates his evolution from abstract storyteller to abstruse social commentator. Throw in some stylized photography and Edwardian clip-art, and you got yourself hip-hop's answer to McSweeney's. Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives furthers the template formulated on Bazooka Tooth. Aesop Rock produces three of the seven himself, longtime collaborator Blockhead handles three, and Rob Sonic cleans up with one. Aesop's takes are the standouts, future blends of Bomb Squad bulk and mid-tempo Eric. B rumble, that complement his cadence and intensity. ""Zodiaccupuncture"" matches funhouse organ with synth/guitar funk while Aes spews staccato indictments against the establishment and manages an Occam's Razor reference that actually makes sense within the context of a bunch of shit that doesn't. Camu Tao and El Producto join in on the one-upsmanship of ""Rickety Rackety"", a Mach-9 valentine to NYC, with each paying paranoid tribute to the Rotten Apple. Following along is exhausting as each emcee rips off speed-freak syllabic riffs on apathy, dishonesty, and escapism. ""Food, Clothes, Medicine"" stomps around like Mecha Sly Stone while Aes spits venom at either the homeless situation, or neglected veterans, or corrupt politicians. I really couldn't tell you which, and the lyric book didn't help much. Blockhead and Rob Sonic's production is not as lively, but both provide enough of their usual sparse future funk to keep it interesting. The instrumental value of Aesop Rock's voice automatically fills any gaps left by a lazy production or rehash of an old idea. A lot of people cried foul after Bazooka Tooth, demanding more Blockhead less Aesop on the boards, but Fast Cars should silence some of that trash talk. Aesop's production here is clearly more confident, able and welcome, possibly indicating that his beatmaking may prove as idiosyncratic as his lyrical style. With the quality and effort put into this release, Def Jux and Aesop Rock have done what every EP should do, provide something of unique value and create anticipation for future releases. Fast Cars is more than filler material between albums, and The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow is a thoughtfully packaged, worthwhile memento for fans. The question is, how much can I get for it on eBay? Jesus pieces don't pay for themselves.","Latest Aesop Rock EP also comes with an 88-page lyric book.

To this day, when I hear ""Jesu,"" it's hard not thinking of those wiry South Jersey NASCAR-o-lytes and their puffy-haired, horribly accented girlfriends, uttering the off-key syllables, trailed by wafts of chaw or chewing gum. Even in the context of stuffy Bach's ""Jesu, The Joy of Man's Desiring"", I immediately think of Sebastian B of Skid Row telling me about his new pyramid scheme, his trick for spotting dear, and his forever-toppling prized stack of ""porns."" In this sense, Jesu-- ex-Godflesh/Napalm Death/Techno Animal maestro Justin K. Broadrick's most recent stab at weighty brooding-- has offered some much needed psychic distance. Though I don't act like it, I want to live to 100, and to do so I likely shouldn't carry around adolescent detritus ad infinitum. Fortunately, Jesu's self-titled debut is such an epic dollop of gloomy molasses abrasions that retools the word so entirely, I can already feel Wilbur, Fuzzy, and the rest of the gang slipping away like so many contestants at the annual greased pig chase. Founded on poky dynamics, densely crunchy instrumentation and often surprising electronic accents and submerged melodies, throughout the record, Broadrick continually exhibits the most disciplined, slowdive patience before implanting a metallic backbone. Jesu's eight tracks sound so uniformly thick-- and issue such an inexorable grind-- that it's easy to slip-slide inside the sludge and drown. Metaphysical volleys aside, the environment sustained is so submerged that its tones become habitual, disappearing into the fabric of the landscape as they continue to ring. Unlike the Heart Ache EP, Broadrick is appropriately backed here by the heavy Codeine beats of Ted Parsons (Prong, Swans, Godflesh), whose slowcore ascension make this record even more gigantic than its predecessor. A stellar opener, the quite moving ""Your Path to Divinity"", gently eviscerates a heavy bass line, spotty drums, and airborne feedback bolts. Vocals materialize four minutes later, with an accompaniment of ringing notes that double the human voice. As with many of the LP's compositions, the drums fall out towards the end, generously leaving room for synth/organ and what sounds like an accordion, though is more likely something electronic. With pieces this long, codas can sprout new beginnings. Here, when the pounding returns-- as if captured with a different, booming microphone-- Broadrick's vocal notes hit a magical sustain. That sedate flowering is quickly replaced with the crunchy Helmet dynamics of ""Friends Are Evil"", a distorted wire feed/assembly line leaking sparks across a concrete floor. Details are increasingly piled upon its solid base until everything blends into a net of ring-tones and locked grooves. These explosive repetitions bring to mind Hydra Head proprietor Aaron Turner's Isis, but the whispered vocal accompaniment and downer vibe are closer in tone to shoegazing. Whatever the touchstones are, Jesu mixes these ingredients into a dozy, dense amalgam. ""Tired Of Me"" should strike a note with those Ride/Venus Bead fans of old: It's a suck-face tune, even if the libretto ends with a murky parade of muddied marching-band drums. ""Walk on Water""-- the most totally protracted piece-- grabs hold of an upfront high hat, pitch-shift vocals, and waves of guitar angularity, and follows their wake for 11-plus minutes. If this all sounds monotonous...well, that's partially the point. But for impatient ears, when it seems a tune might fall into tedium, Broadrick adds a buzzing guitar or shiny keyboard or some other not-so-obvious hook that expands it all over again in a cloudburst. His sense of space and three-dimensionality is at times uncanny. And for those of us who admire the patient beauty of a grimy Luxurious Bags or incandescent Jóhann Jóhansson, there ought to be more than enough intense, flat-lined passages of untouched drone to escape the rushed feeling of a pop beeline. Now if only I could stumble upon some Slint-y dronecore band called ""Youse""...","Jesu, the latest project from former Godflesh/Napalm Death/Techno Animal maestro Justin K. Broadrick, follows the Heart Ache EP with another thick, sludgy mix of metal and slowcore.

Nashville,Josh Rouse,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1359d034d5c69bf28e0/1:1/w_160/179bf5b6.jpg,2005-02-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6843-nashville/,Ryko,"The Nashville of The Nashville Network is no more. Hell, The Nashville Network itself is no more: TNN became Spike, which is good for watching Deep Space Nine reruns while playing hooky in a Dayquil daze but little else. The city of Nashville has long since morphed from countrypolitan to Cosmopolitan, with ritzy suburbs named Brentwood, nightlife beyond the Bluebird Café, and Tim McGraw/Nelly collabs. On each of the three albums since his alt-country debut, Dressed Up Like Nebraska, singer/songwriter Josh Rouse has fashioned urbane light-pop window treatments for yuppie denizens of the new Nashville. His latest is his second titular nod to Music City, USA-- 2000's Home was recorded shortly after Rouse moved there-- and arrives following the itinerant Nebraska native's move to Spain, where fragile Tweedy/Adams vocals are presumably less ubiquitous. Rouse's 2003 soft-rock concept album 1972 bared his Bread fetish; Nashville returns to the 80s pop undercurrents that emerged on his 2002 breakthrough, Under Cold Blue Stars. The album's finest track, ""Winter in the Hamptons"", hews closely to the Smiths classic ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"", placing handclaps and an infectious ""ba ba"" chorus atop chiming acoustic guitars and a bass line that nearly quotes the vocal hook from Edwyn Collins' ""A Girl Like You"". But the most Rouse does lyrically with his urgent-sounding arrangement is: ""Put on your hat, because the forecast is rain clouds."" If there's a single reason Rouse has never broken the David Gray barrier, it's his often-inconsequential observations. Sleepy acoustic closer ""Life"", harmonicas aspiring toward Saint Neil, will erase only the most superficial post-breakup hangovers with ""Just sing a song and let love shine/ 'Cause that's just life."" Try Love's ""Everybody's Got to Live"" instead. As with past Rouse efforts, Nashville is always pleasant, if unexceptional. On pedal steel-drenched opener ""It's the Nighttime"", his awkward school/fool rhyme is only grating upon close listens, and his playful come-on about wanting to ""try on your clothes"" would be kinda cute even in the Bible Belt. While today's best-publicized mtvU acts act like imitating the early '80s is revolutionary, Manilow-tinged ballad ""Middle School Frown"" mentions ""new wavers"" and ""punk rock stars"" in the curmudgeonly context they deserve. With a Pernice Brothers-sharp melody and swooning strings, ""Streetlights"" will please fans of 1972 (the album or the year). ""My Love Has Gone"", which opens ""Side B"", echoes the bitterest Rumours-era Fleetwood Mac. It's all nice, but give me New York or Hotlanta, thanks.","The city of Nashville has morphed from countrypolitan to Cosmopolitan-- so has Josh Rouse.

Unseen Forces,Sagan,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6985e6ef95969320d9f/1:1/w_160/424309a5.gif,2005-02-21 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7798-unseen-forces/,Vague Terrain,"Humor and playfulness are usually in short supply in abstract electronic music. Small-label releases from this world are dominated by techno-fetishists (derived from Autechre, fond of track names like ""Fuut98[c-1]"") and back-to-the-womb pastoralists (from whom you might find a song called ""Glazed Tricycle""). There's not enough irony, laughter, and just plain goofiness. San Francisco's Sagan-- a project combining the sound talents of J. Lesser, Blevin Blechtom, and Wobbly with the visuals of director Ryan Junell-- seems intent on correcting this balance. A deep-70s rusty-hued painting on the inside of the double digipack (audio CD + DVD containing short films and six hours of live shows) sets the tone with Carl Sagan's warm and knowing grin. Popular science and the cosmos are undercurrents throughout Unseen Forces, serving as a conceptual launching pad for a project designed as a unified whole. Track titles like ""18,000 B.C. - Figurines of Vulva and Waterbird"" and ""Rosetta Stoned"" hint at Sagan's fondness for the ridiculous, and the music holds up its thematic end by subliminally referencing early ancient planetarium kitsch and possible musics from beyond the stars. The opening ""Theme from Unseen Forces"" is a retro zero-gravity fanfare with an almost painfully affecting melody-- the sort of thing you could see playing when Leon Theremin ascended into heaven. From there, however, Unseen Forces takes a decidedly abstract turn. As sometimes happens with Blechtom-related projects, Sagan seems intent on creating an entirely new music vocabulary on each track. Most of Unseen Forces is admirably non-referential, layering various muffled drums and alien synths with various squeaks, static washes and machine groans. Though the music is certainly original, much of Unseen Forces is harsh and unpleasant-- loaded down with frequencies designed to cause headaches. Tracks like ""JabPunPlus (OnePlusTwo)"" and ""Fixed Eyes (Slight Return)"" often sound like high-pitched spinning machines thrown off their axis, cycling through patterns that seem to be slipping a gear. The awkwardness and imbalance seems essential to what Sagan is trying to do, but that doesn't make a headphone listen any more pleasurable. More engaging are ""Rosetta Stoned""-- which has a nicely propulsive parallel-universe electro vibe-- and ""Closest Living Relations"". Something of a Krautrock tribute, ""Closest""'s nimble and spacious bass and drum grooves occasionally gives way to powerful mega-distortion riffing. Sagan would prefer to see itself as a multimedia project, and the DVD is ultimately more of an attraction. Absurd short films by Ryan Junell reenact great moments in science with a cast that includes the guys from Matmos and members of Sagan. The acting may be student-film caliber, but the direction is strong, and the DVD's Viewmaster navigation interface has a few of entertaining Easter eggs tucked in corners. In the end it seems that Sagan's music sounds better with something to look at.","J. Lesser, Blevin Blechtom, Wobbly, and director Ryan Junel join forces on this playful CD/DVD package.

'65-'95,Lemon Jelly,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bccfea9e61561daa7572/1:1/w_160/a4495434.gif,2005-02-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4728-65-95/,XL,"Lemon Jelly sell Volkswagens-- and not just because ""The Staunton Lick"" was featured in a 2002 Jetta commercial. Their pastoral music is a smoothie-laden jaunt through the Illini prairie grasslands with your feet listlessly dangling from the passenger side window of your Toureg as you head to the state fair or garage sale or marshmallow sunflower festival. At least that used to be the case. It seems Nick Franglen and Fred Deakin have changed tonal locales, aligning their temperances with the metropolitan. If Lost Horizons was a tryst through a glorious, luminescent countryside, then '64-'95 is the shiftless subway car careening through midtown streets and echoing throughout forgotten, bi-tonal alleys. The country mouse pawns his acoustic guitar for an Ibanez and ditches his walking stick for a Zipcar. With little more than the forgetful ramblings of an elderly man on the intro, ""'88 aka Come Down on Me"" sounds like the background music for mid-90s airplane crime dramas like ConAir or Turbulence-- the ones that always have that squealing White Zombie song in the background. Fortunately, this piece is an anomaly. '64-'95 succeeds when Lemon Jelly stick to their bread and butter: pleasant and facile ambience. ""Make Things Right"" carries a wistful, dignified elegance with its melodious guitar track. When they embark on other journeys, the results feel forced. Tracks like ""Don't Stop Now"" and dance-y ""Stay With You"" feel as sensual as silk-shirted muscleman at overpriced bar whispering in your ear. And ""The Shouty Track"" is as annoying as the five-minute training tape for irritable parents on my desk from National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome. Lemon Jelly stood out from the Thievery Corporations and Amon Tobins by creating something wonderful and energetic. They excelled at painting beauty but apparently have become victims of the city's stealth and sloth. Having discarded layering and complication for realms more well-rehearsed, '64-'95 feels like a postcard from a tourist rather than the urban autobiographies that DJ Shadow and RjD2 are able to so masterfully cohere. Fortunately, there is considerable significance in the album's final track ""Go"". Flighty and driving, Lemon Jelly perhaps will take all they've learned from the metropolis to embark for higher ground, maybe walking tall like Bunyan's Christian from Vanity Fair, wiser and bolder from the knowledge of the city.","This usually pastoral downtempo duo spend a bit of time in the city.

Has a Good Home,Final Fantasy,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beaeea9e61561daa7930/1:1/w_160/2aecd7a1.jpg,2005-02-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3334-has-a-good-home/,Blocks,"""Montreal may eat its young,"" says this record, but the kids up northward seem to be doing alright-- happy and supportive and teaming up in various combinations to crank out records at a rate that lets critics feel refreshingly useful. It's just the kind of scene, in fact, that'll give you a record like Final Fantasy's-- a solo-type project from Owen Pallett, who spends the bulk of his music-time playing and arranging strings for acts like the Hidden Cameras and the Rory Gilmore-approved Arcade Fire. Has a Good Home, though, turns out to be a perfectly charming thing all on its own-- a slight little thing, maybe, but an awfully friendly one. Pallett's a bit of a classicist and a decent writer of low-key pop songs, which he's arranged here with a pleasantly minimal, umm, palette: Mostly just the pizzicato pluck and bowed harmonies of his violin, visited here and there by acoustic guitars, horns, or whatever else seems useful. The setup starts off in a losing battle with Andrew Bird, who's already taken the man/violin/tapeloop triad to incredible levels of elegance. Then you realize that Pallett's songwriting agenda is a little simpler than that--full of enough straight lines and sappy hooks to leave some of these tracks sounding more like the Kings of Convenience are trying to impress a cellist. Somewhere between those poles, Pallett finds enough good moves to make me wish I could follow more of the Canadian references sprinkled through his lyrics. Most immediately winsome is ""This Is the Dream of Win and Regine"", which makes good on its dual namecheck (Dntel/Postal Service, Arcade Fire) with a terrifically sprightly pop number, all stirring 80s melody and delicate violin harmonies. More impressive are the moments where Pallett plays to his strengths and arranges himself like a chamber group: ""That's when the Audience Died"", surely the most gorgeous thing here, starts off with his best vocal performance, then lets the strings well up enough to script some leads. Mix in some gems of genuine Canadian lyricism-- ""she has not been able to sleep/ Since the days of Trudeau""-- and it's all of the album's strengths in four minutes. Unfortunately for us, hits like that lie a little sparse over these sixteen brief tracks. Sometimes it's Pallett's pinched-up voice that falters; sometimes it's that the songs are too rote, sophisticated in form but lacking in flavor. The sedate form, the variations in sound, and the easy-on-the-ears violin tone all keep it pleasant enough company, but a lot of these tracks aren't likely to really grab anyone who hasn't already spent the winter wishing Joanna Newsom were a guy with a normal voice and a more easygoing disposition. For the time being, then, it's just cheers for the good ones: four or five tracks you'd be hard pressed not to wind up charmed by.","Delicate vocal/violin/tapeloop indie pop from Owen Pallett, peripheral Arcade Fire member and string arranger for their landmark debut, Funeral.

Dignity and Shame,Crooked Fingers,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6aab1335d7bf1698ea4/1:1/w_160/c9acac5c.jpg,2005-02-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1673-dignity-and-shame/,Merge,"With the release of Dignity and Shame, former Archers of Loaf frontman Eric Bachmann has now issued as many albums under the Crooked Fingers moniker as with his celebrated indie rock band. During the heady 90s, all Bachmann ever wanted was to be your spine. And now? He's Neil Diamond as hard-luck piano matador. Give him some candy. The title track of Archers' 1998 swan song, White Trash Heroes, hinted at the direction Bachmann's next project would take: ominous, back-porch Americana, centered on his brassy ""Cracklin' Rosie"" vocals rather than spastic punk noise. Bachmann's literate songwriting and (college) radio-ready pop melodicism survived the transition, particularly on orchestra-laden masterpieces like ""New Drink for the Old Drunk"" or ""Angelina"". At a bar, those tracks would be ordering whiskey shot-for-shot with W.C. Fields while most of Dignity and Shame was in the bathroom spewing its second sangria. The latest from Bachmann and his rotating cast of accompanists is a loosely conceptual Iberian love epic. ""Loosely,"" because only three or four songs really relate to the cover art's red-devil bullfighter and the lusty flamenco dancers on the back (the soused narrator of Graceland-bouncy ""Valerie"" probably isn't serenading a señorita). Early reviews invoking the album's ""Southwestern"" influences should be forgiven; surely they meant southwestern Spain, home to the Andalucia province and its many bullrings. Slow-building instrumental opener ""Islero"" sets the scene with Sevillana guitar flourishes, wistful Latin trumpets, and faraway congas. The piece takes its name from the bull that gored the famous matador Manolete to death in 1947. Yet at the song's apex, where a Gipsy Kings dance number might have emerged had Bachmann rolled a strike, instead there's just ""Weary Arms"", a preachy (if catchy) series of cavernous bromides. ""You've been waiting your whole life to make your move/ So make your move,"" we're told. ""Andalucia"" sheds more light on Bachmann's Spanish theme. Pitter-patter drums and a numbing guitar riff square off with wide-open choruses about a girl named Antonita and the album's most allusive lyrics. The summer of 1917 was ""splendid"" in Andalucia, the song asserts, presumably due to romance. This was a few years before Ernest Hemingway's arrival, and Spain was wracked with workers' strikes inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution. It's also the summer Manolete was born. The narrator, a matador himself, boldly challenges the ""Miuras"" -- Islero's breed of bull, and the most feared. But his prayers to Saint Veronica, who is credited with giving Jesus a kerchief to wipe his brow on the road to Golgotha, apparently go unanswered. For some reason (a wound, most likely), the young bullfighter must leave behind Antonita and his homeland for one year. ""Andalucia"" is a farewell love song. Regrettably, no other song here has a lyric nearly as compelling as ""Andalucia""-- a major flaw for what is essentially a pedal steel-enhanced singer/songwriter album. ""Call to Love"" offers an awkward metaphor and one of a few duets with Australian singer Lara Meyerratken. ""How am I supposed to hear or take heed to this call to love?"" is among the stilted lines Bachmann gives her, while the verse melody unflatteringly meshes with Tom Petty's ""American Girl"". As male-female back-and-forth goes, this is no ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers"" (or ""Nothing Better"", or ""I Got a Man"", or...). Dignity and Shame also sheds blood from its chosen genre's double-edged sword: This kind of rootsy, ruminative pop inevitably teeters on the brink of the AAA abyss-- a place where songs are served in tall, grande, and venti. If you thought the previous Crooked Fingers albums showcased Bachmann's softer side, you haven't heard ""Twilight Creeps"", in which he muses, ""Why does everybody act so tough/ When all anybody wants is to find a friend?"" One of the disc's most instantly memorable songs is, for better or worse, ""Twilight Creeps"" is also the first of several where Bachmann's falsetto sounds uncannily like the dude from Five for Fighting. Well, it's not easy to be Bachmann, either: ""Where are you, love?"" he laments on acoustic weeper ""You Must Build a Fire"". And where are you, the subtle genius behind ""Andalucia"" and Vs. the Greatest of All Time? On ""Destroyer"", Bachmann's narrator seems to confuse the intimate/violent man-bull relationship with the interpersonal kind, telling a lover to ""lay down, let it come"" and ""resign your heart today to get blown away."" All of which may or may not be a coded message to Dan Bejar. At least there's a raucous jam at the coda, which the otherwise-forgettable ""Coldways"" also provides. By the album-closing title track, Bachmann's matador-narrator is presumably dead, covered in mud and leaves. He's also back in advice-column mode, tossing out a few rhymes Jimmy Eat World would kill for: ""You've got to carry your heart like a torch in the night/ Little keeper of light/ Burning deep, burning bright."" Dignified? I guess. But this kind of just-good-enough song-manufacturing coming from Bachmann, on a record that glimmers with underdeveloped artistry, is a crying shame. As he explains on ""Sleep All Summer"": ""I would change for you, but babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man.""","With the release of Dignity and Shame, former Archers of Loaf frontman Eric Bachmann has now issued as many albums under the Crooked Fingers moniker as with his celebrated indie rock band.

Naninani II / 50th Birthday Celebration,Yamataka Eye and John Zorn,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab325e6ef959693216ee/1:1/w_160/938b430d.jpg,2005-02-21 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11870-naninani-ii-50th-birthday-celebration/,Tzadik,"Here's a scene to burn into your mind: Yamataka Eye looks up to God with a thick, green vocoder tube dangling from his throat as if he's a 10-second-old newborn. He holds a mic to his lips to emit a noise that is a cross between a mosquito dazedly banging into a porch light and a junior high video class sound effect of a crashing UFO. It's potentially tragicomic, but there is nothing else to do or think about-- just to watch. One's ears can seem like they're bleeding with tinnitus until the camera shifts to the right. John Zorn blows half of his saxophone into a pitcher of water as if on life support, his shoulders high and face shrunken. Zorn is convulsing with each squeal while his comrade adjusts his noise-box for another fix. Eye's electricity now hums into a wail-- leading to a climax where Zorn re-attaches his brass to end the argument with the tone of a drill sergeant's face hit by a recruit's spat. Eye rips the tube out of his mouth and undergoes an epileptic kabuki fit. He almost screeches in key and rhythm to Zorn's blats; ending right on the beat. Their audience at NYC's Tonic applauds as if being on Maury Povich. That QuickTime video clip of ""M.S.T.G.L. (moneysextripgodlove)""-- filmed during one of Zorn's 30-odd birthday party concerts he threw for his 50-year-old self at Tonic in September 2003-- could be another case of testosterone poisoning art. It could also be noise as the phantasmagoric possession of the human soul. Both Zorn and Eye embody the latter-- exposing the tension and sheer camp of the human body's barely domesticated noises. Eye's work with the enigmatic Boredoms often sounded like a rehearsal space with three bands screaming and out-drumming each other just to hear themselves. And then there is Zorn, who could fill libraries with translations of Attention Deficit Disordered-jazz into episodes of Ornette Coleman's America, grindcore metal dirges, and the genre-damming Cobra game-- the rules of which I still can't fathom after the 20th read-through. Both gentlemen can make listeners laugh, flinch, squint, cup their mouths, or walk outside for fresh air. The past few months saw two releases where Eye 'n' Zorn broke bread: 50th Birthday Celebration documents their Sept. 15 gig, while Naninani II is a sequel to their '95 zoo animal revolt. Listening to their new work was masochistic for me. High-pitched tones disturb me, and Zorn cleared my sinuses with one of the more horrific squeals caught live on tape in the 50th Birthday closer, ""Choronzone"". He out-guns Eye after his techie Sawai Taeji deliver a slippery cathedral organ drone that falls into a hole. In the opener, ""Postivia,"" Zorn berates a broken TV, courtesy of Eye's garbled static. The freak show element both entices and repels. In ""Microwavable Empty Highway"", Eye mimics a howler monkey's mating call to Zorn's balladry that places an arm around a stranger in a subway train and tells of modeling (prostitution) opportunities in Hong Kong. ""Sun See Soon"" is an old-fashioned dick around with avant-guitar legend Fred Frith squeaking along with Eye's microphone feedback and Zorn's vile birdsong. Naninani II is stronger with finer studio attention to detail and ambient atmospherics. Echoes of the Boredoms are heard, as ""Espimo""'s rhythms of a pink-elephant chasing-woodblock and the saxophone riffs that tell it to shut up because it's trying to sleep, loosely recall the Osaka band's oldie, ""Your Name is Limitless."" More arresting is ""Fat Anarchy on Airtube"", where Eye's whooshed breaths and rollicking koto noodlings lead to a hymnal drone that seems to make it difficult for someone to breathe, causing him or her to steadily pound the walls. ""Shiso Baba"" revamps the same electronic drone but oddly finds a sort of pantheistic awe in the temple bell tones and Eye's infantile utterances. Elsewhere, ""Kiri Taki"" resembles a mystic chanting a raga and pounding tablas to the tune of a nearby Pole Position arcade machine. The more baffling ""4ab"" lets Zorn serenade to what is either a duck tearing up a newspaper in pond, or a frustrated photographer fumbling one print after another in a darkroom. I don't want to know the sight or smell of whomever produced those noises.",,7.7,
All-Night Fox,The Howling Hex,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c16fc0084474cd0c333d/1:1/w_160/c6dd032c.jpg,2005-02-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4003-all-night-fox/,Drag City,"There are (thankfully) few musicians whose output has been as consistently befuddling or exasperating as that of Neil Michael Hagerty. Charting all the way back to his days in Pussy Galore and straight through his chaotic decade-plus tenure as one half of Royal Trux, Hagerty has always stubbornly concealed the brilliant peaks of his unruly, willfully discordant soul, R&B;, and classic rock refractions beneath a maddening amount of dead-end, solipsistic rubbish. Though Hagerty is too talented to write off completely (during Royal Trux's early-to-mid 90s heyday I would've counted him as one of the most underrated guitar stylists in rock), even the most sympathetic listeners may have grown impatient trying to follow the plot of his oft-rudderless meandering-- particularly in the time since Royal Trux's dissolution. Although the past few years have been among the most productive of Hagerty's career, his work during this period has been scattershot even by his permissive standards, veering incautiously between double-jointed folk, Canned Heat boogie, and half-assed cosmic country without truly excelling at any station. All of which brings us to All-Night Fox, an album credited to Hagerty's new combo, the Howling Hex. Some may recognize the band name from 2003's little-heard Neil Michael Hagerty & the Howling Hex. All-Night Fox is actually the fourth release issued by this mysterious new combo, although the first three were all released in 2004 as limited edition vinyl-only documents. So this record is, for all practical purposes, the group's debut, and happily it illustrates that Hagerty has again, at long last, decided upon a sound to craft as his own. Containing eight tracks, All-Night Fox clocks in at just under 40 minutes, a length that many contemporary acts might call an EP. Opening with the spacious, reverb-laden ""Now, We're Gonna Sing"", the record hits the pavement with all cylinders steaming, as Hagerty's squawking, curve-hugging guitar anticipates every corner, and the group as a whole resembles what might've occurred had Phil Spector ever corralled a teenage Captain Beefheart. The Hex even launches ""Cast Aside the False"" with an near-direct cop of the ""Be My Baby"" beat, a tactic you'd have to be crazy to fault anybody for. Throughout the album, traditional song structures are forsaken for acreage of Hagerty's bleating, harmolodic guitar, neck-snapping male/female vocal tag-teams, and frantic, inscrutable lyrics I couldn't even hope to transcribe. And although it's all delivered with an uncharacteristic degree of focus, one can't help but escape with the belief that All-Night Fox is merely laying the groundwork for a more full-realized colossus to follow, and the hope that Hagerty has come to the same realization as well.","Latest project from ex-Royal Trux man Neil Michael Hagerty.

It's unnerving that this hypothetical machine would eventually achieve philosophical and scientific breakthroughs simply by chancing across the correct combination of words. After spending too much time in Live from Rome's claustrophobic ruins, it's tempting to imagine the remarkably prolix Sole as this engine of pure linguistic potential. Of course, this machine would produce everything between gibberish and eloquent treatises on ethics; following suit, Sole's apparent need to say everything produces songs of varied coherence. Sole's style is meant to be jarring, and to express the clash of impassioned ideology and over-self-consciousness in its author. Many of us uncomfortably recognize the urge to dismiss our own passionately held political beliefs as clichéd, but Sole misfires when he captures this zeitgeist with too much fidelity. When his puns are intentionally bad, his flow intentionally torpid, his polemics intentionally ham-fisted, it raises questions about how intellectual intent mitigates aesthetic effect when gauging artistic value, but can still seem hokey, lazy, or pedantic. How close can a satire come to what it satirizes without becoming it? Sole squanders several of Odd Nosdam's and Alias' polished beats by overstating his case. ""Predictions"" is one example, beginning with a series of groaners-- ""Debbie Gibson will make an electronica comeback/ Ice Cube will go feminist""-- that morph into a caricatured anti-capitalist worst-case scenario. It feels dishonest and artificial, which is unfortunate, because Sole in general seems neither of these. These missteps smack of a visionary who's wandered into an unsound region of his imagination. But there are plenty of winners here as well. ""Self-Inflicted Wounds"", with the comparatively laconic poetry of its lyrics, a liquid flow, and ethereal beat, weaves enchantment from pithy declarations: ""I am to rap what Christian is to Indian,"" Sole spits with fanged poignancy. And in a typically contrary move, he's hidden his four best tracks at the end of the album, as if he were ashamed of their immediate, intuitive appeal. On ""Imsotired"", a piano phrase subtly distends as Sole's distorted flow unapologetically straddles the twitchy drums. ""On Martyrdom"" finds him wreaking havoc on an elaborate 8-bit bounce track. The wafting spoken word of ""Theme"" and the straightforward crunk of ""Drive by Detournment"" ram the point home-- Sole's socialist screeds work well when he raps them like he means them instead of couching them in layers of affected irony. These songs prove him capable of focusing more on visceral appeal and less on stagy esotericism while maintaining his intellectual ambition, and one hopes this album is a steppingstone toward cementing this vision.","This new release from Anticon's Sole swings purposefully between gibberish and eloquence.

The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend,Baby Huey,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47dea9e61561daa4f00/1:1/w_160/74bbe75b.jpg,2005-02-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1151-the-baby-huey-story-the-living-legend/,CurtomCurtom,"James Thomas Ramsey, aka Baby Huey, introduced himself on stage better than anyone else could have dared: ""I'm Big Baby Huey, and I'm 400 pounds of soul."" In the 1960s, he and his band, the Babysitters, played everywhere from the clubs of New York to private parties in Paris, but Chicago was where they were best known-- and where they called home. The band would play any gig that would have them during that time, from tiny blues clubs to cruise ships. As a frontman, Baby Huey was talented, flamboyant, and enormous-- anywhere from 350-400 pounds, topped off by a giant afro. Unfortunately, Huey died of a heart attack at 26 in 1970, and never saw his debut album released the following year. Since then, Living Legend has remained an obscurity, though its songs have long been embraced by hip-hop, having been sampled by everyone from Kool Herc to Eric B and Rakim to Ghostface. This Water Records reissue keeps the album's original running order intact, and adds no extras. Living Legend is a spare effort by today's standards: eight songs, two of them covers-- one of which is among the record's three instrumentals. However, Living Legend showed Huey and the Babysitters stretching themselves in ways few soul artists of the time did. The Babysitters were a full band with a horn section that could take psychedelic detours without losing their tightness or funky feel. They were the perfect foil for Huey, who brought it all together with undeniable stage presence and an earnest tenor that was compared to Otis Redding (which rings true if only for their powerful delivery). Listen closely, and you can hear the ravage of excess in his raspy crooning, before he leaps into the highest registers with a squeal that's equal parts James and Arthur Brown. Produced by the legendary Curtis Mayfield, three songs he also penned make up the meat of the album. ""Mighty Mighty"" is a raucous funk shuffle, including handclaps and crowd noise that give it the feel of a backyard throwdown, with little girls piping in at Huey's invitation while he praises Walgreen's turkeys and Thunderbird in his proto-rapping. Its gaiety is infectious and almost overwhelming. The ""Hard Times"" arrangement seems almost restricting for Huey's voice and character, but we have to thank Mayfield for handing him the tune-- it's the record's most memorable melody, and Huey's version is superior to Mayfield's own. ""Running"" adds warbling electric piano and guitar to Mayfield's melodic funk, the most lamentable example of what the Babysitters could have achieved if Huey had lived to record another LP. And while the band out-performing Mayfield on his own songs is no small feat, the two covers on Living Legend are, for lack of a better phrase, utterly bonkers. Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Going to Come"" begins clunkier than Cooke's version, but one inhuman screech from Huey and the horns kick in and the band dials it up. When the song passes the seven-minute mark (and it eventually stretches past nine), Huey breaks it down and channels the experimentation of his youth into a sermon on ""space odysseys"" and ""funny-lookin' cigarettes."" The other cover is an instrumental version of the Mamas and Papas' ""California Dreamin'"", which straddles the line between smooth flute jazz and The Funky 16 Corners. With very few original songs, Baby Huey and the Babysitters might come off as nothing more than hired guns. Even if that's so, their lone LP proved them versatile and talented as hell. It's a shame that no reissue has rounded up Huey's extraneous 1960s singles, but soul fans will be overjoyed that this record is finding wide release.","Reissue of the only LP from this Curtis Mayfield protégé and self-proclaimed ""400 pounds of soul.""

A Gun Called Tension,A Gun Called Tension,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c016eb335119a49ed327/1:1/w_160/7a0f8a91.jpg,2005-02-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3668-a-gun-called-tension/,Cold Crush,"Rappers take the verse. Singers, whether live or sampled, take the chorus. That's the prevalent formula when combining hip-hop elements with other styles like rock or R&B;, from most of the Judgment Night soundtrack to the Jay-Z/Link Park mashup to almost every Ashanti cameo. There are many ways to circumvent this reliance on dividing style by structural anchors, the most extreme-- and perhaps the most interesting-- of which is to disregard traditional song structures altogether. That's what a collective named A Gun Called Tension do on their self-titled debut, resulting in a highly organic blend of underground hip-hop and indie-rock elements. A Gun Called Tension consists primarily of two musicians: Bay Area rapper Sean Reveron, who collaborated with the Beta Band on their reinterpretation of Three Dog Night's ""One"", and Dann Gallucci, one-time Murder City Devil guitarist and part-time Modest Mouse member. Each corrals a roster of guests: Roots Manuva, Airborne Audio, DJs Andy Sells and Monesa Yamakawa, Coady Willis and Spencer Moody of Murder City Devils, Blood Brother Morgan Henderson, Pretty Girls Make Graves singer Andrea Zollo, and producer Phil Ek. As its name suggests, this project defines itself by tense outrage-- over political realities like the President's ""immaculate deception"" (""5+1""), and over lamentable music trends like the dominance of ""early 80s punk"" in indie music (""Gold Fronts""). While that dissatisfaction injects the lyrics with angry, restless energy, the real tension in the group's name comes from its music, which contrasts blaring rock rhythms with jumbled hip-hop beats and plays up the resultant friction on tracks like ""Treason"", a punk shoutalong that sets Moody's guttural vocals against Gallucci's grinding guitar and Reveron's upbeat flow. While the rock rhythms inform Reveron's delivery, making his flow more singsongy, he remains cool and eerily imperturbable on the intense ""Thelonious"", which beats like the heart of the album's bristling rage. Closing the album proper (before an acceptable ""Thelonious"" remix by Airborne Audio), ""Document"" unleashes that rage in an explosion of indie-rock momentum and urban/nocturnal atmosphere. But the album's high-point is a sung/spoken duet between Reveron and Zollo on ""Electric Chair"", which has all the calm, swaying steadiness of a subway car, even as the uncertainties it documents threaten the singers' self-contemplation. Toward the end Zollo breaks off and sings wordless notes behind his vocals, and the effect is both bracing and haunting. ""Electric Chair"", like so much of this sturdy album, works an understated contrast between calm and frantic, between ethereal and earthy, between confident and conflicted, between rock and rap. The album loses a little of its steam toward the end, when too many songs play up the rap side of the equation over the rock, but on the whole A Gun Called Tension is surprisingly balanced and beholden to no preconceptions of how these two styles should mix. Ultimately, the album cannot redefine these genres (what album could, especially without the benefit of time and hindsight?), but it does expand the possibilities of both, which is no small feat.","Murder City Devils guitarist teams with former Beta Band guest MC.

Woman King EP,Iron & Wine,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b986c0084474cd0c2620/1:1/w_160/9f450777.jpg,2005-02-20 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4128-woman-king-ep/,Sub Pop,"There are a lot of ways to describe Iron & Wine's dark, woozy folk songs: writers and fans scramble to find the appropriate modifiers, the correct verbs, the variations on ""hushed."" We make references to babies and jokes about his beard, launching sweeping comparisons to bedroom poets past, yapping happily about Beam's ""quietude"" and ""grace."" And now, for the very first time, ""loud"" can be added to that arsenal of adjectives: the six-song Woman King EP, a follow-up to 2004's Our Endless Numbered Days, opens with relentlessly click-clacking pieces of wood and a brash slide riff, booming out in all directions. And we haven't even gotten to the electric guitar yet-- or the distortion. Over the course of two full-lengths (and their accompanying EPs), Sam Beam has tweaked and re-imagined Iron & Wine's whisper-folk imprint to include a much broader palette of sound-- anxious and intense, Woman King inches Beam even farther away from his scratchy lo-fi origins without sacrificing any of the microphone-eating intimacy that made his work so appealing to begin with. Woman King was recorded at producer Brian Deck's Engine Music Studios in Chicago (under identical circumstances, but separate from the Our Endless Numbered Days sessions) and features Deck's trademark mix of grainy, untreated percussion and spare-but-layered production (not atypically, Deck is also credited as a band member). Somehow, each step Beam takes feels organic, proper, true-- Woman King (much like Our Endless Numbered Days) is different, but fundamentally linked to its predecessors. Iron & Wine's album titles are almost always prophetic (2002's The Creek Drank the Cradle dealt with fizzled innocence, 2004's Our Endless Numbered Days tackled human mortality) and Woman King is, for the most part, about girls-- fallen, absent, beloved, virginal, and nefarious. Thwarted religion has always provided prime lyric fodder for Beam, and the stunning ""Jezebel"" recounts the rise and fall of the Bible's most infamous Phoenician princess, a pagan follower who becomes involved in a political marriage to Ahab, the crown prince of Israel. According to the Bible, Jezebel caused loads of trouble for Israel until Jehu, the head of a company formed to overthrow the house of Ahab, has her snatched and tossed from a window. Her blood splatters the palace wall; Jehu, on horse and chariot, charges across the body. Later, when palace servants return to recover Jezebel's corpse for burial, all that's left is her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands. Jehu announces that Jezebel was chewed up by a pack of dogs, fulfilling the divine prophet Elijah's earlier prediction that ""the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel."" Beam gently acknowledges Jezebel's brutal end (""The window was wide/ She could see the dogs come running""), but doesn't necessarily swallow the Bible's cautionary bent: Jezebel is typically read as villainous (with decent reason: she falsely accuses citizens of blasphemy and treason, and orders them stoned to death), but recent feminist re-interpretations of her story have questioned whether or not that vilification can simply be chalked up to the threat she posed to ancient patriarchal orders. Beam plays with his words (a glance at the lyric sheet reveals that he's actually singing ""wholly Jezebel,"" but, you know, say it out loud), and laments how Jezebel was ""gone"" before he ever got to say ""Lay here my love/ You're the only shape I'll pray to, Jezebel."" Ultimately, Beam casts Jezebel as more of a heroine (or an object of worship, even) than a righteously fallen pagan, turning ""Jezebel"" into a perfectly chilling ode to potentially misunderstood women. A stripped-down version of ""Jezebel"" can be heard on the officially unreleased (but slipped under many pillows) bootleg 9/20/02 Home Recordings, a collection of demos largely believed to be the Iron & Wine songs Sub Pop opted not to use for Beam's debut. Still, the studio take of ""Jezebel"" is far fleshier, with Beam's classic guitar and banjo strums backed up by tinkling piano and tiny dulcimer swats-- a dizzying, wispy haze of strings and high, falsetto-coos that hold up well against Beam's very best work. ""Freedom Hangs Like Heaven"", while no less religiously charged (""Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds/ But his mama says he'll walk on water and wander back home""), is a boisterous, slide-fueled throwdown, perfectly acceptable for barn-dancing or open-armed room stomping. ""Gray Stables"" shows off Beam's knack for harmony (while singing with sister Sarah), ""My Lady's House"" is vintage Iron & Wine, all acoustic guitar, slight piano, and lovelorn laments, while closer ""Evening on the Ground (Lilith's Song)"" is a tense, distorted ode to dark garden trysts (interpret ""We were born to fuck each other/ One way or another"" however you like), complete with spider bites and broken locks and urgent, throaty vocals. Woman King will provide eager Iron & Wine fans a welcome holdover between proper albums, but the EP also serves a larger developmental purpose, marking one more evolutionary hop for Sam Beam, and christening a new genre-- post-basement.","This six-track EP sees Sam Beam go electric. Recorded with producer Brian Deck, Woman King inches Beam away from his scratchy lo-fi origins without sacrificing any of the microphone-eating intimacy that made his work so appealing to begin with.

The Cloud Making Machine,Laurent Garnier,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bef2c0084474cd0c2f77/1:1/w_160/75645c61.jpg,2005-02-17 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3401-the-cloud-making-machine/,Mute,"Laurent Garnier has played the Antonio Salieri of the French electronic scene, spending years studying and publicizing the genre only to take a backseat to major-label Mozarts like Air, Cassius, and-- of course-- Daft Punk. But while these newcomers were living it up in the house scene that Garnier built, the veteran DJ pressed on with several commendable, although modestly received, full-lengths. What Garnier can lack in feeling, he makes up for with years of technical know-how, on The Cloud Making Machine as before. Songs like ""Huis Clos"" and ""Act 1 Minotaure Ex."" are dark and colossal, as if recorded in some massive sub-aquatic lair. ""Barbiturik Blues"" clearly sprouts from the same mind that flavored his late 1980s house and techno with refreshing amounts of jazz. The song showcases casino-cool mellotron improv over an impeccably modulated drum beat. Between the two instruments, Garnier drops space-age blips and beeps, just to top it all off. Garnier's logged many years in this biz spinning Madchester, penning books, and curating compilations-- he's heard a lot and his palate is wide. That said, Garnier's genre-hopping tendency costs him his personality, a common sacrifice for DJs. ""9.01-9.06"" drips with Richard D. James envy; its ominous bassline sounds like a mere video game score compared to Aphex Twin's more menacing bass patterns. ""(I Wanna Be) Waiting For My Plane"" sounds like an electronic mutation of The Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" with a shitty Iggy Pop, restored by scratchy digital sheen. All in all, despite failing to live up to their originals, the tracks change up the album's pace nicely and allow Garnier to show off more electro toys. Garnier's idea for a more cerebral, emotional album is wise; 2000's Unreasonable Behaviour, with its vocoders and pretentious lyrics, begged too hard for attention. At the risk of sounding cold, the only thing about The Cloud Making Machine that could be considered pretentious is that it has a concept-- in this case, the Parisian homeless. Come on, Laurent, how am I supposed to help the homeless when I can't stop digging these beats?!","The man with the red face crafts something dark and colossal.

This Cloud Is Learning,Nicolai Dunger,by: Stephen M.

He almost never made it this far: He was so unhappy with this earliest records-- 1996's Songs Wearing Clothes and 1997's Eventide, both released by Swedish label Telegram-- that he contemplated quitting music altogether. A chance meeting with members of the Soundtrack of Our Lives persuaded him otherwise, and he made This Cloud Is Learning with them in 1999. It was Dunger's two subsequent albums, Soul Rush (with the Esbjorn Svensson Trio) and Tranquil Isolation (with Will Oldham, among others), that were released in the United States-- in 2001 and 2003, respectively-- but This Cloud Is Learning, now released with two negligible bonus tracks, was his first true artistic statement. Despite its flaws, it is the root of everything that has come after/before. This Cloud Is Learning is not far removed from Soul Rush or Tranquil Isolation, yet it sounds more soulful than the former and more dynamic than the latter, which was at once too tranquil and too isolated. The Soundtrack of Our Lives (which I refuse to abbreviate to the common SOOL, as it suggests they live in penthouse refrigerators, possess Sigourney Weaver, and transmogrify into giant marshmallow men) provide nicely understated accompaniment to Dunger's mannered vocals. Kalle Gustafsson's bowed double bass adds an eerie j-horror rumble to ""Father"", and Martin Hederos' harpsichord stitches spookily through ""If I Were a Little Star"", which contains a disarming major-key melody embedded in its minor-key gloominess. The members of Soundtrack understand their sidemen roles, providing measured back-up without distracting from or overshadowing Dunger's lyrics or vocals. That rightfully makes Dunger the focal point. More so than on his more recently recorded albums, his voice often disregards consonants as it ranges from mewling to drunkenly garbled and hints at future comparisons to Van Morrison, Thom Yorke, and Jeff Buckley. He sounds best when he slows the tempo and creates a subdued, gelid atmosphere in songs like ""Independence"" and ""Songbegging"", whose spectral simmer sets the mood for the album and compensates for the lyrics' occasional dips into sentimental smudginess. However, when Dunger speeds up the tempo and attempts to rise from the gloom, This Cloud Is Learning becomes almost insufferably precious, especially on ""Butterflyin' Friend"" and ""Something in the Way"" (which is neither a Beatles nor a Nirvana cover). Only ""What Tomorrow"", a Kinksy number set apart by mariachi horns and Dunger's emphatic delivery, manages to sustain a faster tempo and capture the Piteå Hillbilly pop aesthetic he's after. That album title, ultimately, is significant: Not only is This Cloud Is Learning a reassertion of Dunger's musical principles, but it sounds like an openly instructive experience for him as he explores the dynamics of collaboration and the range of his voice and lyrics.","Former Will Oldham collaborator teams with fellow countrymen the Soundtrack of Our Lives.

Come on-- I can't help but resent this latest 80s punk-funk pillaging. The LES/EV spirit is stamping ART on poverty and selling it to suckers like me as ""the influential underground"" whose influence today is, if anything is to their credit, masterful self-prophecy. Now America's one-stop thugged-out sweats shop is handing out this most killerest cheatsheet to the 80s mutant music underground for free!-- robbing the shit of its most fundamental irony, trading the weathered taxi driver confessions of Clinton Street gang wars and permanent arson for kewl in-store disco beats and a people's history glorified unwittingly and out of context. My mouth, therefore an error. So what if they're a bit late to the fray, Hollertronix's Diplo and Low B make up for their unshocking entrance with perfect fascism and a generous, well-mixed tracklist. The disc's We Were There liners and cutesy CDDB joke (the mix dates back to 1985 hardy har) could have been throwaways; instead Hollertronix make good on the conceit, geniusing the mix levels for uncanny vinyl reproduction fidelity and never exceeding the technical capabilities contemporary to the music they're handling. Maybe not the most compelling MO for new bands, kids hawking ESG riffs without a hitch, etc., but Hollertronix's coroner hand presentation is the mix's biggest feather-- no bright white spotlights, no museum lines, all chalk and putrefaction. At this point my sense of what's 80s underground/what's not is pretty damn skewed, but Siouxsee's ""Happy House"" is on here, so is that Sexual Harrassment song ""If I Gave You A Party"" that Syrup covered for 2003's Sound Of Young New York comp, so is Arthur Russell's ""Bang"", and for whatever reason there's a Konk song on the mix too (though thankfully it's the least worthless Konk song). Since the mix never purports to be a best of punk-funk or even a punk-funk primer, Hollertronix do indulge themselves on both sides of the blur (Talking Heads, and later, apparently, Landslide's ""It's A Party""). 11 tracks, 29 actual songs, no tracklisting-- the mix aims for mood where others have aimed for completism, probably the biggest and most important indulgence of them all here. Legwarmers: that means fewer annoying iPod track turnovers on your way to Atrium.","This punk-funk Hollertronix disc is like a director's cut of Playgroup's primarily early-80s Partymix, Vol. 1.

Ward who make me contemplate why I write about music. I get my skin tingling to the acoustic guitars and I'm just thinking ""Jesus, is this what it's about?"" I'm trying to put the feeling this music gives me into words in an attempt to understand it, to convey how great it is and why, and maybe convince you that it's worth your cash or your bandwidth, and it occurs to me that I'm unsure why I do it-- why I need to do it-- and that, in the end, it's because I'm enjoying this and I want you to enjoy it, too. Heaven knows you don't build cred or a reputation as a trend-breaker boosting a guy like M. Ward to the rafters with acclaim, because he's not one of those musicians who bothers with belonging to a movement or a trend. He's just going on with that beautifully flawed voice of his (a high, hollow tenor with a fringe of grit) spinning melodies that remind you that, though you're weary of the world, you're not alone. His last record, 2004's magnificent Transfiguration of Vincent is at once sprawling and intimate. It's grown on me like strangling vines in the last year and I can play it anytime around anybody without a worry. This one is just a little tiny bit less perfectly imperfect than that album, but it's still got all the warmth and gentle disorganization of its predecessor-- with a few more oomphy tracks standing in for Tranfiguration's most introspective meditations. For a study of Ward's songwriting ingenuity, just dive into ""Paul's Song"" and listen to the way he leads the verse through a countryish backing, steel guitar straddling the line between Nashville and Honolulu. You figure the melody has to go down at the end of the first verse, but instead he takes it higher and draws it out into a totally unexpected, twisting refrain. Forget verse/chorus/verse, though, because it goes where it has to, just like the traveling character in Ward's lyrics, who laments ""Seems like everywhere I go the sky is falling/ When I come to town, I ain't gonna' lie to you/well, every town is all the same."" It flows so swiftly into the half-time strumming of ""Radio Campaign"" that they could be parts of a suite; taking in the whole album, it occurs to me that maybe they are. Transistor Radio, like his other albums, is stuffed with over a dozen short songs that each reflect a different side of the same shape, glistening facets of a rough-cut Americana diamond-- one crafted not simply from folk and bluegrass but also 50s AM radio, the saloon cabaret of studio-era Hollywood, and good old-fashioned indie rock. Closer ""Well-Tempered Clavier"" extends further afield, a sad, enveloping baroque guitar reverie-- let it be noted that Ward is one helluva guitarist, even if he doesn't often play it up. By now, I remember exactly why I'm writing about this stuff. Because it's fun to get shamelessly giddy and lose yourself in the attempt to articulate your love for a piece of music, if describing it adequately bears the whiff of futility. Seriously, words will often inadequately describe great music, so let's be direct: Listen to this. You will not regret it.","M.

Then, hoping to ""forget the initial punk or new wave background of each song,"" they tackled 1980s faves from the likes of the Cure, the Clash, and Joy Division. The supposed ignorance of the singers plays well for this record's lack of irony, a big part of what makes it succeed as a well-meaning, well-executed novelty. Nouvelle Vague put their most sacrilegious foot forward, opening the album with a cover of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". With the sounds of the tide heard behind the strums of a nylon-string guitar and vocalist Eloise adding playful, bouncy accents to Ian Curtis' weighty lyric, this is frothy, effervescent pop with a touristy feel but no trace of the original's weight. And that's pretty much the MO for the rest of the record, too: The vocalist on ""Guns of Brixton"" sounds like she's never been near a gun, nor to Brixton, and the singer of the playful romp taken through ""Too Drunk to Fuck"" sounds as if she learned the operative word the day of recording, her voice veering from coquettish to near-hysterical. However, the most effective songs re-interpret the originals while maintaining their mood. The Specials' ""Friday Night Saturday Morning"" starts out with ""Space Oddity"" acoustic panache and turns the partying ennui of the original into palpable melancholy, making it the stunning highlight of this disc. Tracks like ""Marian"" and ""A Forest"" retain bits of their original foreboding and hold up better to repeated listening, as does as the smiling rumble-pop of ""Just Can't Get Enough"". Nouvelle Vague certainly treat genre with the same casual respect as their source material-- they're unafraid to add French pop, cocktail jazz, or trip-hop overtones to their bossa nova template. But if Nouvelle Vague intended these versions to be enjoyed without context, doesn't the choice of songs limit their audience? I'm sure there's a small crossover, but there can't be many fans of French bossa nova could possibly be clamoring for covers of Tuxedomoon or Killing Joke.","French bossa nova duo re-imagines new wave classics with the help of vocalists unfamiliar with the 80s originals.

In addition to the Strap's umpteen releases, in 2002 Moffat also introduced his solo project Lucky Pierre, debuting with the entrancing Hypnogogia album. In this alter ego (whose name has since been shortened to the more polite L Pierre) Moffat creates deeply chilled, evocative instrumentals utilizing little more than manipulated loops of scratchy orchestral samples and languid programmed beats. But despite the humbleness of these tools, Hypnogogia managed to wordlessly plumb the same murky depths of emotion that Moffat explores behind the mic at his regular gig, which isn't bad considering that he reportedly first created the album to help put himself to sleep. Touchpool picks up where Hypnogogia nodded off, with the vibrant strings of opener ""Crush"" inviting listeners back under the blankets. While its predecessor was recorded in dribs and drabs over a period of years, all of the tracks here were conceived and recorded as one unified piece, giving Touchpool a more dynamic, thoughtful structure. Also helping to stir these waters is the strategic addition of live instrumentation to several tracks. Moffat's Arab Strap partner Malcolm Middleton provides guitar and bass, giving the lazy shimmer of ""Baby Breeze"" a hypnotic shoegaze swirl. And Dave McGowan's lilting pedal steel lends ""Jim Dodge Dines at the Penguin Café"" an exotic, Morricone-gone-tropical flavor as his playing glides effortlessly from wide-open prairie C&W; to Hawaiian-inflected palm tree sway. Other highlights include ""Velbon"", which gently stretches a sample of Beethoven's ""Pathetique"" Piano Sonata to its ambient limits (its title is a mash-up of Ludwig Van's initials and Brian Eno's last name) and the epic closer ""Total Horizontal"", the serenity of which is enhanced by Allan Wylie's melodious trumpet contributions. In fact if there's a major complaint to be leveled against Touchpool it's that it perhaps contains an overabundance of such serenity. Moffat's lo-tech, limpid beats can occasionally seem like something of an afterthought, and there's certainly little here more uptempo than the BPM at which you might sip a glass of top-shelf whiskey. However, if you've been searching for companionship during those sleepless, after-hour vigils for the approaching dawn, L Pierre has here kindly supplied a handsome flock of sheep for you to count.","Second album of evocative instrumentals from Arab Strap's Aidan Moffat.

Believe,Th' Legendary Shack-Shakers,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bddec0084474cd0c2dbe/1:1/w_160/ee292464.jpg,2005-02-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4979-believe/,Yep Roc,"With a title like Believe, you'd think Th' Legendary Shack-Shakers have a specific something to believe in. And yet, the album's cover displays a mishmash of Christian or Muslim hands clasped in prayer, an upside-down star with funky characters on it, palmistry lines on the creepy hand, astrological symbols, crosses, some sort of masonic/Egyptian eye, devil horns, and the sun and moon. What's all that supposed to mean? It's like Douglas Adams' electric monk or something, programmed to believe up to 17 contradictory ideas at once. Electric monkism follows the band into its music-- cowpunk/psychobilly that deals in quasi-religious/sacreligious vagaries but only hints at a connection to the group's ironic Southern Baptist image. Clearly, they're not theologists, and they seem to think Satan's kinda neat in a noncommital way, so don't come for the preaching-- come for a shit-kicking good time. Th' Legendary Shack-Shakers could be considered style over substance but their music is so much fuxD1and, besides, they do style very well. They open the album with its high point-- a badass klezmer/rockabilly hoedown called ""Agony Wagon"", which kicks off with clarinet and accordion riffing, sweet shuffling drums, and fired-up vocal. They seem to realize how good it is, reprising it in the album's closing instrumental. In between, there's plenty of swaggering and stomping about, with big-reverb cowpunk like ""Bible Cyst"" and ""Where's the Devil...When You Need Him?"" rubbing up against the ramshackle acoustic waltz ballad ""The Pony to Bet On"" and distorted hard rock(abilly) numbers like ""Cussin' in Tongues"" and the Sonny Boy Williamson/Willie Dixon cover ""Help Me"". The mouth harp gets plenty of action, especially on ""Fistwhistle Boogie"", where vocalist Col. J.D. Wilkes lets loose on the thing like an Old Western mob on a prisoner. Believe is the second album from the Shack-Shakers (they had the gall to name the first one Cock-a-Doodle-Don't), and by the sound of things they've grown quite comfortable with their spiritually ambiguous ways and more importantly with their brand of wild, raving psychobilly. I actually wish they'd extended the klezmer tip through the whole album, because it's their most interesting card to play, but the chicken shack rock they came up with instead is full of enough piss and vinegar for a plenty good time.","Southern Baptist imagery meets klezmer/rockabilly on this band's second album.

Ruin Everything!,We Versus the Shark,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaa3b1335d7bf16996d9/1:1/w_160/7cc25497.jpg,2005-02-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8785-ruin-everything/,Hello Sir,"Athens quartet We Versus the Shark owes an obvious debt to Fugazi. But to understand the origins of their whirring melodic arithmetic, spastic disco-punk, and art-damaged pop, it's more helpful to examine three bands who took Ian McKaye's post-punk vision in a new direction-- Dismemberment Plan, Q and Not U, and Les Savy Fav-- at their respective turning points. These can be located between Les Savy Fav's 1999 album The Cat and the Cobra and their 2000 EP Emor; between Q and Not U's 2000 album No Kill Beep Beep and 2002's Different Damage; and between Dismemberment Plan's 1997 album Is Terrified and 1999's Emergency and I. In each case, the departure involved a paring away of excesses. Les Savy Fav lost a guitarist, Q and Not U lost a bassist, and Dismemberment Plan lost all their inhibitions about what you could do in the context of a punk rock song. Each began to rely less on hardcore conventions, more on textural minimalism and innovative structures. Each began to plumb disco and new wave for their kinetic exhortations, essentially becoming experimental pop bands while maintaining their post-punk foundations. In doing so, each produced a record so far ahead of its predecessor that it seemed a step on the evolutionary ladder had been bypassed. It's this ghost interim that We Versus the Shark, a temporally displaced missing link, occupies. With three singers, two guitarists, and a rhythm section that doesn't live up to the otherworldly precision of the Plan but is nevertheless solid and promising, We Versus the Shark has turned out a nervous, twitchy, hooky, disjointed dance-punk rave-up. It's too bad the term ""angular"" has been abused into meaninglessness, since the Shark's guitar attack really is all knees and elbows and sharp corners. Ruin Everything! is a flurry of sparkling detail and fragmentary hooks that somehow accrue into cohesive songs. From the splintering, streamlined funk and hoarse exhortations of ""You Don't Have to Kick It"", to the syncopated percussion and clustered freak-outs of the chameleonic ""Ten Uh Clock Heart Uh Tack"", to the side winding, snake charming shimmy of ""This Graceless Planet"", this record refuses to hold still long enough to draw a bead on it. ""I am at the Mercy of an Ambulance Driver"" combines the quirky vocal fillips Q and Not U deployed with such success on ""Soft Pyramids"" with the paradoxically inert yet gliding micro-disco of the best Dismemberment Plan songs. Ruin Everything! augers a more ""mature"" record in We Versus the Shark's future, but as is, it's perfect for blowing up basements rather than packing mid-sized venues. While I'm sure we'll applaud their more polished efforts, we'll also miss the unfettered energy of their debut, the same way you sometimes pine for the rawness of The Cat and the Cobra or Is Terrified while enjoying Go Forth or Change.","This Athens quartet trades in whirring melodic arithmetic, spastic disco-punk, and art-damaged pop.

Absence,Dälek,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88b9d034d5c69bf3a87/1:1/w_160/f48cb99a.jpg,2005-02-16 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2149-absence/,Ipecac,"I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to describe Dälek's third album without making it sound repetitive and boring, two things it most certainly isn't. Whereas many modern hip-hop albums spill over with infectious beats and sci-fi sounds, and draw variety from a wide array of hired-in producers and guest spots, this does the opposite: It's the product of just three guys-- Dälek, Oktopus, and Still-- and the entire record is built around essentially a couple of simple beats with slight yet important variations. Dälek have a knack for taking basic elements and sculpting them differently every time, a controlled, deliberate attack designed for pinpoint destruction and insight. They can turn a sheet of blistering, white-hot skree into a convincing hook simply by attaching it to the right part of the beat and controlling the volume and density of the noise, allowing Dälek's complex, considered rhymes to weave their way through the tangle. Here, the harsh, cavernous textures coating the songs are ostensibly all dissonant, droning walls of noise cut through with scratches and samples. The templates of Dälek's tracks are augmented by an incredible wealth of detail in both their beats and backdrops. Cascading flumes of gutter noise torment the edges of ""Asylum (Permanent Underclass)"": They heave and bend, wavering in pitch and contorting into snatches of tortured melody. Close listening reveals that the squall is actually a tight cluster of dozens of drones, added and subtracted to mold the music into grit-teethed crescendos and dizzying passages of spiraling, exquisitely controlled chaos. Dälek the MC spits head-spinning verses like ""Who trades his culture for dollars/ The fool or the scholar/ Griot, poet, or white collar"" (""Culture for Dollars"") and ""Seen your movements through peripheral/ Remain same individual/ When a man's viewed as criminal to act animal is logical"" (""Distorted Prose""). There's nary a nod to sex or personal enrichment, and in fact he opens the album by rapping, a cappela, ""Broke stride as last of men realized their deep deceit/ This troubling advance of half-assed crews crowd these streets,"" a broad and open indictment of what he seems to see as hip-hop straying from its early ideals. In ""Eyes to Form Shadows"", he speeds up his flow as melody is forcibly wrenched from queasy, metallic tones, before culminating with ""Addicts move in slow increments within granite/ Hands bound and damaged are weapons we brandish/ Deemed savage by masses/ When this anger's just average."" Dälek's unsatisfied with nearly everything-- and politics are no exception. On ""Asylum"", he skewer administration arrogance and fear-mongering with clear-eyed and direct lyrics that avoid the tendency toward opaque abstraction that bogs down so much underground hip-hop. Crunching along in an endlessly innovative fashion, Absence seems old-school in its simplicity, clarity and forthrightness, but sounds futuristic. And although the album is full of abstract noise and painstaking sound sculpture, the no-nonsense approach to beat-making and Dälek's modest flow make this album more accessible than its presecessor, 2002's From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots. That album had higher peaks than this one, but Absence is more consistently engaging-- and another powerful statement from one of modern hip-hop's greatest crews.","Dälek follow 2002's From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots with another collection of dense, well-sculpted hip-hop.

Sing Out America!,Decibully,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba1c0084474cd0c28d4/1:1/w_160/37d61b3c.jpg,2005-02-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2595-sing-out-america/,Polyvinyl,"Short version: These dudes have absorbed a lot of Pink Floyd, Nick Drake, and Jeff Buckley. They sound just like For Stars. If you need more than that, read on. The pun in Decibully's band name implies both extreme volume and aggression, yet Sing Out America!, Decibully's third record, is all about undistorted shimmer and twang, foppish vocals, and geniality. It's more of a chummy handshake than the middle finger you might expect, unless you know the Milwaukee septet's claim to fame is that singer William Seidel spent some time as an auxiliary nice-guy in the Promise Ring. Plus, some folks seem excited that it includes members of Camden. There's something very heartland about Sing Out America!; something wide-eyed and candid. Besides the usual rock equipment, Decibully doesn't scrimp on the lap steel, banjo, and Rhodes organ, and Seidel's singing is accomplished in that anonymous, androgynous way. It falls somewhere between Thom Yorke and Geoff Farina, and bears no trace of indie rock's trademarked slacker sneer. Sing Out America! is a turbo-Anglo heartstring tug-o'-war; it's unabashedly rootsy and aimed squarely at the Barnes and Noble listening station. The record begins with ""I'm Gonna Tell You"", an approximate waltz that blossoms with sweetly psychedelic swirls and slabs of buzzing bass, restlessly bustling up and down the octave, then diminishing until only the percussion remains. It rolls into ""Megan and Magill"", a foot-stomping barn dance brimming with banjo, hand claps, martial drum rolls, and gigantic vocals. ""Rid of Me at Last"" is an easygoing country-rock ballad dripping with weepy bent strings and luau chords. Sing Out America! is a solid spin, well played and competently sequenced, with a few moments of genuine interest: ""Temptation"", the a capella number, is engaging, despite its ponderous lyrics. But the record as a whole is too glassy and frictionless for it to have much long-term replay value; instead, it's an amiable surface for the ear to skim along.","Hardly the exercise in volume their bandname might suggest, it's more rootsy indie pop from Polyvinyl.

All the Plans Resting,Readymade,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31813d19756521389ef/1:1/w_160/09f88642.jpg,2005-02-15 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6940-all-the-plans-resting/,Where Are My,"Nearly two years after albums like Who Will Cut Our Hair Out When We're Gone and Heart made their stir, Montreal is only now being proclaimed ""the next big scene"" in features namechecking long-settled tenets Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Kid Koala, and Akufen. With all eyes fixed on the Land of Poutine, Vancouver knew it could do better and went woodshedding. If 2003 was the year Quebec vied with Brooklyn for crown jewel status in the fiefdom of hep, 2005 might be the year the western Canucks seize the throne from the peaks of Whistler/Blackcomb on high. Which means bands like Black Mountain, the Organ, and Readymade should earn their mainstream pittance 'round 2007? Readymade must feel like they've waited long enough. All the Plans Resting, the band's third album, marks its 10th anniversary. Until now, the British Columbia quintet have sported arresting, slightly precious dream pop. All the Plans Resting sees them focusing their sound and futzing around with an acoustic guitar. Kevin Hilts is a Christo of MIDI pads, guilelessly wrapping Readymade's sonic superstructures in bright billowy fabric. I wasn't lying when I said precious. Readymade sing fuzzy-wuzzy-- if less flagellant-- high school idylls (""Venetian light stripes the room/ Faded by highball perfume""), which are thankfully offset by the often breathtaking instrumentals. ""The Fake But No Finish"", from which that prolix nugget was drawn, is a jangly echo-fried nod to Electr-O-Pura-era Yo La Tengo. The band share lyric-writing responsibilities; three out of five members penned verses for All the Plans Resting, with Hilts' six vocal sheets leading the way. The keyboardist likes to romanticize his efforts as a penman: On ""Nightsky of Exit Signs"", atop soft swelling synths and pirouetting acoustic guitar, the verse (as sung by vocalist Arch) goes, ""Writing lyrics on the back of a magazine by my bed in the light of computer screen, as if I'm the drama, as if I'm cinema."" The MIDI pads ring of shlock, but the song is lent an edge by the swift emergence of a keening oscillated guitar melody. All the Plans Resting is a headphones record. Don't even try bumping it in your Jeep, it won't make sense. Over 13 tracks, the record stays its course, but it can be a long and arduous trek. Readymade work within consistent dynamics and tempi; after 10 years, they know what they do well, and are almost too comfortable resting on their strengths. As such, All the Plans Resting can seem a slog-- a pretty one, yes-- but any monotony is redeemed by the catchiness of ""The Fake But No Finish"" and ""Outlast By Rain"". A decade into their career, Readymade have realized their best record, and the band's shear endurance should be an inspiration to a burgeoning scene awaiting wider recognition.","Vancouver dream pop band issues their third album in 10 years.

These guys are Huck Finns dropping the n-word before they're neo-Nazis pushing an F&F; agenda. They're four San Diego Dada-dudes with trad hardcore beefs-- macho guys, stupid girls, and authority figures-- and when singer Brandon Welchez shrieks, ""We French-kissed in a holding cell and licked our flames in birthday Hell,"" he's only describing love using the terms of the twisted metalcore realm he dwells in. The Plot deftly navigate through jazz, punk, and metal with pinpoint precision, willfully mangling their songs while still retaining a sense of structure. Opener ""Reichstag Rock"" collapses from Tourette's before a steady, colossal metal riff restores order and brings the song home. Midway through ""Lipstick SS"", everyone forgets how to play their instruments for almost a minute when suddenly the band stumbles across a dance-punk groove. The energy's huge, but the Plot's key strength is guitar melodies. ""Vulture Kontrol"" churns on a cheeky bassline until it's interrupted by-- am I about to say this?-- a nasty riff reminiscent of Castlevania 3 for NES. Before the song unwinds into a collage of piano pounding, ""Angry, Young, and Rich"" packs plenty of guitar arpeggios and a staccato, drama-charged pre-chorus. Complaining about unintelligible hardcore vocals is a lost cause, but it's a shame here: lines like ""You want a reaper that's handsome and abusive,"" believe it or not, would add a lot more personality to the Plot's already proactive songs. Then again, maybe Welchez intended to conceal lines like ""Kisses sweet as heroin yet cold like teenage sex"" because he thought the metaphor was too sappy. Whatever the reason, Welchez's lack of clarity only increases the role of the other members, which is perfectly fine. On ""Failure on Vain Street"", the derisive guitar parody of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" and tongue-in-cheek cowbells manage to convey the same fuck-the-system attitude of Welchez's garbled voice: ""Nail any uniform coffin black/ Want my hair as short as nails/ March, march, march."" With personification like this, it won't be long before the FCC starts handing out ""Warning: Explicit Instruments"" stickers and kids can't buy a saxophone without showing some ID.","San Diego art-punks navigate jazz, punk and metal, willfully mangling their songs yet retaining a taut sense of structure on their Revelation debut.

Silent Night / Variations: A Movement in Chrome Primitive,William Basinski,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a226ea9e61561daa4984/1:1/w_160/e27d88e1.jpg,2005-02-15 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11663-silent-night-variations-a-movement-in-chrome-primitive/,2062,"I'd call it ""fast"", as in: alarmingly out of control, spiraling nowhere but in a righteous hurry to get there. This is life I'm talking about, and it's killing me at the moment. I suppose that's what life does, ultimately, but must it move at so breakneck a pace? The past month has been one of feeling caught up in the flow of people, work, and events just hoping to come out on the other end: Day job's a mess, the train rides are long, my poor wife is being dragged all over the country by her job, there are cats to feed and bills to pay and too much e-mail, and it's all enough to make one quite sleepy, but at the same time too agitated to fall asleep easily. So. Everybody feels this way now and then, but what the crap does this have to do with William Basinski? Well, everything and nothing. Basinski has really nothing to do with fast or the too-quickness of life and everything to do with the antidote. I'm not even going to skirt around it: Lately, I've been listening to basically nothing but Afrobeat and drone-based ambient music. It's a strange combination, but this month that's what I'm in the mood for. Basinski's records, of course, falls in the latter camp (I've yet to find anything that falls into both camps-- if anyone out there has a tip, drop me a line). Basinski has his own unique ambient voice. Slowness is the thing with Basinski-- well, not the only thing, but one thing, and an important one-- and as if to drive home the point, his most celebrated work, The Disintegration Loops, took a couple of decades to make. Not by design, mind you, as he had no way of knowing how his stored tapes would decay over time, but it's nice to think about a piece of music incubating before finally being offered to the world at large. But more broadly, his music is unhurried and develops very slowly, rather unlike the information-soaked world it's meant to enrich. His two most recent releases are not things you just listen to in dribs and drabs. You need to actually have a seat and take them in; you need to put aside time to be alone with the music, which is marvelous, I think, because it forces you to realize just how much you're rushing in your daily comings and goings. Silent Night is the shorter of the two pieces and can be succinctly described as an ambient excursion built of soft, humming drones that swell and recede under and over a hissing, bug-like drone. For an hour. That's all it is, superficially, but there's so much more going on here, manifested in the irregular intervals between swells, the way a rapid succession of hums play off of the drones, and the alternately melancholy and joyous manner in which the sounds recede and return. And the sound. Ooh, such timbres. These are sounds you can really dig into-- rounded, water-smooth sounds with palpable surface tension and mile-thick bass whale calls that seem to have a soul. Unfortunately, the bugs get the last ten or so minutes to themselves, but up 'til then it's magic. Variations, like The Disintegration Loops, was originally created in 1981, remained unreleased for ages, and involves metamorphosis through reiteration. It sprawls, to say the least, over two discs-- each split courteously into four sections for listening ease-- all made of the same elements: piano loops played against each other in endless variations. The piano recordings aren't laid straight out in front of you, though-- they're coated in a layer of thick, pillowy muffling, which not only takes away the sharpness of the piano's attack, but also makes it sound alien and wombed in from the world. On the first piece, the loops dance around the stereo spectrum in a disorienting ballet; on the second, they build ever outward as more loops are added and echoed and set randomly against each other, creating heaving, oscillating waves of liquid piano. Basinski's liners refer to the process of setting the loops against each other and multiplying the sound as allowing the sounds to ""breed,"" and that's basically what they do. A short, melodic piano figure is the basis for each piece, and the breeding of the loops makes for moments of both startling beauty and dense, opaque numbness, much more the former than the latter. There's a terrible kind of sadness in these loops as they waver and repeat, clouding themselves over and generating swells of feedback-- the sepia piano tone and the choice of notes play like a hazy memory of loss. This is part of what separates Basinski from other minimalists and experimental composers. There's an obvious process, even a theory, operating in his work, but it never sounds scientific or cold-- the human element of emotion comes first and is multiplied by the process. As such, Basinski's work has the potential to appeal to many listeners who otherwise wouldn't care to listen to hours of slow, incrementally changing tape loops. And, of course, sometimes the slowness of the music itself can be all the justification needed for setting aside an hour to get outside of our up-to-the-minute existence and really, truly listen.",,7.7,

If anything, it's just as likely that you can put on this CD, listen to it, and not remember anything about it once it's finished. Even when paying close attention, it has a drunken dreamlike quality that can make even the firmest grip slip. Tara Jane O'Neil's songs are much like her singing voice-- understated, quiet but not timid, pretty but shaded with a wearying sadness. She sings the way people talk to themselves when asleep. These qualities work for and against her on this record. From the first moments of opening instrumental ""Take the Waking"", the tone is set-- pretty stretches of wordless singing collide with loud hesitant amplified guitars. When it works-- as on gorgeous lullabies like ""Without Push"" or ""The Poisoned Mine""-- O'Neil's plaintive whispers and words meld perfectly with the electro-acoustic backdrops. When things falter-- as on a rusting creaky track like ""Howl"" or the stumbling ""Love Song Long""-- the effect is less enchanting than disorienting and disconcerting. More successful is the rustic crawl of ""Known Perils"" and the insistent wet echoes of ""Famous Yellow Belly"". Interspersed between the actual songs are brief interludes running the gamut from shy and introspective (the electronic burbling of ""Tracer"") to pensive and ominous (the banjo-flecked ""I Call You""). Even on the less successful tracks, there are moments to savor, such as the off-center harmonies of ""Howl"", and the looped violins transformed into buzzing songbirds on ""Love Song Long"". It's a credit to O'Neil's skills that such moments of transparent studio manipulation actually help in establishing the provincial atmosphere of this album, a mood reinforced by repeating a melodic phrase from ""The Poisoned Mine"" in the final track. This mixture of technology and rustic elements gels into an organic whole, approximating the creak of a porch swing through relays and circuits. For those interested in getting a closer look at the stitches, you'll want to listen to Bones, a odds and ends collection released around the time of You Sound, Reflect. Given that Bones is a collection of disparate tracks, there is a interesting sense of cohesion, as if this is a more haphazard sibling to the unerring consistency of You Sound, Reflect. Conveniently enough, three of the better tracks from the parent album (""Without Push"", ""Famous Yellow Belly"", ""The Poisoned Mine"") are available in versions that don't differ much from their final state, excepting a lack of bells and whistles (and, in some cases, violin). Joining them are efforts that would seemingly slot in just fine on the official record, like the tremulous ""Highwire"" and the queasy ""Another Sunday Saint"". On the other end of the spectrum are out-of-character offerings such as a trip-hop re-engineering of ""Bullhorn Moon"" (a track from Tara's first album, Peregrine), and the drum-machine driven ""Enter This House"". For a woman that's on record singing, ""my desires put me to sleep"", Tara Jane O'Neil proves to be quite the restless spirit. Thankfully, these restless labors produce sumptuous fruit.","Indie scene veteran best-known for her work in Rodan, Retsin, and the Sonora Pine returns with two understated, plaintive albums.

Frusciane himself has copped to White Light/White Heat and Lust for Life being his inspiration here, but that's already apparent from the first track: ""What I Saw"" is all fuzzbox guitars, cavernous, minimal drums, and a snarling hard-rock melody, all of it pushed into the red. Emptiness is far more guitar-oriented than it's predecessors, Will to Death and Ataxia's Automatic Writing, and rocks harder and more consistently than any of his other solo releases. But for a guy whose previous solo work can be uncompromisingly experimental and usually miles away from the sound of RHCP, it's surprising that the best moments of this album are when Frusciante's simply a guitarist, and the best songs are reminiscent of Cailfornication. The fleet-fingered solo that closes ""What I Saw"", the psychedelic tones of ""Inside a Break"", the extended riffing of ""Look On"", and the feedback screech preceeding the chorus of ""Emptiness"" are the most memorable parts of otherwise unexceptional tunes, showing Frusciante's gift for impeccably appropriate guitar lines that swooped in and saved the day for the Chili Peppers not so long ago. That said, songs like ""Emptiness"" and ""The Worlds' Edge"" borrow heavily from the more melodic moments on Californication. It's one thing to be upfront about your influences, but to imitate them without adding something-- convincing vocals, unique lyrics, clever songwriting-- leaves these songs sounding unremarkable at best. Frusciante is so dedicated to classic production tone, his songwriting suffers. Any variation is welcome here, and that's what makes the double bass-drum battle cry of ""666"" and the calm falsetto of closer ""Scratches"" stand out so far from the rest. If this was to be Frusciante's take on hard rock, then it's unfortunate that there's none of his avant-garde spirit or experimentation to be found here, because a record like this sorely needs it.","This is the fourth of the six albums the Chili Peppers guitarist recorded in 2004 to see an official release.

The dinner jazz for a barbarian movie juxtaposed with swords slashing metal as heard in stage two of Strider engrosses me in a daze as much as how Autechre exploits my skull as a punching bag in their number, ""Surripere"". However, I could also blame most of my future health problems and failures to bearably socialize on the ungodly video game, if so many child shrinks and Senators Joseph Lieberman and Herb Kohl would tell me. If anything, there is no worse hangover than the one from playing a game like Advance Wars for 10 hours straight-- the eye strain, the purples and red visages burned into your retinas, and the impulse to run back and forth into a trance to resuscitate that buzz. Traces of such bygone anxiety and bliss awake whenever I hear Secede's remix of an Ilkae tune. Someone is first overheard playing a Nintendo Gameboy Advance game as its erratic rings and squelched ""power-up"" noises attest. A dazed department-store lobby Muzak organ then kicks in to lead a rousing techno-pop jaunt akin to a game's victory music when the planner beats a level. The melody remains faithful to video-game synthesizers, and it's simultaneously elating and queasy. On Ilkae's 2001 album, Pistachio Island, Canadian and Polish teenagers Aaron Munson and Krystian Lubiszewski wore their deficient attention spans and zest for what seemed like imaginary video game soundtracks on an IDM tip. The elements were all there in its 45 tracks: rhythms that could accelerate or die off in a moment, 8-bit synth melodies, and the nagging feeling that you should feel guilty for playing with children's toys. For Bovine Rearrangement, Pistachio gets remixed by Ilkae's brethren in the post-techno underground, namely from the Merck stable. The 19 results mostly score pointers for enhancing what were typically one to two minute sketches on the original album. No specific remixed tracks were named on the CD cover. Explicitly furthering the Nintendo vibe is Vim! who throws together an erratic medley of accurate Gameboy Advance-level jingles that seemingly change whenever the artist is bored with a level. Daedelus deepens Ilkae's melancholia with drifting organ drones and laundry dryer-like percussion. Even stronger are Machine Drum's fountainhead washed synths and broken hip-hop beats, and Octopus Inc.'s psychosomatic flashbacks. The rest of Bovine dwells in the music box fetish or downtempo meditations that drift with a head hanging down through the spotless, glass-domed megapolises that so much post-techno/armchair techno/IDM has indulged in for so many years. While it's not progress, these blues can still make losers feel like winners, however the natural light burns their eyes as they stagger out of the arcades.","Polish-Canadian teen electronic duo gets reinterpreted by a legion of post-techno remixers.

Hello Starling,Josh Ritter,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3175e6ef95969320583/1:1/w_160/ba2019b2.jpg,2005-02-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6939-hello-starling/,Signature SoundsSignature Sounds,"Rock criticism abhors a singer-songwriter. Unvarnished chords 'n' lyrics are like tax code to describe, and worse to read about. Disco-punk was interesting no matter how weak a given Radio 4 song might be, and anything psychedelic lends itself to late-night prose ego trippin' fueled by THC and past-date ephedra. Even recent Pitchfork singer-songwriting heroes boast an extra something: Iron & Wine's antebellum intimacy, M. Ward's California surrealism, freak-folk's freak-folk. Then there's Josh Ritter, who sings and writes songs with ultra-trad folk-rock arrangements and eschews the band-like stage names of hipster convention. Rooted in the Americana of Woody Guthrie and Townes Van Zandt, Ritter's songs stand naked, conjuring the landscape and musical vernacular of his native Northwest. Hello Starling is the Idaho troubadour's third album-- first for a non-folk label-- and it's past time Ritter received the treatment daily papers currently lavish on another flyover-state kid with a recently released record (or two). Yawn, right? OK, the songs: ""You Don't Make It Easy Babe"" makes Dylan comparisons easy babe with sprightly finger-picking, creaky railroad-over-a-Rocky-Mountain-pass vocals, wounded-lover wordplay, use of the word ""babe."" Full-band ""Snow Is Gone"" rejoices like Dylan's unjustly maligned New Morning, sharing its spring gospel even with the Hitchcockian starlings that shat on sidewalks all winter. ""Wings"" sets a panoramic narrative over soft arpeggios: ""I stole a mule from Anthony-- I helped Anne up upon it/ And we rode to Coeur d'Alene-- through Harrison and Wallace/ They were blasting out the tunnels-- making way for the light of learning/ When Jesus comes a'calling, she said, he's coming round the mountain on a train."" Ritter's prowess extends to rollicking rock 'n' roll self-immolation fables (""Man Burning""), heartland Nick Drake (""Bright Smile""), and whirling Wurlitzer valentines (""Kathleen""). Sure, I'd prefer organ tones less reminiscent of Dylan's son's band and more sonic experimentation-- the gentle late-period Yo La Tengo sprawl of ""Baby That's Not All"" is a good start-- but as a storyteller, Ritter is matched only by his lofty influences. For all that, Starling doesn't even include Ritter's best compositions, which can be found on Golden Age of Radio. That record's title track, usually a country-rock barnstormer, recurs as a ballad on the Starling reissue's four-song live bonus disc. There's still time to unearth earlier gems like ""Harrisburg"" and ""Me & Jiggs""; it took critical opinion years to coalesce behind Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits, too. Ritter again: ""Inside this gilded cage, a songbird always looks so plain.""","Reissue of this Idaho singer/songwriter's recent third album offers ultra-trad folk-rock arrangements and simple, straightforward delivery.

Take Fountain,The Wedding Present,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9e39d034d5c69bf3d2c/1:1/w_160/eb0acb0d.jpg,2005-02-14 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8600-take-fountain/,Manifesto,"David Gedge has given us at least two great albums: 1989's Bizarro and 1991's Seamonsters. The former is a barrage of cutting guitar jangle, with Gedge growling and beaming all over it. The latter is a grander, murkier, fiercer affair, wherein Gedge playacts all the bitterness, frustration, and sheer craven meanness of the jilted, dating male; it's catharsis and black comedy in one package. After those career peaks, Gedge and his Wedding Present released a string of reliably snappy records, and then he formed Cinerama. The difference between the Wedding Present and Cinerama is the difference between (a) getting drunk alone, calling your ex, hanging up on her new boyfriend, and breaking stuff, and (b) sipping a glass of merlot and gazing out at the park where the two of you picnicked. Cinerama is all adult pop classicism; suddenly the guy's bite is working around duets and string arrangements and 60s pop swing. And that's how things have been since roughly 1997. So when Gedge regroups the Wedding Present for this album, certain expectations are raised: Has our man gotten sick of being classy? Is he itching to play guitar too fast and growl again? The answer is: not really. Sure, this is more of a guitar record than anything Cinerama will ever make-- and some songs pull off noise-squall tricks running all the way back to Seamonsters. But Gedge has grown up, chilled out, and learned new chords; there's no point in turning back the clock. The band may be as in love as ever with the sound of their own amplifiers, but when it comes to songs, there's no changing course. The result is a lot like Elvis Costello's periodic returns to rock territory: snappy genre exercises from a reliable songwriter, but not much more. There are moments that seem rote. You get the sense that the guy could sit down and toss off one of these songs at any moment-- some nice riffs, some well-arranged chord changes, and everything he wishes he'd said to his last girlfriend. And there are moments when that charming adulthood seems a bit easy: There's a certain thrill to hearing a classy break-up number reminisce about ""the day we bought that weird pornography,"" but there's also a sense that Stephin Merritt has already beaten that horse dead. The good news, though, is that Gedge just gets better and better at casting himself as an upscale songwriter, even outside the ""sophisticated"" confines of Cinerama. Who, back in 1991, would have guessed that his clenched-teeth complaining-voice came along with such an expressive croon? Who'd have guessed that fierce crabby Gedge--like Costello before him--would ride pop classicism to such a comfortable place? It's an unglamorous, underrated role, but it fits him beautifully. And here, beneath the obligatory vintage-Weddoes guitar snap, that's what you'll find: our older, wiser Gedge, still endlessly negotiating with girls.","Indie pop legend and John Peel favorite David Gedge regroups his well-regarded Wedding Present combo, but doesn't return to their jangly roots, instead preferring the adult pop classicism of his other band, Cinerama.

Gangstabilly / Pizza Deliverance,Drive-By Truckers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb44abf31b7dc7155a55/1:1/w_160/cae9eec7.jpg,2005-02-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11721-gangstabilly-pizza-deliverance/,Soul DumpSoul Dump,"As the story goes, when asked how she could stand to live in Mississippi, Eudora Welty replied, simply, that it was her home. ""Such is the duality of the Southern thing,"" Patterson Hood claimed on the Drive-By Truckers' ambitious, career-making double album, Southern Rock Opera. Since its inception, the band has been exploring the pride and shame of being native to a region known for both its richly subversive art and its ingrained racism. That mission crystallized on Southern Rock Opera, which plumbed the mythology of George Wallace and Ronnie Van Zant, and the Truckers developed it further on their two subsequent albums, Decoration Day and The Dirty South. Before Hood and Mike Cooley (who formed the core of the Truckers until Jason Isbell expanded it) gave it a name, that duality informed their first two albums, Gangstabilly and Pizza Deliverance, both of which were originally released on Soul Dump but have long been out of print. New West Records has remastered and reissued them with new packaging and new liner notes by Hood (which are inexplicably dated February and October 2005, as if he's writing from the near future). Neither reissue contains any bonus tracks, which seems like a slight. However, both Gangstabilly and Pizza Deliverance retain their shape as albums, without any fans-only material to detract from climactic grandeur of ""Sandwiches for the Road"" and ""The Night G.G. Allin Came to Town"", respectively. As their titles suggest, these two albums are filled with humor, but despite a tracklist that includes ""The Living Bubba"", ""18 Wheels of Love"", and ""Too Much Sex (Too Little Jesus)"", these aren't yuk-and-pluck songs that satirize their white-trash subject matter. Hood and Cooley write story-songs about hard-luck losers, people at the end of their ropes, and they take their characters very seriously. They both realize that when people are at their lowest, any action, no matter how dire or self-deceiving, can appear logical. Cooley's ""Panties in Your Purse"" from Gangstabilly begins with a little backstage flirtation in the first verse before the second verse recounts the woman's sad situation: divorced, raising children, drinking excessively, living with her mother, working a dead-end job, going to shows for a precious bit of fun. On Hood's ""Bulldozers and Dirt"", which opens Pizza Deliverance, the narrator hits on his girlfriend's underage daughter, knowing all the while it's wrong but giving into his fixation all the same: ""something comes over me when you come near/so won't you come over and sip on this beer."" ""Margo and Harold"" contains enough grim humor and great lines for a Barry Hannah short story, as another Hood narrator confesses his fear of the couple of the title: ""Margo and Harold, feeling no pain, fifty and crazy, big hair and cocaine."" None of their stories would have much resonance, however, if the Drive-By Truckers didn't sound so raw and immediate. Revealing a band still refining their sound, Gangstabilly and Pizza Deliverance precede the Truckers' fascination with and mastery of 70s rock. There are excursions into Black Oak Arkansas and Lynyrd Skynyrd territory on ""One of These Days"" and ""Sandwiches for the Road"" but songs like ""Wife Beater"" and ""Box of Spiders"" have the unrehearsed casualness of country and alt-country, while ""The Tough Sell"" and ""Buttholeville"" experiment with heavy-riffing blues rock. Despite former Trucker Rob Malone's relatively quaint and characterless contributions and the obsolete joke of Hood's crass ""The President's Penis Is Missing"", these two albums are sturdy and solid. More than just blueprints for subsequent accomplishments, Gangstabilly and Pizza Deliverance are accomplishments themselves-- the beginning of the Truckers' long haul.","Southern rock revivalists show their roots with these new reissues of two of their late 90s efforts.

Silent Alarm,Bloc Party,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a466b1335d7bf1698955/1:1/w_160/bdbba4e4.jpg,2005-02-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1130-silent-alarm/,V2WichitaVice,"The English live on an island, have national radio, and they had the Smiths and the Stone Roses. As a result, they're less embarrassed than Americans to dream of indie guitar bands commanding decent audiences. That's part of what Bloc Party frontman Kele Okerere seems to have in mind when he describes this album as ""Technicolor."" He means it has big sound, big hooks, energetic performances, ambition-- all the things that make rock bands sound skilled and confident. He means no messing around, no interludes or experiments. He means the kind of guitar record where every song wants to be as tight as the singles; the kind that wants to be worth every penny any lawn-mowing pre-teen might spend on it. Because according to him, nobody makes that kind of record anymore. That isn't true-- and the last thing anyone wants is for U2 to try harder-- but he has a point; it's no accident that there are people who think Radiohead haven't really delivered since The Bends. Put it like that, and what Bloc Party actually sound like drops pretty low on the list of things you need to know about Silent Alarm. What perhaps matters most is that they're trying to make one of those clean, consistent, ambitious Popular Guitar Rock albums-- and depending on how much stock you put in that kind of thing, they've done a great job of it. This is a solid, intelligent album that a lot of people will love-- one that'll slot onto indie-crossover CD racks right beside the debuts from Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, and the Futureheads. Lead single ""Banquet"" is wonderfully tight and energetic-- the same kind of spiffy half-dancing rock as Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out"" or Duran Duran's ""Planet Earth"". That's easy to pull off when you've got a drummer this good, and a bassist that locks in with him so neatly, whether it's for rock charge or disco hustle. That, in fact, has been Bloc Party's main selling point, apart from the whole Remarkably Competent thing: When the rhythm section stretches its limbs, they leap a good distance away from the straight-ahead eighth-note riffing of the others in this game. Filter in their timely post-punk moves, Bunnymen gestures, and pop ambitions, and you start to feel like this is what it might have been like to listen to the Police or XTC in the early 80s; the sound of a straight-up rock band just a shade more sophisticated, and a little more interested in rhythm, than most of their peers. And of course the opener, ""Like Eating Glass"", is even grander and snappier than ""Banquet"", as if to promise from the start that these guys take your purchase seriously. The songwriting is simple in style (forward rhythm, tidy hooks, guitars) but smart in detail-- all stops and starts, bridges and breakdowns, firework flourishes and tasteful studio tweaks. Even more striking are the precision and sheer good taste of the performances: It's not so easy to show off within the confines of songs this focused, but these guys seem to manage just fine. So you get all the usual scrubbed-up gifts: the slower song, the slower song that turns into a faster one, the one with the studio effects, the one with the handclaps. A lot of this material is surprisingly scripted, as if someone spent whole nights in the practice space trying to get a two-bar guitar transition to work Just So. Okerere has a voice that's weirdly similar to the singer from the long-forgotten Adorable, with whom Bloc Party share a hell of a lot more than an appreciation for the Bunnymen: It's a vaguely-strangled back-of-throat thing that lets him moan and shout with refreshing gusto when the band gets going. (Typically ambitious topics of moaning: other people, culture war, girls and society and stuff.) The voice weakens a bit when he needs to croon, but crooning isn't really the point here. Bloc Party can be pretty, even sappy, but they're never looking to be atmospheric; they can rock, but they're never looking to whip up dark drama. This album charges happily down the center-- it shakes its hips now and then, and it whispers here and there, but it always seems to come back to tight and bouncy. People will love this record. And so, inevitably, the people who don't love it will start complaining. And when they complain, they'll point out that this is just a regular-old rock album, full of all the current stylish rock-album tricks. And they'll be absolutely right; at worst, Bloc Party are like one of those people who are so well-groomed that it's hard to remember exactly what they look like. But really, a complaint like that misses something: Being a good ol' unchallenging rock band is this outfit's whole point-- and their biggest strength. ","Building on the success of their early singles and EP, the UK's Bloc Party draw from the darker end of their homeland's 1980s indie pop canon to create a powerful debut LP. The silly bandname may bely their sober and resolute sound, but it's of little consequence in the shadow of this record's charismatic sophistication and outstanding songwriting that emphasizes substance-over-style, contrasting with their peers in Interpol and Franz Ferdinand.

Different Days,L'Altra,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc83eb335119a49ecca7/1:1/w_160/8a040e1d.jpg,2005-02-13 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4652-different-days/,Hefty,"L'Altra settle small tracts of land and make them feel large and lived-in. Their lap-pop micro landscapes are intricately detailed, beaming with uncharacteristic expansiveness in a genre that's often precious and diminutive. Different Days, the band's first album in three years, is verily a headphones record. No strangers to hard panning, L'Altra are cleanly and delicately mixed; on Different Days, Rhodes pianos, wobbly-legged guitars, and sluicing strings roam freely within seemingly infinite dreamspace. Listeners familiar with the Notwist, Ms. John Soda, and Psapp are likely to hear strains of those bands, as well as more ambient, texture-oriented groups likes Hood and Bark Psychosis. But unlike Hood, who prefer a consolidated, unified approach, L'Altra are more inscrutable. Their songs are heavily fragmented, stitching together melody from seemingly arbitrary sources. And, hailing from Chicago, they're above all less European; L'Altra may rely on computers, but Different Days aches with a punchy midwestern twang, from the power line-shaded prairie captured on the album's cover to the tremolo-juiced guitars and bucolic strings contained within. Curiously, Amazon.com suggests pairing Different Days with Keren Ann's sensational 2003 album, Not Going Anywhere. Aesthetically, the albums have little in common other than spindly female vocal. But like Keren Ann, L'Altra make music that's almost too soft to matter, with an alluring, slightly sexual pull. Their songs burst open upon inspection; you must first shrink to their size, but once you do, you'll probably want to stick around for awhile. Opener ""Sleepless Night"" starts with a chorus of ringing telephones-- chopped, muted, and processed-- and slowly incorporates acoustic elements as it wiggles into focus. ""It Follows Me Around"", an easy standout, is more immediate: The track opens with an alighting guitar loop, pinioned by ringing bell tones, and blossoms early, reserving only a grandiloquent post-breakdown crescendo. By and large, the album avoids glitch-kitsch, preferring a more natural form of fracture. When the title track opens with a chopped breathy beat, it's quickly reinforced by unobstructed vocals and Rhodes piano. Different Days is notable for its consistency; a collection of primarily lovelorn ballads, each song flickers with detail while retaining many common characteristics. Polymath Lindsay Anderson (she's collaborated with Telefon Tel Aviv, Slicker, and Will Oldham) and Joseph Costa divvy up the vocal sheet, seldom locking in harmony. On ""So Surprise"", however, they join together, rendering an a cappella chorus-- ""If you leave, right back to me/ Like every man, you don't matter/ To every man you don't matter""-- poignant through its implicit gender ironies. And though Different Days is full of sodden slow jams, L'Altra aren't entirely incapable of levity: Closing instrumental ""A Day Between"" packs its suitcase and steals away on a beam of hope, capping this weighty collection with a pounding new-new-wave beat that would make even Braxe and Falke blush.","Latecomers to the late-90s Chicago scene abandon their turtle-necked post-rock for intricately detailed lap-pop.

The Earth Is Blue,Damon & Naomi,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89713d19756521396b0/1:1/w_160/bcc31c57.jpg,2005-02-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2159-the-earth-is-blue/,20,"Since the demise of their seminal trio Galaxie 500, Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang have rather quietly cut a broad and illustrious path through the subterranean cultural underbrush, complementing their musical activities with a variety of creative projects in addition to running their astonishing publishing company, Exact Change, through which they've issued works by such writers as Franz Kafka, Alfred Jarry, and Antonin Artaud. And now with The Earth Is Blue, released on their new 20/20/20 imprint, they can also scratch ""start record label"" off their shrinking to-do list, and their timing couldn't be better. Thanks to the recent explosion of variously mutating forms of psych-folk, the duo's literate, atmospheric music is sounding more prescient than ever, and they operate at top form on this, their first album of new material in five years. Damon and Naomi have always had the spot-on taste, working with such first-rate collaborators as Dean Wareham in Galaxie 500, Wayne Rogers in the short-lived combo Magic Hour, and acid-folk pioneer Tom Rapp. These partnerships have often seemed unduly crucial to the success of their music, since their technical limitations as vocalists (both have gentle, unassuming voices that qualify more as pretty than powerful) and players have sometimes made their purely duo work seem constrained and repetitive. Particularly fruitful has been the pair's recent coalition with the members of Japanese psych leviathan Ghost, beginning with the ambitious, elegiac Damon and Naomi With Ghost. Although that 2000 album contained several peaks of sublime grace, there were also points where Ghost's expansive arrangements had an unbalanced, grafted-on quality, likely due to the fact that the musicians were composing their ideas on two separate continents. On The Earth Is Blue, however, Ghost guitarist Michio Kurihara appears as a virtual third group member, and his impeccable electric guitar contributions are here fully integrated into the immovable foundation of Damon and Naomi's earthy, intimate folk, creating the most satisfying and sheerly transfixing work of the twosome's career. Also helping to fill out these songs are trumpeter Greg Kelley and saxophonist Bhob Rainey, and it's their effusive playing that allows tracks like the opening ""Beautiful Close Double"" or the evocative ""Malibran"" to truly achieve liftoff. Throughout the album Kurihara's playing is the model of tasteful restraint, best illustrated by his subtle, jazzy riffing on Naomi's wistfully sung cover of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", an invitation for overwrought fretboard histrionics if ever there was one. Instead, he contents himself by laying back in the wildflowers, examining every note carefully as though it were an exotic leaf in his hands, such as on utterly gorgeous coda of the title track which closes the album with a worldly, passionate whisper. As Naomi sings on the perfectly crafted Mellow Candle-like folk-rock of ""Sometimes"", ""Not everything need be in doubt. Sometimes the right thing comes along.""","Ex-Galaxie 500 members are, as usual, literate and atmospheric on their first album in five years.

The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick,John Fahey,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1e13d197565213b48d/1:1/w_160/e9e416d9.jpg,2005-02-13 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2947-the-great-santa-barbara-oil-slick/,Water,"John Fahey is a tough nut to crack. What was his deal? How did people relate to his music during his heyday? In the 60s he was a ""folky,"" sorta, but read his funny and weird liner notes from those records and he seems cut from a different cloth. Fahey later crossed paths with pianist George Winston (producing Winston's first album for his Takoma label) and and Windham Hill founder William Ackerman, and thus came dangerously close to being branded New Age. His best-selling record (and the only way most people would know his name) was a Christmas album. Then in the 90s we knew him through his Drag City association, working backwards from Jim O'Rourke's Bad Timing to see where it all started, and Fahey was canonized the patron saint of avant-garde folk. With all the new weird stuff from the past couple of years, he casts a longer shadow than ever. It took me a long time to warm to the man's music. Years before I actually heard him, I would notice him being mentioned by other musicians, usually acoustic guitarists driving the road Fahey paved. In my mind Fahey developed an aura as a musician's musician, the dude with the chops and the idiosyncratic style that needed years of training to appreciate. Once I started becoming familiar with his records, the icy ""musician's music"" layer that had kept me from fully appreciating what he was doing began to thaw, and I began to understand the towering strength of his compositions. The songwriting hooked me. Fahey was hitting on all cylinders throughout the 60s, stuffing great songs into more than a dozen albums. This prime era is well represented on this CD of previously unreleased live recordings, pulled from two shows in 1968 and 1969. It's only his third official live album, and the first from the 60s, so obviously The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick is an important release. Glenn Jones of Cul de Sac oversaw the preparation of the old tapes for release and contributes witty and personal liner notes, and the sharp packaging is a suitably tactile experience in honor of the man who founded the Revenant label. Nothing is ever quite what it seems in Fahey's songs. ""Requiem for Mississippi John Hurt"" finds the pivot point between country blues and bluegrass, moving between a light, bouncing verse and sheets of furious picking on the chorus that manage to evoke both the hills of Kentucky and 20th Century minimalism. The stately ""When the Catfish are in Bloom"" sounds about 200 years old and parts of it probably are, as references to marching spirituals slowly pile up into a ringing cluster of notes. The slow opening of ""In Christ There is No East or West"" shows how easily melodic Fahey could be when so inclined, and ""The Death of the Clayton Peacock,"" with its graceful slide notes hanging in the air like long curls of smoke, is pure atmosphere. With its strong selection of songs and impressive fidelity, The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick is a worthy summary of where Fahey was at this high point. Musicians complain that critics like to pigeonhole. We're always straining to ""stick you into a box"" by scene, sound, or genre, summing up a life's passion in a single turn of phrase. Is it a fair complaint? Possibly. It's sort of an OCD thing, where we slip into thinking of music as a field of discrete categories, and expect artists to come to rest in their allotted slot (the record collection as coin sorting machine). It's normally a subconscious process, but it happens. There are exceptions, though, these initially puzzling artists that demand a more determined approach and, not coincidentally, rarely grow tiresome. Guys like John Fahey.","The massively influential guitarist's third live album collects previously unreleased recordings culled from two shows in 1968 and 1969.

With the Concretes, Eriksson's guitar and Haapalainen's production helped build tracks reminiscent of a coupling between the Velvet Underground and the Ronettes. By the sound of Heikki, Ronnie Bennett musta been Lee Hazlewood's baby on the side. Heikki's second full-length-- the first released in the U.S. by Magic Marker-- adds the twang of Hazlewood's mid-60s productions and looser, more improvisational arrangements to the Concretes' stylized indie pop. Eriksson's vocals are more Neko Case than Nancy Sinatra, and sound only a little like Concretes singer Victoria Bergman's winningly weak-nosed Nico. Together with Haapalainen's primarily acoustic guitar and a smattering of melodica, Heikki somehow end up sounding like a rougher Aislers Set. Opener ""Former Hero"" hula-hoops through sticky Oklahoma summers as shown in a Scandinavian cinema, cleverly adding extra beats beneath the word ""exaggerate"" and sumptuous girl-group harmonies drawing apart over the words ""again and again and again and again."" Stiff-lipped ""Election Day"" kisses an old friend farewell, then ""Still You Don't Know Me"" dramatically confronts a familiar stranger who, like Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo, sees in the narrator only someone else he once knew. The best song, ""Give It Back to You"", revels in close female harmonies as it triumphantly rejects another unfeeling lover. Still, these songs often fall short of similarly inclined efforts by groups like Camera Obscura. The lyrics often dwell too long in the realm of pop cliché (""all this time you kept it all inside""), which works better in the in-quotes music of The Concretes, where tracks like ""You Can't Hurry Love"" are both referential and satisfyingly irreverent. Covers of ""Nothing Lasts"" by overlooked 60s folkie Karen Beth and 80s Australian folk-pop group The Triffids' ""Tender Is the Night (The Long Fidelity)"" are somewhat draggy bonus tracks.

Run the Road,Various Artists,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82e9d034d5c69bf399c/1:1/w_160/c373f718.jpg,2005-02-11 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2058-run-the-road/,679,"When Dizzee Rascal's ""I Luv U"" first leaked to the internet, it was accompanied by the rumor that it was made with an iBook and a cheapie pencil microphone. A ridiculous visual in retrospect-- iLife in Bow E3!-- but it's interesting that someone somewhere thought it made more sense to tight-focus on Rascal's tools rather than his environment. His environment, after all, was the real story; first in the parentless, concrete battleground that he narrated to lucid detail on Boy In Da Corner and later, in the incredible roster of talent that turned out to be lurking just off Dizzee's camera all along. Part of the reason Boy In Da Corner sounded so immediate was because you could sense the friction of Dizzee's story rubbing up against the as-yet-untold stories of those around him. In his lone voice, he always sounded defensive, like someone who'd broken away from the pack and might have to spend the rest of his life running from it. ""MCs better start chattin' about what's really happening,"" he spat on ""Brand New Day"", ""Because if you ain't chattin' about what's happening, then where you living, what you talking about?"" That was Dizzee's dare to grime: exist. Now, 18 months later there's Kano, Terror Danjah, Goodz, Target, D Double E, Lady Sovereign-- it's hard to imagine that grime's viability was ever in question. In fact, as a genre, grime has probably never felt as exciting, vibrant, and promising as it does right now. Its surprising malleability has made it possible for producers to splinter off and pursue different strains-- some adorn their tracks with East Oriental timbres and scales; others go for frosty, brittle sounds; others prefer homemade noises with anxious, scattershot qualities. Sonically, it seems like no idea is too strange right now, just as long as it's fresh. It doesn't hurt that hunger is woven into grime's DNA, either-- a competitive bloodflow only guarantees movement. And yet, for all of that, I can't say I'm surprised that the only grime to register with the record-buying mainstream so far has been Rascal's. Yeah, Wiley's record was slept-on, but Shystie's was a dog, and the jury's still out on a half-dozen full-lengths yet to come. Grime needs confrontation and a mix of personalities to properly assert itself-- it lends perfectly to the compilation format. And yet, underground mix tapes excepted, there hasn't been a single decent comp until now. Luckily, Run the Road is so fucking good that none of that really matters. A collection of ""greatest hits,"" some of which are close to a year old, it should rightfully become the de facto entry point for anyone with even a passing interest in this music. Not only does it provide a sweeping survey of the genre's biggest figures, it strikes to the heart of grime's maneuverability by constantly changing gears without ever sounding anything less than massive. It is also full of more wonderful single moments than you would reasonably expect from an ensemble cast. There's a new sound, a new voice, and a new idea at every turn-- I can't remember the last time a compilation had me this excited for a genre. Hunger is the glue here. Despite the varying production aesthetics and emceeing styles, nearly everything on Run the Road sounds in danger of burning through the speakers. Frantic opener ""Cock Back (v1.2)"" has Terror Danjah, Riko, Bruza, D Double E, and Hyper getting rowdy over plink-plinks and an emptying clip; Roll Deep gushes Oriental synths out its slashed-open stomach on ""Let It Out""; Kano gets streetwise and skittery on the reptilian ""P's and Q's""; remixer Terror Danjah turns the ""Cleaning Out My Closet""-soundalike of Shystie's ""One Wish"" into a universe-swallowing epic. Imagine a single voice toppling a chorus of screams, and then another voice shouting down that racket, and then another-- that's the net effect. I have no idea whether this is going to have the impact that it should. It's certainly too ""British"" to slot in with American hip-hop, but it was a pipedream to think that this incarnation of grime ever could. The sad truth is that I can easily envision a scenario where this does absolutely nothing, short of maybe sneaking into a few record stores through the back door. If that's the way things play out, fine, whatever, I give up. At least it'll be the most incredible failure I've ever heard. ","Out on 679 now and Vice next month, the invaluable grime primer Run the Road provides a sweeping survey of the genre's biggest figures and strikes to the heart of its maneuverability by constantly changing gears without ever sounding anything less than massive.

Winnipeg Is a Frozen Shithole,Venetian Snares,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94013d197565213982b/1:1/w_160/974adce5.jpg,2005-02-10 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8444-winnipeg-is-a-frozen-shithole/,Sublight,"Whenever I try to go to sleep by my computer's light, I flinch in phantom pain. Let me show you my scars. For nearly 17 months, I went to bed to the unison of clickity-clacks and PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOD-THUNK-SNAP-SNAP-PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOM. My college roommate at San Francisco State enjoyed the after-hours pastime of updating his stock market report to the strains of gabber techno wrecking his PC's tiny speakers beat by beat. Now gabber is typically acclaimed as the ""metal"" of electronica with its gas-huffed, buzzsaw synths and jackhammered, acid-bass beats that don't so much thud as purr. Snippets of trash culture-- from Marilyn Manson bragging about being stranded on an island made of cocaine sand and marijuana forests to video game-esque threats of violence-- often serve as garnish. The noise could soundtrack 'ole-timey, escapist abandon for a good five minutes, but when someone loops the same damn rhythms over and over for months on end, it digs a fingernail into your soul and tears inch by inch. Plus, listening to drum machines cranked at 300 beats-per-minute can numb the senses into sheer boredom. Perhaps my roommate was responsible for my brief bouts of sleepwalking. Now, here comes Aaron Funk. This lad from Winnipeg is a fine swordsman on the breakcore tip, often improving the formula of dandy, music-box harmonies razor-slashed with beats that shatter in 12,000 pieces when blown upon. This prankster releases what seems like a dozen records a years, but it can get a bit much when he leaves it to you to clean his mess. He's delivered some memorable gimmicks-- especially Nymphomatriarch, a self-titled collaboration with Hecate on which they sample their own mating sounds. It's one of the most detached, asexual, and alien pieces of dance music ever. Winnipeg Is a Frozen Shithole is witty by name only. The EP's song titles are various declarations of revolt ballpoint-penned on 7th grade desks, (ex. ""Winnipeg Is a Dogshit Dildo"", ""Die Winnipeg Die Die Die Fuckers Die""). Nothing much is said about the Canadian hamlet other than fragments of folks telling how cold and dreary it is, like a newsclip telling of a high school coach accused of sexually assaulting a student. Yet, wishing your hometown would burn in a blue corner of Hell is a rite for many fellas who are never, never, never understood. The music is almost straight-up gabber, which is great for purists but a chore for others. PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOD-THUNK-SNAP-SNAP-PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOM is the general rhythm here. ""Winnipeg Is Steven Stapleton's Armpit"" thankfully breaks the monotony with a couple mindlessly ribbeting the syllables in the word, Winnipeg. Fanny's remix of ""Winnipeg Is a Boiling Pot of Cranberries"" also sticks out for its beats that almost slip from Funk's hands. The most remarkable sample stems from the title track, on which Isabella Rossellini coos, ""Listen to the sounds of Winnipeg"" and ""If you are sad and like beer...I am your lady."" Both lines are sampled from a great fever dream of celluloid, The Saddest Music in the World. But it's difficult to think of Rossellini, her hand cupped under your jaw, and her proposition amidst the PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOD-THUNK-SNAP-SNAP-PHOOM-PHOOM PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOD-THUNK-SNAP-SNAP","Gabber techno is the death of Winnipeg.

I Am Kloot,I Am Kloot,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a313d197565213aecf/1:1/w_160/8ab02620.jpg,2005-02-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4159-i-am-kloot/,Echo,"Judging by I Am Kloot's lyrics, I'm guessing only three objects exist in frontman John Bramwell's daily sphere-- the pub, his apartment, and the rural scenery between those two places. Of course, some unattainable love interest haunts him at each of these locations, but for the most part Bramwell's lyrical scope remains incredibly narrow. With that in mind, I Am Kloot are a three-piece Mancunian outfit unsure if they want to be the next Blur or the next Keane. For every clever or cynical piece of songwriting on their debut Natural History, there was an equally unappealing moment of staleness. On their self-titled second album-- released 18 months ago in their native England-- I Am Kloot take baby steps to reduce this ratio and distinguish themselves from the rest of Britain's rock fodder. To be fair, I Am Kloot will never actually become Keane. Bramwell's nasally voice is too biting to pull off sappy sing-along anthems, and he wisely avoids them here. Additionally, the band exhibits significant instrumental growth compared to the monotonous debut. Opener ""Untitled #1"" shows off Andy Hargreaves' savvy drumming while on ""Life in a Day"", the album's standout track, Peter Jobson's smug bassline charges Bramwell's otherwise dejected tone. However, while the band is smart enough to avoid egregious indie rock pitfalls, the album still suffers from a lack of ingenuity. Bramwell uses the pub/apartment/pastoral trifecta ad nauseam, as demonstrated by this I Am Kloot lyrics mash-up I have prepared: ""Loneliness...it drinks but never leaves ('3 Feet Tall')/ You stand like a rock, on top of the mountain ('Cuckoo')/ Swell, we're living in a hotel ('Proof')/ You say you're like a tree or a bus stop ('Untitled #1')"". Although the songs generally steer clear of predictability, Bramwell's melodies are limited by his narrow singing range. As a result, most of the hooks fall flat, which isn't a total loss considering who would actually want the phrase ""you say you're like a tree or a bus stop"" stuck in his head. Fortunately, Bramwell's bandmates do a decent job of covering his snarky ass on most songs, though stripped-down ballads like ""Proof"" and ""Not a Reasonable Man"" still expose him as an unattractive, hungover malcontent. I Am Kloot comb over their weaknesses, avoiding the schmaltz that eventually doomed bands like Athlete and Badly Drawn Boy, but barely differentiating themselves from them in the process.","I Am Kloot's second LP gets its U.S. release-- 18 months after it was issued in the UK.

Horn of Plenty,Grizzly Bear,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c013abf31b7dc71563df/1:1/w_160/2cb22f8b.jpg,2005-02-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3666-horn-of-plenty/,Kanine,"Considering their name, Brooklyn address, and penchant for lo-fi campfire serenades, there's a powerful temptation to put Grizzly Bear in the same pen as those other charismatic megafauna, the Animal Collective, and be finished zookeeping for the night. But Horn of Plenty proves that categorization would be neither fair nor accurate. The gentlemen of Grizzly Bear paw around in wholly distinct regions of gentle, nocturnal psych-folk, conjuring visions of an imagined bedroom collaboration between the Doug Yule-era Velvet Underground, Nick Drake, and a pajama-clad Pooh with his head jammed in a honey jar. Originally conceived by multi-talented singer-songwriter Edward Droste as solo demos, the recordings that became Horn of Plenty were later augmented by the additional vocals and instrumentation of Christopher Bear, and after hearing the off-handed cohesion of the duo's dreamy harmonies and their seemingly effortless musical interplay it's difficult to imagine these songs achieving such heights of hushed majesty in any other format. And the extra set of hands ensures the flow of enough fresh oxygen to allow the album to avoid complete descent into the troubled, myopic solitude of such similarly toned homespun constructions as Skip Spence's Oar or Syd Barrett's The Madcap Laughs. The album opens with the appropriately submerged sounds of ""Deep Sea Diver"", which gradually climbs through currents of chiming, bell-like keys and guitars before finally surfacing into golden falsetto rays of sunlight. ""Disappearing Act"" marries its autumnal folk choruses to gauzy smears of vinyl hiss, handbells, and remote martial snares, while the clattering pocket symphony of ""Showcase"" eventually dissolves into the wordless vocalizing of felines on distant fire escapes. On nearly every track a previously unheard element, such as the mournful violin that shivers up the spine of ""Eavesdropping"", makes a brief spectral appearance before once again vanishing, leaving the listener to wonder at what hidden treasures further scrutiny might unearth. Given the heady depth of Horn of Plenty's hazy musical swoon, Grizzly Bear's lyrics somewhat surprisingly strike a pleasant counterbalance by residing more often than not in the familiar realm of day-to-day reality. It's not unusual to hear Droste and Bear singing relatively mundane pronouncements like ""My chest hurts a lot tonight"" or ""It's amazing I can still sing this song so simply about you,"" with such matter-of-fact nonchalance that as a result these songs collectively sound as unforced and natural as a series of quiet exhalations, capable of transferring the beguiling, intoxicating atmospheres of Grizzly Bear's bedroom directly into your own.","Brooklyn band sings lo-fi campfire serenades and gentle, nocturnal pysch-folk.

A Healthy Distrust,Sage Francis,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1aea9e61561daa7846/1:1/w_160/abaaeda9.gif,2005-02-10 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3181-a-healthy-distrust/,Epitaph,"It doesn't require a particularly puritanical moral stance to balk at some of the misogyny, homophobia, and bloodlust that are rampant in music culture, and particularly in mainstream rap, where these values have found their most fertile and overt purchase. This is not a new idea, regardless of whether you view the trend as toxic or innocuous. Possibly the last interesting facet of this phenomenon is how people with staunchly progressive politics and who countenance no hate speech in their everyday lives can switch these precepts off like a faucet when confronted with the hypnotic strains of the latest 50 Cent single. Maybe we're too postmodern to apprehend values so contrary to the ones we profess as anything but satirical cultural criticism. Or maybe we've just been lulled into compliance, taught that the small voice of the conscience is the priggish influence of Tipper Gore, to be suppressed and disregarded. In our neoconservative political environment, all dissent is treason. Rap eerily echoes this conservatism; all dissent is player-hating. Talib Kweli was onto this years ago: ""Reverse psychology got 'em scared to say when shit is whack/ Out of fear of being called a hater, imagine that!"" Sage Francis can be truthfully called a lot of not-necessarily-nice things: Self-absorbed, condescending, solipsistic, and heavy handed. But he could never be accused of docility. Francis never mastered the shoulder shrug that's become so natural a defense mechanism for many of us; his stockpile of moral outrage is limitless, and whether you agree with his renunciation of mainstream rap as repetitive, poisonous filler (on ""Dance Monkey"": ""She likes the repetitive songs that keep playin'/ You know the repetitive songs that keep playin'?"") or think he's a self-aggrandizing prick, it's fascinating to observe how strangely he rubs against the culture, turning its own weapons against it and criticizing its assumptions. On A Healthy Distrust, Francis continues to refine his contradictory blend of trash talk and activism, political polemic and introspection, pedantic bluster and profound insecurity. He's always emphasized substance above style: If you have something to say, you say it, even if it means losing the beat for a minute. But here his style has finally caught up with his intellect, and while his beats are passable but unexceptional, his voice locks onto and scans over them so ferociously they're almost obliterated. He's a Bizzarro-world Eminem, his voice low instead of high; using his ramifying metaphors and serpentine rhyming schemes to decry cultural decline instead of celebrating it. Ever the realist, Francis doesn't seem to hold any hope of closing these wounds, political or personal--his invective is depressive and irate, imbued with a sense of determined futility. ""The Buzz Kill"", erupting with antsy strings and explosive drums, laments the decadence and celebrity-worship of rap culture. ""Sea Lion"", all skittering drums and hypnotic melody, is equally pessimistic about the prospects of healing childhood injuries: ""Ma, look what I did to my hands, I broke 'em/ You gave me the stone, gave me the chisel, didn't say how to hold them"". And ""Gunz Yo"" is strikingly brave, taking on rap's firearm fetish with all of the stridency of what it attacks. Fire with fire. ""Gunz Yo"" isn't a plea for non-violence, it's a bald-faced threat. ""It might remind you of a mic the way I hold it to the grill of a homophobic rapper/ Unaware of the graphic nature of phallic symbols/ Tragically ironic, sucking off each others gats and pistols"". This isn't the first time Francis has overtly spoken out against homophobia, and it's lines like this-- and his classic turn from Non-Prophets's Hope, ""I attended candlelight vigils for Matthew Shepard while you put out another 'fuck you faggot' record""-- that best exemplify the bipolar, counterintuitive nature of his style. Of course, I don't think Sage Francis is going to make anyone change their minds or behavior, and he doesn't seem to think so either. But he expresses an especially distinct, heartfelt worldview, and serves as a galvanic reminder to reevaluate your politics and morals on a personal level. The vast majority of hip-hop isn't harmful or hurtful, but that doesn't mean we should open wide for whatever they want to shove down our gullets. Amid such adverse circumstances of unclear implication, a bit of distrust seems healthy indeed.","Francis continues to refine his contradictory blend of trash talk and activism, political polemic and introspection, pedantic bluster and profound insecurity.

I Am a Bird Now,Antony and the Johnsons,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b6ea9e61561daa487c/1:1/w_160/87971d9e.jpg,2005-02-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/467-i-am-a-bird-now/,Secretly Canadian,"The 1974 photo of Andy Warhol superstar Candy Darling on the cover of Antony and the Johnsons' second full length, I Am a Bird Now, is the perfect complement to the ghostly hymnals that flit and sigh behind its black and white shadows. A melancholy but arrestingly beautiful image, it depicts Darling on her deathbed; bright flowers float behind her upturned arm like a cluster of soft, pale moons radiating light onto the bleached sea of sheets in which she's drowning. Besides being a tight aesthetic move, the image also links Antony to the early fabulousness of downtown New York, reminding the informed viewer not only of Darling's too-early death from leukemia, but the AIDS-related passing of the photographer himself, Peter Hujar in 1987 (the same year Warhol died, following routine gall bladder surgery). Klaus Nomi was already buried by then, and the Downtown scene was getting too close to saying goodbye to Cookie Mueller, Keith Haring, David Wojnarowicz, and Antony's sometime doppelganger Leigh Bowery (the subject of Boy George's musical Taboo), among others-- all victims of the AIDS virus. This visual meditation on death and radical history smoothly conjures the family tree upon which pale, angelic Antony perches. The vocalist/pianist moved from California to NYC after seeing the documentary Mondo New York, lured by the 1980s cabaret scene it depicted. Quite fittingly, his first performance came with a musical troupe called Blacklips at the famed Downtown venue, the Pyramid. Jump now to 2003, when Antony opened for Lou Reed and sang the Velvet Underground classic ""Candy Says"" (yes, for Candy Darling) as an encore after most performances. Knowing all of this-- the very important history in that cover-- helps to understand the melancholy, sense of loss, and rapturous joy in these 10 tracks. But however aesthetically intriguing and complex that history may be, the ultimate draw is Antony's voice, and within the first two seconds of the album, it should be very clear to even the most unaware newbies that Antony has an amazing Nina Simone/Brian Ferry/Jimmy Scott vibrato, a multi-octave siren that would sound painfully lovely no matter what he was saying. Lucky for us, he fills that promise with worthy syllables. The greatness of this downcast crooner is the melding of that otherworldly trill with a dark, powerful aesthetic. Looking past his sad eye make-up and kewpie-doll features are these mesmerizing songs about loving dead boys, plaintive letters from hermaphroditic children, the fear of dark lonesome purgatories, breast amputation, the fluidity of gender. The first words of ""Hope There's Someone"" and of the album ""Hope there's someone who'll take care of me/ When I die"" feel more lonesome than just about anything and then there's the rapturous promise of ""For Today I Am A Boy""' that ""One day I'll grow up and be a beautiful woman/ One day I'll grow up and be a beautiful girl"". I Am a Bird Now's majesty didn't come easily: Antony's self-titled debut was released five years ago on David Tibet's Durtro label, but only now has he found the perfect mix between style and substance. More stripped down than earlier offerings-- most of the focus is on piano and voice, although violin, viola, cello, sax, and flute are also heard-- there's no missing Antony's thoughtful words. There are a number of guest vocal spots-- Devendra Banhart (gypsy incantations in the beginning of ""Spiralling""), Boy George (""You Are My Sister""), Rufus Wainwright (""What Can I Do?""). All of these powerful singers are overshadowed by Antony's angelic chops, though Boy George ends up turning in a surprisingly moving performance. His duet with Antony explores private memory, brotherhood/sisterhood (regardless of gender), relationships, empowerment (""I was so afraid of the night/ You seem to move to places/ That I feared""), and wish fulfillment. (Really, grab the hankies.) For his part, longtime Antony fan/champion Lou Reed does a little spoken ""I was lying in my bed last night"" intro and some chunky guitar chords on the doo-wop horn swagger of standout ""Fistful of Love"", which works itself up to a frothy Otis Redding devotional to love's bruises and the comfort of a familiar fist: ""I accept and I collect the memories of your devotion on my body"". The mingling of friends is a treat but, heart in his hand, Antony can more than ably go it alone-- even though he spends so much of I Am A Bird Now fearing solitude and celebrating those rare perfect connections. Then again, in this carefully laid out record, the final track, ""Bird Gurl"", leads quite dramatically to full-fledged climax as our hero searches for and finds wings, finally taking a solo flight. Contrast this with the pathos of the opener's fear of falling asleep and that ""middle place"" between light/life and darkness/death. Of course, when the album begins again, so does the reality of perhaps having nobody to hold an aching dying head. But then, so does Antony's riveting trip towards his airborne epiphany. And on the cover, Candy's flowers remain in bloom. ",,8.6,
Do the Bambi,Stereo Total,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55dc0084474cd0c06d8/1:1/w_160/b88d2cc1.jpg,2005-02-09 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7491-do-the-bambi/,Kill Rock Stars,"There are two situations in which you'll say a band is your favorite. The first is when someone asks, and you think about it, and you say something boring and realistic like the Clash. The other is when the music is actually playing, live or recorded, and it just comes out: This is the greatest thing ever. At their best, Stereo Total are that second type of band. Writing about this duo makes them sound complicated-- part synth kitsch, part garage band, part Gainsbourg/Bardot revivalists-- but the truth is that most everything they write is simple enough for the two of them to play on their own. The music's like a cross between a thrift shop and the Apple store: Just a jumble of ""amateurish"" pop-song trinkets, stylish cast-offs, and entertaining gadgets. They're like Saint Etienne, except French and German and funny and horny and trapped in your garage with a case of cheap beer and a shitty drum kit. Do the Bambi is their sixth full-length, and it's as much a turning point as a drop-off in quality. Toy with anything-goes aesthetics for long enough and you're going to develop some ambition. That's what you hear on this one: a slinkier, more sophisticated duo, one that makes little motions out into complexity instead of coasting on sheer verve. Over the course of 19 tracks, results are maddeningly mixed. This album, even more than their others, is like a cheap pinata: A lot of candies come out, and a few of them are bound to be stale yellowish things that don't taste like butterscotch. The treats, though, are fascinating. ""Babystrich"" has Brezel Göring singing noir falsetto disco that nudges toward Scissor Sisters territory; ""Hungry!"" goes back to FraxE7oise Cactus for the old pop charge, an addictive chipmunk hook, and a lyric that conflates hunger and loneliness (extra points for ""me so hungry""). And it's there, around the center of the album, that some of the old verve returns-- like on the terrific ""Tas de Tôle"", which gets together some of the cut-and-paste ""dance music"" euphoria of their last few records. So more slink, less chirpy pop; decent highs and throw-away lows. There are surely 15 minutes of Terrific in here, and maybe 30 of Okay, all capped off by an acidic synth-and-vocal cover of ""Chelsea Girls"". Nothing to get excited about, but they just might be inching their way someplace interesting-- Stereo Total less as stylish curiosities and more as contenders.","Mid-90s Dutch indie rockers' second attempted comeback.

Horus,The Impossible Shapes,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95c13d197565213ae2e/1:1/w_160/5fcbdeb5.jpg,2005-02-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4087-horus/,Secretly Canadian,"The Impossible Shapes have been a kind of Rorschach test for critics; their previous albums have been likened to everyone from Syd Barrett to Small Faces, Stephen Malkmus to Robert Pollard. Comparisons to the Elephant 6 Collective were apt not only because of the Shapes' psychedelic influences but because they were equally prolific: In addition to several IS albums (they released two full-lengths in 2003 alone), Peter King and primary songwriters Chris Barth and Aaron Deer have released solo projects, and three members of the Shapes moonlight in the band John Wilkes Booze. On Horus, they're still indebted to sounds of the 1960s (sounding less ""lo-fi"" here than ever), both in their British folk-influenced melodies and psychedelic textures. But compared to their previous work, Horus is tighter and more focused, and the songs are static in tone rather than the dynamic shifts that fans may expect. The whimsy of their previous efforts has been flattened in favor of a consistent, melancholy mood. The album isn't necessarily dark, though its lyrics might suggest otherwise. When not singing about demons and princesses, Chris Barth grounds the fantasy elements of his lyrics with heavy thoughts of loneliness. You can hear it in ""Putrefaction"", featuring lines like ""You will drown down below/ While ever onward I roll"" and ""Now go off on your own/ I feel better alone/ I turn seaweed to stone/ I make music alone."" But the words sound lighter on record than they do on paper thanks to Barth's boyish delivery. ""Forever Alone"" even sounds oddly triumphant, with a horn section backing the chorus of ""I am alone/ Tonight and forever."" The pair of ""Demon"" songs are the most memorable tracks. ""Demon Child"" sets the bar early, moving from warm organ tones into one of the record's few rock riffs. ""Demon Love"", on the other hand, is the lone curveball of the record: It begins as a prodding dirge, but when in the chorus swells with a choir of backing vocals, it's the closest to real despair the album gets-- but it's also its most gorgeous moment. The melodies take time to grow, but the brevity and unresolved air of these songs make many of them feel like fragments. I hate to sound foreboding, but the record that Horus most reminds me of is Pavement's Terror Twilight. It's a worthwhile record with some minor peaks, but I hope the band finds their way out from under Horus's grey cloud.","The latest release from Secretly Canadian's prolific 60s fetishists.

Triple Your Work Force,Four Volts,by: Stephen M.

After two 7"" singles, the loss of their original drummer, and a call from the lawyers, they reconvened under the less-imaginative-- albeit less litigious-- Four Volts. As befits a band who found inspiration in a Muppet, Four Volts sound extremely spirited, sometimes goofy, and occasionally hilarious. On their full-length debut, Triple Your Work Force, they play pop songs in the punk manner: loud, brash, and often sloppy, closer to the wildness of Animal than the scientist's bumbling nerdiness. That doesn't make them unique, but their relentless energy and sense of fun serve them much better than an undue emphasis on innovation. Triple Your Work Force displays the band's penchant for rowdy verses and big choruses: ""Didn't You Used to Be Invisible?"" kicks the album off with a pogoing beat closer to Big Audio Dynamite than the Clash. ""Rearranged"" is their frenetic explosion of 70s New York punk. ""Mary Said"" is a rousing anthem for bored newlyweds. The insanely catchy ""Heartworm (Ooh Ooh Song)"" contrasts Danny Tieman's increasingly manic delivery with an urgent guitar, handclaps, and Lisa Cuomo's harmonizing ooh oohs. Four Volts play up this contrast between abrasive lead vocals and calmer, almost cooing backing vocals, which enlivens ""Bedlam on the Beat"" and adds hefty tension to ""She Muddied the Water"". Songs like ""Andy Likes His Gravy"" and ""I'm Not a Psyche-o-Path"" (16 seconds of insistently chanting the title) prove that Four Volts aren't afraid of silliness in pursuit of searing lyrics and catchy choruses, but they pull a fast one and turn their gaze shoeward on late-in-the-album songs like ""Hat Trick"" and ""Sunday Night"". The songs aren't bad, just relatively dull, and they trade punchy and raw for Deep and Meaningful, ending the album on a self-serious note. Had those tracks been interspersed throughout the album, they perhaps wouldn't seem like genre exercises aping currently fashionable influences, a sour move for a band whose specialty is combustible spontaneity. On the other hand, this proclivity toward range-expanding experimentation helps Four Volts live up to their previous name.","This Long Island quartet are loud, brash, often sloppy, and occasionally hilarious.

Joji,The Anomoanon,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0adb1335d7bf169808c/1:1/w_160/6eaba113.jpg,2005-02-09 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/205-joji/,Temporary Residence,"Imagine clawing through an overgrown vegetable garden by moonlight, mud pushing up under your fingernails, dandelions displaced, soil shooting everywhere, a haphazard mound of earthworms, pebbles, and bits of grass rising high into the night, while tiny streams of sweat snake down the back of your dirt-flaked neck. It's here that the Anomoanon's Joji seems destined to be found, burrowed out from the wet earth, caked in clay, beloved by ants. There's something unsettlingly familiar about Joji, the Anomoanon's seventh full-length-- it might be because the six-piece resuscitates and revises a variety of classic rock gestures, or because their sound is so oddly, eerily organic, or because vocalist/guitarist Ned Oldham's high, throaty, Kentucky-born warble can sound disconcertingly similar to younger brother Will's. But mostly, it's how Joji sounds like above-ground pools and paper cups full of lemonade, like fireflies in mayonnaise jars and rusty sprinklers, country cottages and snap peas: it's Americana without the pre-packaged kitsch-- all ground and sky and precious American ritual. Joji sounds like a record made by mountains. For the most part, Joji eschews the light, snappy melodies and traditional lyrics of its predecessor, The Derby Ram, in favor of woodsy, instantly addictive country-folk dirges. Given Oldham and guitarist Aram Stith's fondness for scrappy electric solos, it's not particularly surprising that the Anomoanon are routinely compared to On the Beach-era Neil Young and/or the Grateful Dead circa American Beauty-- but keyboardist Dave Heumann's psych-infused squiggles lend Joji a dark, celestial swagger that's more Floydian than anything else (see, especially, mesmerizing opener ""Down and Brown""). Joji has its share of folkier moments, too-- the instrumental ""After Than Before"" features 12-string noodling, puttering bass, and minimal percussion, while the plucky, Stith-penned ""Green Sea"" is singalong-ready, anchored around a honky guitar melody, six-man harmonizing, and Oldham's shrugging vocals (""Your socks and shoes are filled with sand/ Your heart is beating for another man""). Joji confidently follows its own ebbs and flows, and, consequently, can occasionally feel a bit jammy-- but before you conjure drum circles, handmade pants, and Birkenstock clogs, know that the Anomoanon are always, always purposeful about their wankery, and some of the extended instrumentation included here (see the excellent ""Wedding Song"", which flits, over the course of its 10 staggering minutes, from waltz to 4/4 and back to waltz) is genuinely impressive. Joji may periodically flirt with gothic undertones, but it ultimately plays like a warm, comforting slice of deep American rock-- recognizable and exciting all at once.","Will Oldham's brother Ned offers Americana without the pre-packaged kitsch.

School of the Flower,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42fea9e61561daa4e47/1:1/w_160/22f2fc76.jpg,2005-02-09 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7203-school-of-the-flower/,Drag City,"A contemporary master of midnight ragas, acoustic noise, and finger-picking polysyllables, Ben Chasny doesn't snag as many magazine covers as Devendra Banhart, but there's no doubt the Oakland guitarist is an equally compelling-- albeit more taciturn personality. For starters, Chasny overlaps his Six Organs of Admittance moniker's Buddhist origins with paganism, astral projections, prophetic dreams, surrealism, and a reverence for outsider folk masters. Then, of course, there's his day job as a psych monster in Comets on Fire, his craggy partnership with Deerhoof co-founder Rob Fisk in backwoods experimenters Badgerlore, a touring/recording relationship with Current 93's David Tibet, and a brief European tour with Joanna Newsom this April. As lazy as it is to pin Banhart to one specific scene or motif, Chasny proves even more difficult to jam within the confines of the ""New Weird America"" tag. It's like pigeonholing John Fahey's ghost. Now add to all of that an obvious knowledge and love of Southern Lord metal/drone and early 1990s noise. Unlike those who list Vashti Bunyan and Harry Smith as forebears, Chasny cites Ghost, Dead C, Keiji Haino, the Japanese noise label PSF Records, and the vastly underrated contemporary avant guitarist Loren Conners. In the same breath, he talks about the importance of complimenting your Incredible String Band forays with Fushitsusha, Sunn 0))), the radio on white noise, and Skullflower. So while there's no doubt he works within a folk tradition on some level, instead of tagging Chasny with the full-on f-word, it makes more sense to link him with Supreme Dicks or Tower Recordings or other acoustic-minded experimenters. Either way, Chasny's incredibly prolific by any standard. In 2004, his Six Organs ouput alone included For Octavio Paz-- a shadowy collection of mostly instrumental steel and nylon guitar pieces (with lovely bells and chimes)-- along with the reissues of 2000's Manifestation and 1999's Nightly Trembling. The year before he turned Nikki Sudden with Compathia and his self-titled 1998 debut received the reissue treatment. As Lou Barlow once taught by example, being so prolific can present a dud-heavy obstacle course, but thus far Chasny's yet to lay an overcooked egg. Better yet, his newest foray (the first for Drag City) is his strongest, most satisfying effort to date. Though his past home-recorded output never felt thin, School of the Flower is his first recorded in a studio (gone is the borrowed cassette 4-track) and the result is a dense, more three-dimensional sound. It's also his most tightly composed effort, a Zen balance between Compathia's lullabies, For Octavio Paz's melancholy six-string intricacies, and Dark Noontide's drifting, fractured downer psych universe. If you haven't heard Six Organs yet, this is where to start. The album begins with the raucous ""Eighth Cognition"", wherein Sunburned Hand of the Man/Cold Bleak Heat drummer Chris Corsano does what he does best, sluicing up an elegant dust storm part tornado/part precision rap. The churning, cymbal crash lasts for a little over a minute before suddenly dissipating and blending into the fragile ""All You've Left"", one of Chasny's gorgeous falsetto ballads. Taking the whirlpool of ""Eighth Cognition"" whirlpool a bit further, the 13-and-a-half-minute title track is a guitar/drum meltdown Chasny says was inspired by John Cale and Terry Riley's seminal 1971 collaboration, Church of Anthrax. On it, Chasny's guitar turns into an infinite loop under which Corsano's free to blow to and fro. Inititating a different sense of motion, ""Saint Cloud"" drifts patiently along Chasny's soft chants and dense ""Ohm""'s, some sort of droning, increasingly spiraled feedback, and crisp repetitious strings. The spare ""Words For Two"" and ""Home"" (the later with a star-kiss, Loren Connors-style guitar launch) are Chasny's tightest, most affecting vocal-and-guitar pieces to come gliding 'round the holy mountain. There's also a thoughtful cover of Gary Higgins' folk classic, ""Thicker Than a Smokey"" from the 1973 album, Red Hash, which was recorded briefly before he went to prison on a two-year, nine-month sentence for possession of marijuana. Chasny's take perhaps lacks the distant small-town melancholia of the original, but when he sings its haunting opening-- ""What do you intend to do young man? Where do you intend to go?""-- there are still chills. Chasny has often covered it live and decided to ""throw it on the record to put the word out so we could find Gary Higgins."" In fact, Zach Cowie at Drag City started writing all the Gary Higgins' he could find and eventually located the red-haired folkie, who just signed a contract with Drag City to reissue his lost 1973 masterpiece. (Like the best records, School of the Flower's legacy extends beyond just its songs.) As intimated earlier, School of the Flower blooms and dies rather quickly. Put more prosaically, the whole thing runs its course in just under 40 minutes. This might seem like a minimalist shame for amped-up drone junkies, but really it's a tasteful (and very very welcome) gesture. More practically speaking, when Chasny reaches the final jangling sustain of the guitar coda lullaby ""Lisbon,"" he still hasn't made a misstep or tapped a wrong note, so who can blame him for achieving something so sublime and not wanting to fuck it up? Whatever its duration, School of the Flower is one of those rare, understated but compulsive collections you'll want to listen to on repeat until it's time to blow out the incense, dump the wine in the sink, and step fuzzy-headed into the imperfect sunlight of the prosaic, but suddenly potentially transcendent world. ","Wedding the experimental free-folk of ""New Weird America"" to the more conventionally song-focused SF freak-folk movement, Six Organs of Admittance mastermind Ben Chasny comes into his own on this, his first-ever studio-recorded LP. Richly textured and three-dimensional, School of the Flower straddles the line between moody ambient madness and vintage sunlit psych-folk.

Attagirl,Bettie Serveert,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28d9d034d5c69bf2c11/1:1/w_160/8b7e54cb.jpg,2005-02-08 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/676-attagirl/,Minty Fresh,"Aging rockers, here are your late-career tricks: There is the sensitive, café singer/songwriter, the awkward electronica dabbler, the mellow lounge act, and-- of course-- the thirty-something band attempting to rock like the energetic college-radio stars they once were. After their 1992 breakout album Palomine, Bettie Serveert's popularity steadily declined, necessitating these career moves on 2003's frustrating Log 22. Attagirl, the band's sixth full-length, doesn't buck the trend as Bettie Serveert try to convince listeners-- and apparently themselves-- that these tropes are proof of some sort of musical development. Never the most controversial or cynical songwriters, here vocalist Carol van Dyk and guitarist Peter Visser fully embrace the conservatism of adulthood and domesticity. Most of Bettie Serveert's material is written and recorded in Visser's cozy living room studio, and his once-mighty axe now sticks strictly to background noise and texture. Despite kicking off ""Greyhound Song"" with a Physical Graffiti-inspired slide riff, Visser plays slave to van Dyk's vocals and remains surprisingly inconspicuous. Instead, rudimentary sampling, piano, and acoustic guitar back Van Dyk's notoriously slight lyrics, as on the title track: ""Don't say luck/ Is somewhere in the middle/ You've paid for your place in this world/ Attagirl."" On yawn yawn yawns ""Don't Touch That Dial!"" and ""Hands Off"", the band hopelessly goes after their Palomine-era intensity, like a thirtysomething woman trying to squeeze into her prom dress. Even sadder is the act-of-desperation cover of Bright Eyes' ""Lover I Don't Have To Love"". Former Matador labelmates of Pavement and Yo La Tengo shouldn't have to rely on the popularity of Bright Eyes to attract listeners, yet what is one to do when they've lost their edge? Suddenly, I understand why my father, an old rocker, used to sing along to rap songs in the car.","Mid-90s Dutch indie rockers' second attempted comeback.

Headshots: Se7en,Atmosphere,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13813d1975652138596/1:1/w_160/d8327a83.jpg,2005-02-08 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/343-headshots-se7en/,Rhymesayers,"Somewhere in my closet-- under stacks of candid spooning snapshots and problematic collage valentines-- is a muddy, gurgling mixtape from an ex-girlfriend. It's a dub of a dub given to her by the boyfriend pre-me who got it from a trollop he dated for a minute who stole it from a kid she made out with in some car that wasn't his. Where the owner of that car got it is, I'm sure, quite fascinating, and somehow the backseat genealogy leads to a 4-track in Minneapolis. By the time the tape got to me, it sounded like a dude with a mouthful of toilet paper rhyming over trunk-beats of passing cars-- but that shit was ill, son! From what I gather, that tape was cobbled bits of Atmosphere's original Headshots mixes. I'm not going to bullshit and say that I listened to it until my cassette deck jammed, nor did I pass it on like a mild burning sensation to my next ladyfriend. Nope, I dumped it in a box along with the hope of ever loving again, and the sad, lascivious story of that little tape came to an end. Rhymesayers obviously had this fate in mind when they decided to remaster the final installment of Atmosphere's Headshots mixtapes along with a bonus disc of highlights from Volumes 1-6. Originally released in the interim between the group's debut LP, Overcast!, and its successor, Lucy Ford, Headshots: Se7en is little more than a vaguely interesting document of Slug's progression from shit-talker (""Tracksmart"") to hip-hop's Conor Oberst (""The Abusing of the Rib""). Recent efforts were praised for the introspective, self-deprecating lyrical spin, although the Native Tongues did it better ten years previous. Shit, Biz Markie is the king of emo-rap! Always willing to turn a verbose phrase, Slug undermines his cleverness with what appears to be an unfortunate case of Van Horton's Syndrome. His inability to modulate the volume or pitch of his voice by any noticeable degree makes sitting through the entire 21 songs, not to mention the additional 10 tracks on the bonus disc, feel a tad bit tedious. Guest spots from a young Eyedea, Musab, and Gene Poole don't add much to the party, though Eyedea's track, ""The Stick Up"", should erase any notions that Slug respects women. Ant's production is slightly impressive considering his tools, but I'm not convinced he would have used any additional tracks had they been available. He only seems hampered on a few tracks and does an admirable job of mixing things up, but somebody needs to hook dude up with a new drum machine. After two hours of his choppy snare scraping my eardrums, I'm ready for some Enya on quiet storm. For rabid Atmosphere completists, the lure of Headshots: Se7en is either the improvement in sound quality over the old cassette recordings or the fulfillment of a dream. Like Red Sox fans and Democrats, getting what you wish for can be confusing though, resulting in temporary loss of identity. All of the sudden, that eBay bidwar with the Korean kid seems like a waste of time. Here it is, the golden chalice, all polished up and ready to behold. But you didn't really want it. It was the hunt. You were the Indy Jones of file-sharing. Now what? Headshots is a generous treat from a label and artist to his committed fans; as such, it is a worthwhile release. For those who collect other things like TV memorabilia, it will be a hard sell to put funds from my, I mean, their Seth And Summer Savings towards a gift that was meant for someone else.","Rhymesayers digitally issues this extremely limited Atmosphere cassette, adding a second disc with highlights from Headshots, Vol. 1-6.

Hurry Up and Wait,Hezekiah,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c16ceb335119a49ed56a/1:1/w_160/82840990.gif,2005-02-08 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3999-hurry-up-and-wait/,Soulspazm,"Delaware is America's most active and profound state, no? The answer is no. Oddly, for a state that signed the Declaration of Independence even before reading it, it must have waited to pick all of its official state ""things"" after everyone else had their turn. Delaware's state bird is the blue hen. And their state marine animal is the horseshoe crab. State soil? Greenwich loam. (Port silt was already taken I guess.) The state beverage? Wait for it...it's milk. But if Delaware statesmen put up nominations for state emcee, Hezekiah has to be on the ballot. The First State native son has played the backdrop for the likes of Musiq and Bilal, in addition to catalyzing the producers' open forum, the Beat Society. And although I've never met him, I bet he's got one of those neckbeards the kids are clamoring for, as well as a lot of knit hats. Hezekiah released this album's lead single, ""Gypsy Slang"", back in 2003, so Hurry Up and Wait is an appropriate title for his proper career jump-off. Drawing heavily from the Philadelphia hip-hop sound creeping across the Delaware River, Hezekiah adheres to a strict diet of hi-hat/snare combinations and chest-rattling bass that cover his missteps as an emcee. (""How you gonna bust with an umbrella up your in butt opening up?"") ""Right On"", for example, pulls straight from the Time-Life hip-hop collection circa 1998 with a propulsive soul clatter that mimics a keyboard courting the bass drum. But without a watermarked sound, Hezekiah only builds on the backs of others. At this point, the baby Jay Dee comparisons are obvious and tracks like ""You"", with its bass-pause-clap staccato, would fit nicely somewhere in Slum Vil's Fantastic collection. Of course, Hezekiah also inherited Detroit's juvenile and utterly uncreative approach to female relations. (I think there are Cliffs Notes on romantic subtlety from Zalman King that never made it Hezekiah's home studio.) Demonstration? See ""Photograph"". ""She half nude, exposin' her fallopian tubes."" Pretty sexy, eh? After all, nothing says I love you like ""Put 'em on the glass/ Lemme take a photograph."" Despite its lightly veiled homages and patent immaturity, Hurry Up and Wait is a solid debut. And I can honestly say it's the best hip-hop album from Delaware in the past decade.","Delaware's finest MC finally releases his first LP, almost two years after issuing its lead single.

Anarchy In Paris! / Tokio Airport,Metal UrbainMetal Boys,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c54313d197565213bf8e/1:1/w_160/ca633548.gif,2005-02-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11785-anarchy-in-paris-tokio-airport/,Acute,"Anarchy In Paris! is a 24-track oversight correction, a collection of recordings from ""criminally neglected"" French punk-era group Metal Urbain, or so the liner notes would want you to believe: ""[O]ne would think that [Metal Urbain]'s groundbreaking drum-machine assault, shouted vocals (in French what's more!), distorted crash-and-burn guitars, metronomic noise clicks, and their claim to fame as the first act to release a record on Rough Trade would guarantee them some hallowed place in Punk Rock history."" Indeed, the groups mentioned as sonic antecedents of Urbain's music-- most notably the Jesus & Mary Chain and Big Black-- make the oft-abused claim of wrongful neglect justifiable in this instance. And then you realize what probably kept Metal Urbain from getting the same reverential treatment of their hallowed peers or their recently-exhumed brethren are probably the very things that attracted folks like the Reid Bros. & Steve Albini to their work: Their groundbreaking (as in pulverizing) drum-machine assault, their distorted crash-and-burn guitars, the metronomic noise clicks, and their shouted vocals (in French, as the group didn't set up enough obstacles between themselves and any potential English-speaking fans). Listening to Anarchy In Paris! in short bursts, the coulda-been-a-contender gnashing is intermittently justified. ""Panik"" (the A-side to the aforementioned Rough Trade single) constructs a primitive and monstrous wall of fuzz, and pelts the wall with a drum machine, some synth splatter, and cavernous martial barks. Even if the nuance of the message is lost in translation, the back-and-forth shouts of ""Panik!"" coupled with the incendiary guitar solo at the halfway mark make clear the group's intent. Unfortunately, most of the remaining 23 tracks feature minor variations and refinements on this Wall Of Industrialized Sound, turning the bulk of this album into indistinguishable mush. While some wrinkles in the formula emerge-- ""Pop Poubelle"" features some surf-guitar, ""Lady Coca Cola"" is Metal Urbain sans drums-- they're blanded out after the TommyRamonatron is triggered and the vocalist gets the bit removed from his mouth. It takes until Track 19, the Kentucky-fried ""Colt 45"", for some real variety to spice up Metal Urbain's cuisine, and that's mostly courtesy of a minor tweak in guitar tone and a singing style that shies away from the usual Cookie Monsterisms. The next track, ""Train"", is even more of a screwball-- it's blues standard ""Train Kept A-Rollin'"" done with drum machine and guitar. The trick here is that the drum machine keeps perfect time-- after all, it is a machine-- while the guitar and vocals decide to derail themselves every so often. The friction between the oblivious drum track and the stumbling meat turns out to be charming. Following that there are two slabs of mechanized heavy breathing (""Sweet Marilyn"" and ""Little Girl of Love""), a tango-not-tango, and an instrumental reprise of ""Panik"" that takes a Sunday drive on Gary Numan's Autobahn, but chances are most folk will get bogged down by the murky middle section of this disc and never get to the goodies at the end. For those looking for a little more variation in their neglected French new-wave retrospectives, try Tokio Airport, a 19-track Metal Boys compendium. The Metal Boys features two parts Metal Urbain (Eric Débris and Charlie Hurbier) and one part English-speaking Nico clone (China). It's on these tracks that Anarchy In Paris!' flights of fancy soar. For one, the group's learned how to program their drum machine to do more than play poom-tish at different speeds, which allows for excursions into bossanova (""He's Shaken Up"") and stray cat strutting (""Parlez Moi D'Argent""), in addition to the expected sci-fi damage. Also, China proves to be a flexible vocalist. She's willing to do the pop robot on bip boppy tracks like ""Be Bop Dee Zee Pop"", ""Wah Lee Bomp Dee Bomp"", and the less onomatopoetic ""Discount Bill"", but China's equally at home playing such disparate roles as the Strangelovian porn star (in ""Suspenders in the Park""-- feel free to quote either ""Fuck my ass in World War III"" or ""Napalm, you're so good in bed"" in your valedictorian speech) and the semi-detached quotidian raconteur (in the oddly affecting ""X-Mas Day""). Of course, since the Metal Urbain disc ended on a high note, the Metal Boys disc backs into the finish line, ending with 21 minutes of dubby warbling (""Un Petit Peu D'Amour""), repetitive oscillations (""Disco Future""), and some unseemly middle ground between these two poles (""Outer Space""). But, then, these discs are meant to be historical documents, not succinct statements of intent. As such, they might not guarantee Metal Urbain a notable place in music history, but it's not as if Metal Urbain is ready for carbon-dating just yet, either. Twenty-four years after breaking up, they've reunited, and are in the process of recording a new album while simultaneously looking for a label to release this record.

"Mutant Disco, Vol. 3: Garage Sale",Various Artists,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80f9d034d5c69bf3952/1:1/w_160/78adecf3.jpg,2005-02-07 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2030-mutant-disco-vol-3-garage-sale/,ZE,"Peter Shapiro provided more questions than answers when he attempted to explain the genre tag ""mutant disco"" in the February 2003 issue of The Wire. His piece detailed how during the 70s and early 80s, assorted misfits, art students, and punks concocted an alien disco music, yet his umbrella did not quite shade his honorable mentions, which were as scattered as Smokey Robinson, Public Image Ltd., Material, and James White and the Blacks. There is an argument that a scientific theory is meaningless if it cannot be explained to a 10-year-old. As for ""mutant disco,"" well...let's just consider it disco or a trace of disco that is more likely to halt the dancefloor than continue narcotizing it. The recently resurrected ZE label first cut its teeth releasing examples of ""mutant disco"" on its 1981 comp of the same name. Perhaps because of Shapiro's piece, ZE reissued and doubled the size of Mutant Disco: A Subtle Discolation of the Norm in 2003. Now the label issues Volume 3: Garage Sale, a supposed shoebox of Reagan-era snapshots from when disco evolved into ""garage"" or the beginnings of house music on the turntables of DJ Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York. While ZE's connection with mutant disco and house is rather forced, I just have to ask this question: Where has Junie Morrison been all my life? He planted one of the most vivid images in my mind with his 1983 electro-funk tune sold in the Garage Sale, ""Techno-Freqs"". The Funkadelic vet seemingly hosts a lunchtime performance for a teen science-fair; pondering video game addiction with a broken tape-loop machine and a robot that parrots idiot-box catchphrases. ""Are we man or machine? We have to make the choice tonight/ (Insert the robot sidekick): 'I pity the fool who doesn't make the choice tonight!'/ Remember how to freak and everything will be alright,"" goes a few verses carefully crooned as to not upset each face in the front row. This is camp as a reason for living-- no matter how many friends, co-workers, and clergymen laugh at you. However, Don Armando's ""I'm an Indian, Too"" troubles me. His Broadway-disco number, complete with a full orchestra backing, is up there with Cher's ""Half Breed""-- the legacy of indigenous America bastardized into the Star's egotistical grace. But then again, one cannot take a song too seriously that demands choreography and a diva who tells you with a hand on hip, ""I am Chipo-WA, Iro-QWA, Omo-HA, like those Indians, well I'm an Indian too!"" You get the idea. Another curiosity is Daisy Chain's after-school special rock, ""No Time to Stop Believing in Love"", which delivers raps in Spanish and Japanese to vaguely suicidal adolescents in assembly. Detroit's great Was (Not Was) delivers an oddly melancholic, open-shirted, and jeri-curled disco number, ""Dance or Die"", and an idea that ceases to be clever after about five seconds, ""Read My Lips""-- a Contempo Casuals house tune with Caesar I's wondrous promise, broken even after swearing on the King James version of the Bible. More faithful to the gospel and its blessings upon man is Suicide's ""Dream Baby Dream"", where frontman Alan Vega prays in tongues over wheatlands swaying in keyboardist Martin Rev's organs. Vega fares worse in August ""Kid Creole"" Darnell's remix of ""Outlaw"", a rockabilly jaunt that goes nowhere. Larry Levan's fingerprints on Kid Creole & the Coconuts' ""Something Wrong in Paradise"" are stronger, exploding a Latin-funk block party into a million colors. Most of Garage Sale seems to be novelties more than anything else. While that essence is the comp's selling point, it could unfortunately lead many to believe that mutant disco itself is nothing more.","A third Mutant Disco comp from the vaults of ZE Records.

La Merde et Les Etoiles,Gena Rowlands Band,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c012c0084474cd0c312c/1:1/w_160/2d846326.jpg,2005-02-07 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3665-la-merde-et-les-etoiles/,AutoclaveLujo,"On American Music Club's 1994 album San Francisco, Mark Eitzel declared that ""the world is held together by the wind that blows through Gena Rowlands' hair."" Rowlands, an accomplished actress, has never been an especially big star, but she's developed something of a cult fanbase for her work in TV drama and films-- particularly those of her late husband, John Cassavetes. Washington, D.C.'s Bob Massey apparently thinks highly enough of Rowlands to name his latest band after her, and it makes sense I suppose. The former Telegraph Melts member has pointed his latest project's arrows at Hollywood and the way movies cause us to perceive the world and our place in it, and choosing the name of an actress who often worked resolutely outside of Hollywood conventions lines up pretty well with his lyrical swipes at Eisner and Spielberg. And the mood of the album also bears more than a passing affinity for American Music Club's tear-in-beeriest moments, so that Eitzel quote isn't up there for nothing. La Merde et Les Etoiles (French for ""Shit and the Stars"", if I read it correctly) is so unified a work of brooding ghost cabaret miserablism you could practically call it a concept album, though the term is a little strong for a record with no overarching narrative. The music could qualify as chamber pop if it had any pretense of wanting to be pop-- instead the violas, vibes, clarinets, and cellos drift along behind Massey's wine-stained baritone, forming a sort of stream-of-consciousness backdrop that drifts in and out of dissonance, occasionally dissolving to a minimalist wisp. In fact, on a few songs in the middle of the record, the minimalism and lack of solid structure is a bit overbearing. ""Pilot for a Situation Tragedy"" is cleverly titled, but the arrhythmic electric guitar strumming and barely there accompaniment just die without anywhere to go, and the song dies with them. Much better is closer ""Power, Lies, Helena's Lips"", one of the few tracks with an actual drum beat. The arrangement is no more solid than anywhere else, though, so the effect is one of chaotic elements being stuffed in a box and escaping again, like a Lucy skit for insomniac depressives. Elsewhere, Massey appropriates the melody of the national anthem for a break-up meditation and wraps the album up with ""The Last Words of Lesley Gore"", an excellent song that plays again with barely structured chamber-pop texture, featuring a great breakdown where he slips into a dejected take on Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"", morphing it into a startling one-sided conversation about a girl.

Blessed Black Wings,High on Fire,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0deea9e61561daa7cb3/1:1/w_160/0c16a7f5.jpg,2005-02-07 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3864-blessed-black-wings/,Relapse,"On paper, Steve Albini's production style is the exact antithesis of what you'd want for your metal opus: big dank drumz and shrill, almost choked guitars, all gussied up in superfluous reverb and an air-tight low end. I've never listened to an Albini-produced band and not thought my ears were clogged. Sure, the man's 'nuff-said production credits go on and on, but I often wonder if a band like Mclusky would sound even more punishing if they were left out in the open, free of the silo 'verb and guitar strangulation. Still, Albini remains the preferred penis pump of underground rock acts of all stripes. He's on the speed dials of bands looking to get huge in that other sense. High on Fire already own one of the burliest sounds in metal, so what they were hoping to gain by phoning Albini isn't clear. The two seem an unlikely marriage anyway: High of Fire unleash a competent fury that thrives on warm-ish, tube amp'd guitars, and mainlined adrenal essence-- a far cry from Albini's balled-fist, hyper-compressed sludge treatments. 2002's Surrounded By Thieves was a tight-wound stoned-dead masterpiece; if the band were aching for change, they sure didn't play like it. High on Fire fans rejoice: Blessed Black Wings is the band you know and fear. Albini's influence is discreet, serving only to calcify the band's laser-cut attack. My only complaint with the sound is that Matt Pike's vocals-- more tuneful and comprehensible than the genre protocol-- are mixed down, so only the most glottal elements seep through. But perched atop Albini's distended low end, High on Fire are as toothy as they are flesh-searing. Previously, the band's raw energy was trapped in a self-imposed oubliette of standard gloom-n-doom; on Blessed Black Wings, they've busted out, terrorizing the masses with a sharper, more agile sound that will appeal to fans of Mastodon's Leviathan. But unlike Mastodon or prog-metal clairvoyants Converge, High on Fire don't seem the slightest bit preoccupied with the future; they're content to do what they do best as long as there are subtle unexplored pockets of terrain to be squatted on. Blessed Black Wings catapults full-throttle from the gate and scorches at 11 for nearly an hour, halting only for the occasional full-band kick. Avoiding polyrhythmic arabesques, High on Fire are almost antigravity: Their energy seems like it could last forever. Opener ""Devilution"" (now there's a subtle pun) splits the earth and stitches it back together, sending tom-bashing tremors through a landscape of bilious chugging and Voice of God vocals. ""The Face of Oblivion"" is less incendiary but no smaller, steering through a slow sooty opening before turning around in a smooth, economical breakdown that's grandiose sans bravado. Other highlights include ""To Cross the Bridge""-- a seven-minute epic that does the acoustic/electric guitar duel better than Converge or erstwhile Metallica by combining traits of both-- and ""Anointing of Seer"", whose gelatinous plunder gives way to a resplendent, fleeting riff around the 2:30 mark. Up in the elevated mercury of these six- and seven-minute sculptures, things can get muggy, but in terms of shear bombast, Albini has seldom worked with a more independently powerful group of musicians.","Metal giants team with Steve Albini on their latest Relapse album.

Yr Atal Genhedlaeth,Gruff Rhys,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a316ea9e61561daa4bd6/1:1/w_160/a18be8e3.jpg,2005-02-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6938-yr-atal-genhedlaeth/,Rough TradePlacid Casual,"A cell phone bleeped during Gruff Rhys' recent one-off show in New York City. Nothing fancy: just three pre-polyphonic chirps, like a car alarm arming. Rhys, rather than castigate the hapless technology victim, merely quipped: ""That's a good song!"" Such is the aesthetic of the Super Furry Animals' self-deprecating chief prankster, a grinning Wonka for absurdist pop candy and whiz-bang noise-making. The title track to Yr Atal Genhedlaeth (an untranslatable p-p-pun that means ""The Stuttering Generation"") is just nine seconds that, y'know, stutter as if to teach iPod Nation how scratched CDs used to sound. From there follow 10 songs about the Euro, rival MCs who drown their Corn Flakes in beer, and a dying lover endearingly nicknamed ""Pwdin Wy"", which means ""Egg Pudding"". All that, and it's less psychedelic than your average Super Furries' album, emphasizing songcraft and melody, and framed by Rhys' upside-down left-handed Velcro-enhanced acoustic guitar and thriftstore Yamaha beats. De facto opener ""Gwyn Mi Wn"" eschews even the guitar, opting for airy overlapped vocals atop clanging cymbal 'n' drum samples. ""Ni Yw Y Byd"" flips through keys like your humble rock scribbler through Ffa Coffi Pawb 12-inches he can't pay for, yet remains sing-songy enough for its title (trans., ""We Are the World""). Those demanding still-greater quirkiness are directed to wistful ""Ambell Waith"", which rocks both car-noise synths and village-green trumpets. Then there's the straightforward power-pop of ""Pwdin Wy 1"", ""Epynt"", and ""Y Gwybodusion"", which guarantee uncomprehending elevator-ride sing-a-longs. I mentioned this is all in Welsh, right? The language barrier is easy to forget, despite Rhys's occasionally harsh Brithonic consonants, because much like the Super Furry Animals' 2000 Welsh-language excursion, Mwng, this album strings together so much surface-level pop magnificence-- what Nietzsche called "" the whole Olympus of appearance""-- that its lyrics are, to English-speaking listeners, beside the point. Thus Rhys can cover a Celine Dion-worthy Welsh power ballad, ""Chwarae'n Troi'n Chwerw"" and we can raise our lighters none the wiser. All Yr Atal Genhedlaeth lacks is the unifying ambition of the great SFA records. That's understandable, given this album's casual nature. But the solo disc's off-the-cuff jollity befits Rhys's concert opener/closer: a pre-programmed elevator-synth rendition of ""Just the Way You Are"".","Super Furry Animals singer's first solo album is a Welsh-language slice of sunny, lo-fi pop.

Out of Breach (Manchester's Revenge),Mu,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c446c0084474cd0c365b/1:1/w_160/a13b0592.gif,2005-02-07 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5562-out-of-breach-manchesters-revenge/,Output,"""Welcome to Mu World, bitch!"" Yep, welcome to Mu World, with open arms, broken English, and some pretty fucked-up ""programming"" (though I suspect Maurice Fulton is having a field day playing keyboard drums in real time). If you didn't get enough of that leftfield house the first time around, you're in the right place. Of course, Out of Breach (Manchester's Revenge), the American-Japanese-by-way-of-Sheffield duo's second full-length, doesn't sound like house most of the time-- but any genre name would fail to accurately describe this music. The only tag that's consistently useful is ""six-minute,"" which roughly applies to the minimum amount of time Mu need to complete a great track-- ""Paris Hilton"" being the five-and-half-minute exception that just barely proves the rule. And I'm already exhausted trying to finish an intro paragraph about this record. Unlike 2003's Afro Finger and Gel-- which seems even better now than when it was released-- Out of Breach is less suited for a fucked-up dance party than just for being fucked up. Fulton's tracks veer wildly-- from hard funk-rock, hi-speed go-go blast, and mutant disco to dominatrix electro-performance art soundtrack and what sounds like damaged Japanese game show music. And that has to be good, right? Well, it is, but I can't honestly say it has more great stuff than Afro Finger; rather, it's a tangential breed. Where that album might have been described as ""weird"" or ""quirky,"" this one is ""kind of disturbing"" and ""dark."" These are hardly criticisms: Out of Breach is a different flavor of Mu, one that may very well make more sense to the experimental-centric listener, or even just the rock-centric listener. And there are jams here, but they're abstract and expressionist rather than weird and quirky. Of course, you'd be forgiven for getting lost in the shuffle of said jams. I did, and while it lasts, it's a mother. After the confrontational (even for Mu) opener ""Haters""-- punctuated by Psycho strings and big, fat rock drums-- Out of Breach runs through about half an hour of nonstop awesomeness. The title track is their best straight house foray, though with the horrific (read: perfect and amazing) echo-chamber ambience, android-monster vocals, and electronic gamelan backdrop, it's difficult to call it ""straight"" anything. Seriously, let this play for a while on repeat and watch the images blur. To pull themselves together, Mu unleash ""Stop Bothering Michael Jackson"" on me, with whirlwind bass line, brush-heavy (emphasis on heavy) drums and Mutsumi Kanamori's request to the stupid, dumb bitch who wants to make a fake story and won't leave MJ alone, ""suck a dick!"" And hmm, the drums just got all machine gun on me, and where did this wind machine come from? ""Tiger Bastard"", ""Throwing Up"", and ""Extreme"" are all variants on Mu's secret weapon: mid-tempo funk-rock bordering on disco like DFA does disco-- think ""Tell You Something"" from Afro Finger. The first one brings out the congas and growling bass line to underscore Kanamori's string of curses, both at regular speed and drastically slowed down for added queasiness. In fact, ""Tiger Bastard"" reminds me of a song that should have been on the LCD Soundsystem album were it equipped to push as many buttons as Out of Breach. ""Throwing Up"", opening chorus of heaves notwithstanding, is a masterful hybrid of post-Stubblefield drum(-machine) acrobatics and house pump-- Fulton had to have been a drummer in his pre-Mu days. ""We Love Guys Names Luke"" doubles the tempo and invites the punk guitars and handclaps to make things a little bit more hectic, as if Kanamori's array of shrieks and vocoder-ized pronouncements weren't enough. Maybe it's asking too much to keep up such a pace, but I could have done without relative ""throwaways"" like ""So Weak People"" and ""Like A Little Bitch""-- the former being a bizarre, tic-tac take on a ""Fever""-style jazz tune, and the latter being that short game show thing I alluded to earlier, all dadaist and retro-futuristic. That's also known as ""goofy"" in less verbose circles, and though I'm all for goofiness in doses, it kind of wrecks the apocalyptic flow on Out of Breach. Maybe that was the point, and it's not as if Mu come up short where nightmare jams are concerned. In any case, it's still easy to be fascinated by these people, and even easier to let the best parts of this record do what they will to me. If that makes me Mu's bitch, so be it.","Mu follow the striking Afro Finger & Gel with this slightly goofier and darker follow-up, which features an extended version of the 2004 single ""Paris Hilton"".

The Hate Yourself Change,Neva Dinova,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97e5e6ef9596932298d/1:1/w_160/5b89260f.jpg,2005-02-06 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5912-the-hate-yourself-change/,SideCho,"The last thing we heard from the long running but little recognized Omaha band Neva Dinova was 2004's One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels, a split EP with Bright Eyes. It seemed like Oberst was assisting a band he admired, one that would earn exposure and credibility by sharing an EP with him. Neva Dinova actually outshone Bright Eyes on the EP, as Jake Bellows's weary voice oozed over sepia-toned Americana that was clear and concise if occasionally a bit murky. Now that the group has become known outside of Omaha, here's its proper coming-out party, The Hate Yourself Change. Neva Dinova has crafted a dreamy, slow-burning lament that is consistently pleasant, occasionally exceptional, and-- in inspired spurts-- aimed squarely at the FM band. This newfound directness from a band that used to play triple-guitar slowcore jumps out from the first track, ""Hat O'er Eyes"", which is comprised solely of treacly vocals and a folksy acoustic strum. Bellows has a rich, aching voice, like a rough-around-the-edges Jeff Buckley, yet refrains from the affected drama of Omaha heavy hitters like Oberst or Son, Ambulance's Joe Knapp. The sultry ""Ahh"" blossoms with angelic harmonies as Bellows switches between winsome emoting and a deadpan drawl; with its delicate phrasing, subtle shimmer, and steady increase in intensity, it wouldn't be out of place next to Coldplay. One of the few upbeat songs on the album, ""She Can't Change"", follows suit-- it's a steady build around a pristinely simple and poppy guitar figure. But in the end, this same consistency may be what keeps Neva Dinova breaking out of Omaha. Too many of their songs are agreeable but interchangeable. ""The Champion"", Can't Wait to See You"", ""Blackest Heart"", ""Cold Calls"", and ""On/Off"" have little to recommend one over the others: They're all depressive ballads that build to radiant peaks, tinged with gentle psychedelia, recessed harmonies, and Bellows's able but unvaried vocal presence. But there are bright flashes of deviation on The Hate Yourself Change that indicate Bellows is struggling out of his perennial mode. ""A Picture in Pocket"", with its lean, repetitive throb and tightly reverberating guitars, sounds a lot like Franz Ferdinand, especially the fey vocal chorus. And ""I've Got a Feeling"", the album's closer, trades in Bellows's lovelorn aphorisms for a more caustic vocal and lyrical turn, a weary, expletive-riddled screed that mounts toward the choral refrain, ""The world's a shitty place and I want to die."" Barring these aberrations, The Hate Yourself Change works best as an innocuous bedtime record; including them, it's a snapshot of a band taking a tentative step toward the next echelon of recognition and accomplishment.","Second LP from pals and split-single partners of Bright Eyes.

Silizium EP,Apparat,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a181ea9e61561daa4800/1:1/w_160/c0ff0572.jpg,2005-02-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/418-silizium-ep/,Shitkatapult,"The restless creations of prolific Berlin-based Sascha Ring (aka Apparat) have always seemed unfixed and polymorphic even by the transitive standards of experimental IDM, with albums like 2003's Duplex actively oscillating between electronic and acoustic instrumentation as well as various jittery micro-idioms. Though his techniques have typically resulted in music that is both wildly unpredictable and compulsively listenable, the continual evolution of his productions has left him with few distinctively recognizable sonic trademarks. Perhaps that's beginning to change, however, with the release of Silizium, an unusually refined and focused five-song mini-suite that finds Ring and his collaborators satisfyingly integrating classical elements into melancholic electronica. Originally recorded for a John Peel session at BBC in 2004, Silizium (the German translation for ""Silicon"") features extensive contributions from a string section known as Complexácord, comprised of cellist Lisa Stepf and violinist Kathrin Pfänder. Several tracks also include chilled vocals from electro-soul crooner Raz Ohara, as well as some fiery jazz licks from clarinetist/sax player Hormel Eastwood. Apparat binds these disparate elements together with agitated, frayed beats and spellbinding electronic drones, providing these five uneasy pieces an intense, cohesive urgency. With Ohara's voice carrying its pensive melody, the driving clatter of ""Komponent"" emerges following the brief instrumental ""Introduction"" like an emergency vehicle weaving its way through commuter traffic, while Stepf's spine-tingling, attenuated cello notes sound a siren over the din. On the subsequent title track, Eastwood's blaring reeds gradually give way to a simple, repetitive melodic motif from the strings, before Ring huffs and puffs trying to blow the house in with his termite-ridden beats. Ohara takes over again on the cinematically taut, insistent ""Not a Good Place"", defiantly keeping his choruses afloat upon a surging tide of fractured keys and strings, before everything finally drains out into the quiet pools of the chamber-like ""It's Gonna Be a Long Walk"". Those five tracks sound like an extended composition, and are further augmented by an adventurous (if somewhat redundant) quartet of remixes. Bus' remix of ""Silizium"" enthusiastically chews everything down to unrecognizably tiny pieces, while Telefon Tel Aviv's take on ""Komponent"" adds enough swirling indie-pop texture that it almost resembles a long-lost Talk Talk single. Apparat closes things up himself, giving ""Not a Good Place"" one final, yearning spin as its concluding microscopic violin notes flutter off like drowsy fireflies, allowing Silizium at last a hard-won interlude of peace.","New EP from these Bpitch Control and Shitkatapult signees runs full-length, containing five new tracks and four remixes.

Jon De Rosa meshed somnolent ambient soundscapes and shoegazer melodies, drawling dolorous, just-shoot-yourself-already vocals that belied the richly melancholic instrumentals. As part of Darla's Bliss Out series, the album showed an uncharacteristic devotion to acoustic instrumentation, often layering brass, orchestral percussion and warbling tremolo-sodden guitars atop wooly electronic textures. In the end, pop won out; well-structured songs like ""Aura Lee"" and ""Nostalgia = Distortion"" trumped the album's more nebulous sections with wan, intimate melodies. The common thread running through De Rosa's compositions, both catchy and inchoate, was sadness, and that thread continues on Bleeding Light, Aarktica's fourth and least confused album. Staking ground between Johann Johannson's cool meditative drones and Stars Like Fleas' flailing electro free jazz, the album is tonally consistent, shuffling between heavy-hearted melodic ephemera and perambulating instrumental passages. The best example of the latter is ""A Shadow Knife (Draws Bleeding Light)"", which is underpinned by slow-pulsing guitar drones as it ventures on an eight-minute expedition led by horns and drums. Followed by the ringing doppler swells of ""We're Like Two Drops Separated By a Drowning"", the pairing cuts a tidy architectural swath across the album, bisecting its eight tracks and setting up a taut finale. ""A Wash a Sea Goodbye It's Me"" reinstates the acoustic elements; summoning Do Make Say Think with lulling guitars, soft horns and hard-driven drums, the song is as close as De Rosa gets to an all-out rocker. Hardly disrupting the album's swooping flow, ""A Wash a Sea Goodbye"" gives way to a pair of drone-saturated epics. The climactic title track licks a twangy middle eastern drone, spreading a murmured, meditative vocal over the slow-moving mass. The song's finale is a rare bit of populist hopefulness (""Everyone of us is lost in our own way""), offering tenuous yet satisfying circularity: In contrast with the oppressively grim chords of opener ""Depression Modern"", its cautious optimism rings of victory. It seems De Rosa has finally reconciled himself with unhappiness-- and it's that flowering that makes Bleeding Light, at times gruesome and hard to stomach, a compelling listen.","Aarktica's latest drone-pop offering stakes its ground between cool, meditative hums, and flailing electro free jazz.

Nobody's Listening/Nobody's Watching,Pernice Brothers,by: Stephen M.

Or, possibly, it's a slight to the band's diehard fans who regularly turned up at shows to lend their shouts and applause to the background of this live recording. Despite the title's tongue-in-cheek bitterness, we should at least give the Pernice Brothers the benefit of the doubt-- and not just because they thank their fans in the liner notes. The band, lead by real-life Pernice brothers Joe and Bob, has been creating letter-perfect pop since 1997, manufacturing three albums of songs wherein each lyric, each harmony, each bridge was precisely calibrated to elicit a particular listener response. As a result, albums like Overcome By Happiness and Yours, Mine & Ours sound so pristine, polished, and practiced that they can tend toward unexciting. By definition, a live album like Nobody's Listening-- recorded at the Mercury Lounge in New York-- cures part of that problem in that no matter how much a band practices, each performance is affected by uncontrollable variables from crowd reaction to venue temperature to PA differences. Nobody's Listening adds a few much-needed blemishes to Joe Pernice's songwriting gems: Engineered and mixed by bass player Thom Monahan, the sound is rougher and more ragged but livelier and more dynamic than their studio albums. Joe Pernice's vocals are low in the mix, and sometimes he sounds like he's straining alternately to hit notes and to be heard. The keyboards on ""Sometimes I Remember"" sound dissonant and sub-Casiotone, and elsewhere instruments sometimes get lost in the mix. In some cases, these factors might be considered flaws; on Nobody's Listening they lend the songs a sense of spontaneity. ""Working Girls"" now sounds as gritty as its subject matter. ""Crestfallen"" drips with disdain as Joe remarks ""it's hard to read her simple mind."" The raw guitars bring out the desperation and deprecation on ""Grudge Fuck"", a song from the Pernice brothers' previous band, the Scud Mountain Boys. Their cover of the Pretenders' ""Talk of the Town""-- which is the only non-album track on Nobody's Listening-- rumbles along thanks to James Walbourne's piano and Patrick Berkery's drums. And ""Flaming Wreck"" ends with a noisy barrage of instruments that closes the show perfectly. As documented on the Nobody's Watching DVD tour diary, the Pernice Brothers have spent most of the past seven years on the road, playing small clubs for varying audiences. That experience has made them a better live than studio band, as Nobody's Listening amply displays.","Live CD/DVD pleasantly roughs up Joe Pernice's Americana.

We Will Become Silhouettes EP,The Postal Service,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a105ea9e61561daa46c5/1:1/w_160/88ae8c41.jpg,2005-02-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6433-we-will-become-silhouettes-ep/,Sub Pop,"I think I can say without exaggeration that the Postal Service is the most important band in music history. Okay, in the past five years. Three years. In the genre of indie rock. In the sub-genre of indie rock with laptops. In the sub-genre of indie rock with laptops featuring Ben Gibbard. On Sub Pop. Okay, maybe they're not so important in the grand scheme of things, but for a group of their size and funding, the Postal Service have been surprisingly ubiquitous. Thanks to that ""Scrubs"" guy, ""Such Great Heights"" has been added to Hollywood's palette of trailer music, perfectly expressing that ""dramedy about quarter-life crisis"" sensation. The friendly resolution to the band's mini-spat with the actual United States Postal Service earned them national coverage, and a choice gig at the influential Postmaster General National Executive Conference (which, as you may remember, launched the career of the Beatles). And the duo's brand of point-click indie-pop has begun to inspire their peers to follow suit: Rather than find his own tech support for his recent digital wanderings, Conor Oberst merely picked up his phone and growled (quaveringly) to his secretary, ""Get me Tamborello!"" All of which is good reason for Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello to celebrate with a few cold-brewed Coors Lights-- but not a reasonable justification to shake the last few shards of pocket change out of two-year-old Give Up. ""We Will Become Silhouettes"" is one of the flatter tracks from that album's saggy middle, an unsettlingly chipper song about living through the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. Christmas carol backing vocals, accordion samples, and the climactic New Order keyboards can't distract from lyrics about fallout shelters and uncontrollable mitosis-induced body explosions. It's difficult to think of a movie looking for that lap-pop Hiroshimal sound... maybe it could be the love theme from 56 Days Later. The single's lone new track is ""Be Still My Heart"", which-- as its title might imply-- is typical Postal Service heart-meet-sleeve territory. Sadly, it seems only half-hearted: Built around dreary old guitars and live drums, it sounds more or less like a Death Cab demo with a few anxious clicking noises added to it. Clicking noises are also the weapon of choice on the single's two remixes, Morr Music producer Styrofoam's take on ""Nothing Better"", and Matthew Dear's reworking of the A-side. The Human League-biting medical terminology duet of ""Nothing Better"" is much more deserving of promotion to single status than ""Silhouettes"", but sometime-Notwist (and Gibbard) collaborator Styrofoam doesn't add much to the original, oddly choosing to make it more rockier while adding a rhythm track that sort of sounds like a guy making the O-face and flicking his cheeks. Ghostly International tech-house wunderkind Matthew Dear takes a few more liberties with ""Silhouettes"", giving it the old separate-the-elements treatment and spiking the track's drink with a handful of Ambien. The swirling ambient loops alter the music to fit the lyrical creepiness a little better, but it still doesn't quite nail the mood, perhaps due to Gibbard's incorruptibly saccharine delivery. Someone should've been a bit more willing to goth it up, or maybe just have given the song over to another band, a la the Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights"" single. Anybody death metal would do (though I guess it'd be hard to find one with a Sub Pop contract). So in the end, We Will Become Silhouettes does little more than advertise for a revisitation of Give Up. One wonders if the protracted flogging of that album means that new product from the band is far off-- especially since Gibbard is busy riding Death Cab's prestige into the indie MOR growth market, and Tamborello is embracing his newfound role as the go-to guy for indie heartthrobs looking to modernize their sound. If so, that's a shame, as their snail-mail collaboration remains the most effective shuffling of the IDM and indie scenes in decades. Well, okay, in the past three years.","Two years after its release, the Postal Service just keep milking the debut, Give Up: This new EP features the title track, one new song, and remixes by Matthew Dear and Styrofoam.

Less than two years after their debut Vehicles & Animals, the band have dropped the sunny guitars, quirky vocals, and Coldplay comparisons for keyboards, strings, and mini-series melodrama. On Tourist, Athlete become radical neo-Britpop fundamentalists according to the gospel of ""Trouble"" and ""The Scientist"". At times they tell sob stories so terrifically upsetting that even their detractors have trouble keeping tears from jerking. The catalyst for this transformation was lead single ""Wires"", the stringy super-ballad leadman Joel Pott penned after his prematurely born daughter suffered from epileptic attacks. ""You got wires, goin' in/ You got wires, comin' out of your skin/ You got tears, making tracks/ I got tears, that are scared of the facts,"" he whispers. It's the best song about childbirth since Creed's ""With Arms Wide Open"", though considering that song can't even hold a candle to Live's ""Lightning Crashes"", that's not saying much. Drama in music works perfectly fine in mediated, tactical doses, but for Tourist, the stakes are unrealistically high. Every song aspires for that movie scene where the guy, after finding his estranged father and kicking his drug habit, is reunited with his girlfriend...in an airport. Athlete abuse the soft verse/loud chorus trick to no end, leadoff track ""Chances"" being the biggest culprit. After Potts sings, ""Maybe there's a chance our walls might fall,"" a flurry of strings swiped from The Flaming Lips' ""Race for the Prize"" are formulaically cued. Potts then repeats the refrain until he's squeezed every drop of sentimentality from the line ""Take me over."" The final result is a safe cry-by-number, reproducible for a full album. Here's the kicker: For a band that tries so hard lyrically, Athlete feel no pressure to experiment with their songwriting. Potts' best attempt at a hook here is to hold a note over swelling strings. Athlete were never a particularly innovative band, but even Vehicles & Animals's flimsy IDM preferred to Tourist's homophonous gloom.

While the rest of Tussle basslines get stuck straddling groove and hook pretty safely, the line on ""Ghost Barber"" alternates duties: verse is pretty, chorus is rhythmic. The song has some tension; it almost sounds like a song. ""Moon Tempo"" makes the same distinction without even modulating. ""Eye Contact"" is still cooler than both, and probably better, expect the track came out two fucking years ago, then again on last year's Don't Stop EP. Maybe this is an East Coast thing, but ""Three's a charm"" is just something married people say when they're figuring out how many babies to have. Recall the pan-knockers of yestergraph: when the bass goes faceless on Kling Klang, these guys pick up the slack. ""Disco D'Oro"" taps the fractal noise vein Dom spotted in recent Brooklyn noise records such as Black Dice's Creature Comforts and Excepter's KA, but Tussle beat both out with four-four on top and more noise to boot. This is a patient man's game, Kling Klang, unclear at all times whether it's worth playing the regulation forty minutes, but another so you know: the last minute of last song ""Tight Jeans"" is motorik bliss and the best fake Neu! you'll hear this year.","Dancepunk goes dub as the basslines on the debut full-length from these recent Troubleman signees straddle both hook and groove.

Blue Eyed in the Red Room,Boom Bip,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a348c0084474cd0c0233/1:1/w_160/f73b0951.jpg,2005-02-03 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/860-blue-eyed-in-the-red-room/,Lex,"There's a growing divide between the rigid, stagnant packaging trends in guitar-based music and the more organic, unencumbered ones in sample-based music. Rock remains shackled to the discrete packets of the album and single, a format that isolates bands and individual works like eggs in a carton. But electronic music is a bowl of commingled yolks, spread over a broad communal surface area comprised of incestuous alliances, plentiful compilations, and proliferating remixes. This collaborative, revisionist sensibility refreshes the genre's vitality. Boom Bip, like many of his peers, has insinuated himself into electronic music by scattered, piecemeal degrees, a process antithetical to indie rock's perception of album-as-ultimate-statement. Many electronic albums seem like mere fodder, blocks of digital marble to be collectively sculpted and re-sculpted. As soon as Boom Bip's first LP for Lex, Seed to Sun, was in the can, it was remixed into two EPs-- Morning and a Day and From Left to Right-- which were packaged together as Corymb. While Boom Bip's third LP is primed for the same sort of viral mutation as his debut, it finds him working coherently within the album format by pursuing his themes to their logical conclusions. Built from analog instruments, Bryan Hollan's opus (groan) is more firmly rooted in pop than you'd expect-- especially if you know Boom Bip from the splintering night terrors he created with Doseone on Circle. You're more likely to find understatedly triumphant, New-Order-in-miniature synth leads (on the elastically melodic ""The Move"") than cluttered collages and fragmentary ideas. A couple vocal cameos further widen the album's stance: Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys lays a hypnotic, layered incantation over the lean, peristaltic drone and clatter of ""Do's and Don't's"", while Nina Nastasia, a gifted vocalist who sounds like a less piercing Joanna Newsom, sings a gorgeous torch song over billowing melodic clouds on ""The Matter (of Our Discussion)"". Blue Eyed in the Red Room is a restful wash of clean, simple lines, unfractured beats, and neon-tinted melodies. The songs are multi-phased and elegantly phrased. Opening track ""Cimple"" deliberately alternates between broad swathes of guitar remindful of M83's latest single, and winnowing, hiccupping sections that are one Ben Gibbard shy of a Postal Service. The dewy electroacoustic progression of ""Dumb Day"" evokes the tumbledown pastorals on Bibio's recently excellent album Fi. I'm sure the remixes of Blue Eyed in a Red Room will be profligate and terrific; but in this instance, the source material itself is well worth your while.","Boom Bip builds his second Lex LP from analog instruments and clean, unfractured beats.

Opencast Heart EP,Piano Magic,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06d9d034d5c69bf26f6/1:1/w_160/8d4a205e.gif,2005-02-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6286-opencast-heart-ep/,Important,"A few years ago, I read a message board thread that asked if there was a band that felt like a combination of Boards of Canada and the Sundays. Someone suggested Piano Magic, which made some sense. No matter what cast of characters surrounds Piano Magic's Glen Johnson on a given record, he has a knack for organically incorporating technology and sound processing to compliment the songs, which are typically gentle, sometimes ethereal, and always dour. If that BoC + Sundays idea once felt vaguely true, the four-song Opencast Heart EP confirms it. A sticker on the outside of the CD quotes Johnson as saying this the most electronic record has made, and who am I to argue? I certainly don't hear identifiable guitars or other conventional instruments. Actually, I don't hear much of anything-- this is an unusually subtle and quiet record, with most tracks consisting of some ghostly synth drifts and perhaps one or two slow percussion sounds. The lone exception is ""The Heart Machinery"", which-- while not exactly a burner-- rises to mid-tempo and has Johnson doing a neu-romantic croon at the upper end of his range, suggesting a contemporary affinity with Junior Boys or Styrofoam. Beyond that, you'll need snowshoes to negotiate one of Piano Magic's most wintry landscapes. ""Echoes on Ice"" sets the mercury falling, with some barely-there chord wisps and slight crackles of static to back the hushed whispers of rotating member Angéle David-Gillou. ""Echoes on ice on a blue winter night,"" she sings, ""from the spikes of your bike in sub-Fahrenheit."" Brrrrr. Her voice is suddenly thrown into reverse for the last couplet, ending the song on a haunting note. ""The Journal of a Disappointed Man"" is one of Johnson's spoken-word-over-soundscape pieces, and not a bad one as those go, though these ultimately have little replay value. Lines like ""I took a position at the Natural History Museum, but left after only three months due to allergies"" show he can have a chuckle at himself, at least. Best of all is the dry, minimal, and lovely ""I Didn't Get Where I Am Today"", which starts with David-Gillou saying she ""stayed home, snowed in"" and ends with ""the only light's a cigarette, the bed feels cold as ice."" Appropriately, she harmonizes with herself, alone to the end. After so much inconsistency, Piano Magic sounds best in small doses, and this tight unified EP shows that Johnson is still capable of creating interesting records.","Acclaimed ambient pop group's latest offers another quiet blend of technology, sound, and songcraft.

Push the Button,The Chemical Brothers,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a598c0084474cd0c076a/1:1/w_160/ff6764db.jpg,2005-02-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1419-push-the-button/,Astralwerks,"In the past few years, once-superstar veteran dance acts have found themselves faced with a virtually no-win proposition. They are dogged by the death of rave culture and bloated media expectations, and many consider their previous successes as major mainstream players in the states to have had a big hand in the perceived failure of electronic music. In some cases, the derision is justified-- the Prodigy and Fatboy Slim each recently issued albums that fell far short of their ambitious goals-- but usually, artists have simply gone through the same growing pains suffered by veterans in any genre. Of all the mid-90s dance crossovers, few are as vilified by the cult of progression as the Chemical Brothers, who never seemed particularly invested in electronic music's cult of progression in the first place. When they did act as pacesetters, it was for the oft-derided big beat (on their earliest recordings and debut album, Exit Planet Dust) or the prescient ""back to the future"" of the underrated Surrender, which predated and perhaps put in motion an eventual acid house revival. What the Chemical Brothers were interested in was bridging the gap between techno, house, and hip-hop by marrying the most immediately pleasing elements of all three. And incidentally, they weren't bad at it. On their day, they're still quite good, but superstardom also landed them in the precarious and potentially lazy pattern of presenting albums with what seemed like a preconceived template-- a handful of breakbeat- or acid-inspired tracks, a comedown psych-rock crossover, a female-vocaled comedown track, and contributions from Britrock's reigning royalty. The band seemed fenced in by these expectations, eventually crafting collaborative tracks that seemed to have the guest's talents in mind more than the Chemicals' themselves. Unsurprisingly, the duo's fifth album, Push the Button, is at its best when it avoids these now-familiar pitfalls. Unfortunately, it's mostly front-loaded with these high-profile collaborations, one of which (the tepid ""Left Right"", featuring Anwar Superstar) is a career low. Meanwhile, the Brothers have come full-circle on working with Northern England's most 60s-obsessed vocalists-- they're teamed here again with Charlatans and ""Life Is Sweet"" vocalist Tim Burgess. The result, ""The Boxer"", harks back to the duo's early B-Boy/techno days, as does the album's first single ""Galvanize"", recorded with Q-Tip. In both cases, however, the tracks are missing the ferocity and sub-bass rattlings of their earlier cousins, and here play second fiddle to unremarkable verses and nasally vocals. Far better is ""Believe"", on which Bloc Party singer Kele Okereke's rich, warm baritone serves as texture for the track while he provides a minimalist, almost mantra-like lyrical contribution rather than trying to crowbar a verse/chorus/verse structure onto a floorfiller. Elsewhere, rising indie pop group the Magic Numbers and Anna-Lynne Williams ably combine to fill Beth Orton's drony, narcotic role on ""Close Your Eyes"" and ""Hold Tight London"", respectively. Of course, as they were on 2002's Come With Us, the Chemical Brothers tend to find the best results when they focus on atmospheric, buzzing instrumentals. That 2002 record hit greater peaks-- nothing here is as engaging as ""Star Guitar"" or ""My Elastic Eye""-- but more than a few tracks come close, including the playful, old-school hop of ""The Big Jump"", the post-punk-meets-breakbeats collision of ""Come Inside"", and ""Surface to Air"", which recalls the astral, rave-quoting ""Star Guitar"" and ends the album on its highest note. And yeah, like the whole of Surrender and the best of Come With Us, these tracks are effective, delightful exercises in cultivating dance's past, but the Chemical Brothers have always been best when cherrypicking from others and creating highlight reels. If I were in a selfish mood, it would be tempting to wish a continued retreat from the spotlight for the Brothers, granting them the freedom to focus on creating the dynamic dance tracks they're still clearly capable of, rather than the merely decent pop songs that others are increasingly coming to expect from them.",,7.0,
Sweetheart 2005,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a833c0084474cd0c0d94/1:1/w_160/96f3dc75.gif,2005-02-02 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2062-sweetheart-2005/,Hear Music,"Your typical Starbucks' music selection leans markedly toward the middle-aged demographic that bought a few million Norah Jones and David Gray albums (and venti nonfat caramel macchiatos by the gallon, extra whip), yet oddly, whenever I recommend new voices in Americana or world-weary indie pop to a friend who works there, he's already heard 'em. It should therefore surprise no one (or at least, not me) that the second annual compilation of amour-absorbed covers from Starbucks' Hear Music affiliate features a handful of artists from the less challenging, safer side of indie music, each giving performances that even Pitchfork grandparents could deem inoffensive. It's all bound by a theme, of course: On Sweetheart 2005, love isn't just blind; it's also morbid, disjunctive, self-abnegating, strangely fearful, and all-important. Plus, it lasts forever. Just in time for Valentine's Day! Neko Case gives the album's most exceptional performance, sashaying through a faithful rendition of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks classic ""Buckets of Rain"" with her usual aplomb. ""Life is sad, life is a bust,"" she sings, and it's this awareness that makes the narrator's miserable adoration particularly affecting. Calexico tackles an even darker masterpiece, ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"", though their stately alt-country leanings inevitably lack Joy Division's urgency. Joseph Arthur tries his hand at The Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", but his slowing of the tempo and Americanization of the melody just mires Morrissey's blithely maudlin lyrics in unnecessary bathos. Meanwhile, Jim White's ""Use Me"", originally by Bill Withers, celebrates a love of the unhealthy variety (""keep on usin' me till you use me up""). Gary Jules adds unnecessary drums and synths to Cat Stevens' tongue-tied acoustic beauty ""How Can I Tell You""; another Teaser and the Firecat track, the mournful ""If I Laugh"", might have been a better fit. Sweetheart includes a few more traditional love songs, too. M. Ward demonstrates his gift for crafting earthy indie folk out of 80s excess, this time giving the ""Let's Dance"" treatment to Pete Townshend's cheesy but endearing ""Let My Love Open the Door"". Simply put, it's excellent. And frequent collaborators Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips turn in an arguably better ""Forever"" than Full House's Uncle Jesse, even if theirs somehow evokes ""Pomp and Circumstance"" more than the Beach Boys' Sunflower original did. Martina Topley-Bird, Rufus Wainwright, Milton Mapes, Sondre Lerche, and Old 97's add a few unremarkable stabs at standards (""My Funny Valentine"") and possible future standards (the Kinks' ""She's Got Everything"", Matthew Sweet's ""Your Sweet Voice""). Of course, if, as Lisa Simpson once observed, romance has been acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney, it was only a matter of time before Starbucks got in on the act as well.","Neko Case, M.

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory OST,Amon Tobin,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cb9d034d5c69bf38ad/1:1/w_160/d56fca3e.gif,2005-02-02 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8089-tom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory-ost/,Ninja Tune,"I play video games, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Well, maybe I'm a little ashamed. All: How ashamed are you? Me: If I were I carrying a ladder, I'd look like a fire engine. If I placed a leaf on my head, a child might polish me and place me on his teacher's desk. A salivating man with a boiling pot of water, a pair of tongs, a stick of butter, and a plastic bib is circling me menacingly right now. If you get my drift. Video games still aren't quite cool, but the arrival of Amon Tobin's noirish, cinematic soundtrack for the third installment in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell video game series, Chaos Theory, proves that they're at least getting cooler. It also illuminates how far video games have come since my mom picked me up from school brandishing The Legend of Zelda and just blew my mind (""Sweet heaven, it's gold. Not gray-- gold!""). As video games become more like interactive films, the ante is upped for their soundtracks as well. The canned, wobbly synth melodies that once cheerily bounced our 8-bit, pixilated heroes through their 2-D side-scrollers no longer suffice, and while this is the first video game soundtrack by a respected underground musician that I can recall, I seriously doubt it will be the last. Scoring a video game presents a different set of problems than scoring a film. The latter's structure is fixed, but the former's is variable. Splinter Cell is an espionage game with numerous environments, some revolving around tension and stealth, others around hectic chases and high-octane shootouts. The music needs to follow suit, and flow seamlessly from one mood to the next. Tobin handles this problem by making all the songs sound...well, rather similar. He takes full advantage of this opportunity to be as over the top as he wants to be, and his soundtrack is busy, dark, percussive, and abrasive. There are ""running"" songs (""CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA"") and ""sneaking"" songs (""chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga""). There are lots of sonar blips, modem crackles, alarms, and detonations. There are howling digital winds and fluttery textural embellishments (imagine the horror movie staple: ""Ooh Ooh ooh ooh...Ah Ah ah ah...""). While the tracks complexly evolve in Tobin's usual fashion, they generally begin with cacophonous, atmospheric noise to which lean, fleet polyrhythms are subsequently applied. The Chaos Theory soundtrack is James Bond panache meets dystopian nightmare. Sure, it's no Supermodified, but Supermodified wasn't created to be endlessly looped behind onscreen spy ops. This isn't a revolutionary album for Tobin but it's a lot of fun, and works surprisingly well on its own, given the stringent requirements it had to meet.","Ninja Tune star makes the jump to video game soundtracks with this score to Chaos Theory, Xbox's latest addition to Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series.

Close Selections,Mikkel Metal,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53f5e6ef95969323a8a/1:1/w_160/2350317d.jpg,2005-02-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5633-close-selections/,Echocord,"Over the past five years, Copenhagen-based producer Mikkel Meldgaard has been orbiting the periphery of ambient microhouse like a shadowy satellite, releasing his sub-aquatic, post-Basic Channel techno-dub in periodic 12"" maxi-single blasts on labels like Kompakt, Datamusik, and his homebase Echocord. Now, for the benefit of the vinyl-challenged, Close Selections gathers a generous sampling of highlights from his Echocord plates along with several tracks of new material. The cumulative gravity of this entrancing collection of miniature collapsed stars should be enough to draw you blissfully into its molten core. With his grainy, narcotic beats and fluent swells of crackly dub, Mikkel Metal can call to mind the best of Stefan Betke's work as Pole, particularly on earlier tracks like ""Eight"". Unlike Betke, however, Mikkel never allows himself to get so preoccupied with process that his compositions are consumed by stylistic tics or glitches. Despite their minimal construction, there is a refined, measured sturdiness to the melodic structures of these tracks, as well as enough variation of instrumental texture to enable Mikkel to keep his repetitions hypnotic rather than formulaic. Mixing tracks from throughout his short career without regard for chronology, Close Selections accentuates the consistency of Mikkel's aesthetic, yet still one can discern his maturation as a composer. Several of the best tracks here are among his most recent (including four which first appeared on 2004's Sorano EP) and each demonstrates a variant hue of Mikkel's transfixing approach. ""Larkin"" operates as straight somnambulant minimalist dub, with its pulsating keyboards providing all forward momentum before gradually disintegrating into aerosol haze, whereas ""Luomi"" builds its fragile castle out of a mass of polished, pebble-sized beats. By comparison, the 4/4 dancefloor throb of ""Image"" sounds positively locomotive-- its brief interludes of phased guitar providing a satisfying Lee Perry touch-- while the chilled slo-mo electro of ""Clora"" hangs in the air like smoke from a caterpillar's hookah. Of the previously unreleased material, only the set-opening ""Rollin"", with its anxious beats emerging like footsteps in the fog, adds anything beyond connective tissue, with the new, vocoder-enhanced ""Larkin (Reprise)"" counting as one of the set's only real misfires. Nevertheless, Close Selections not only proves Mikkel Metal to be one of the rare electronic singles artists capable of sustaining his captivating atmospheres over the entire length of an album, but that the impact of his spacious, icy-veined ambient dub is felt even more acutely in this full-length dosage.","Danish producer collects the best of his 12-inch singles and adds new tracks on his first full-length.

A Question of Temperature,The Chris Stamey Experience,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69f5e6ef95969320da9/1:1/w_160/b925c69a.jpg,2005-02-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7802-a-question-of-temperature/,Yep Roc,"The first thing to know about A Question of Temperature is that it's actually already been issued as another record. Originally credited to Chris Stamey & Yo la Tengo and titled V.O.T.E. (Shorthand, Stamey claims, for Very Obvious Total Emergency), it was released in a very limited run in October 2004 during the get-out-the-vote drive. This new version consists of the same recordings, with a new intro track (the voting PSA that lead off the original V.O.T.E. is converted into a bonus track at the tail end of the album, no longer urgently relevant but still charming), and an amusing whistling-and-marimba-driven instrumental called ""Dr. Strangelove's Assistant"". Otherwise, everything's the same: The Chris Stamey ""Experience"" is really just Yo la Tengo plus wayfaring keyboard wrangler Tyson Rogers. Stamey's old dB's bandmate Gene Holder handles the boards, and the set has the spontaneity you might expect from a bunch of friendly veterans playing together for three days. Discounting the incidental new intro track ""Conspiracy Theory"", the first five full songs are covers of old favorites, including the Yardbirds' ""Shapes of Things"" and Cream's ""Politician""-- both of which reflect Stamey's political mood-- a ravishing version of Television's already too-beautiful ""Venus"" and a rip-snorting take on Les McCann's ""Compared to What"" that takes the Brian Auger version to the cleaners. They even cover Stamey's own decades-old single ""Summer Sun""...twice. The funky version tucked away on V.O.T.E. as a hidden track is in the place here, while the version in the tracklist is janglier, stuffed with backing harmonies and Byrds-y guitar leads. That both versions are great is a testament to the quality of Stamey's writing. Stamey's other tunes are all pretty good in their own right, generally much punchier than the songs on last year's solo album Travels in the South. Yo la Tengo are obviously part of the extra kick, operating like the band they are instead of an assemblage of studio cats. The five-minute freakout that swallows the middle of ""MacCauley Street (Let's Go Downtown)"" comes complete with a crazy Ira Kaplan e-bow sojourn that the liners take pains to specify isn't a flute. In fact-- even though Stamey wrote all the original songs-- the double-billing once given Yo la Tengo makes plenty of sense because their input is central to the sound and success of the album. A Question of Temperature ultimately comes out a very solid if not revelatory record. The covers are well-chosen, the steps back into Stamey's old songbook are enjoyable, and the band are loose and obviously enjoying themselves. Obviously, the original intention of the record-- helping to get out the (non-Bush) voters-- didn't pan out well, but the final result is one of Stamey's best solo joints and a fun, solid record, so the ancillary benefits make it more than worthwhile.","Former dB's frontman is backed by Yo La Tengo on this repackaged and retitled version of their limited October '04 get-out-the-vote effort.

LCD Soundsystem,LCD Soundsystem,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdddc0084474cd0c2dba/1:1/w_160/98a39805.jpg,2005-02-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4978-lcd-soundsystem/,DFA,"James Murphy makes great tracks. He isolates cowbells and places the microphone at just the right distance from the hi-hat so you get the analog-crisp sound post-punk bands took for granted because they didn't know how good they had it with engineers like Paul Hardiman and Rick Walton. Murphy, obsessed with Can and Liquid Liquid, has the right influences at the right time in the right city-- which is to say, if he couldn't be French, New York is the best place for LCD Soundsystem. Like Parisian duo Daft Punk (who get their second Murphy shout-out on this album), LCD makes substance from style, content from form, something from nothing. That's a rockist attitude, of course, but then LCD Soundsystem is a rockist fantasy: full command of the history with none of the high-caloric obligation to ""meaning"" or purity. Murphy even puts together a live show that out-pummels the noise bands a borough over. LCD Soundsystem has been anticipated since Murphy's 2002 splash ""Losing My Edge""/""Beat Connection"", and like it, makes clear that although his musical reference points (Suicide, Eno, Can, ESG, Talking Heads, the Fall, and on and on and on) are upfront enough to be conspicuous, they never quite cross the line into hipster-wallpaper. In fact, if anything, Murphy has a given a good name to cooler-than-thou poses, presenting his music, if not irony-free, then as earnestly as can be expected from someone emulating Mark E. Smith's pronunciation-uh. And yes, his flare for singles is pretty amazing: ""Losing My Edge""/""Beat Connection"" and ""Yeah"" are two of the most ubiquitous 12-inches released in the last 20 years-- at least in the neck of the woods where folks are likely to get the Fall and Suicide references. Heck, even ""Give It Up"" rises near the top of DFA's crop of punky dance anthems, and that the second disc appending LCD Soundsystem contains all of this music shows both generosity and considerable foresight on the part of Murphy and DFA. However, it's still debatable whether or not Murphy makes great records. Where the singles emphasize his strengths-- impeccable arrangements (especially his signature drums-plus-drum machine attack), pacing (the dynamic expansion of ""Yeah (Stupid Version)"" is almost unchartable) and the gift of less-is-more-- his debut full-length lacks similar allure for almost the exact same reasons. It doesn't so much have a pace, per se, as nine distinct flavors of the LCD Soundsystem agenda, be it cowbell-ridden dancepunk, homages to any number of 70s and 80s hip rock icons, or rubbery would-be house jams just sloppy enough not to qualify as house. The production is as you would expect-- and therein lies the letdown: There aren't very many surprises here, either in the bank of sounds Murphy pulls out, or in how he uses them. Still, that wouldn't be bad if the songs lived up to the promise of his singles. The worst I can say about LCD Soundsystem is that there are precious few moments that stand up next to his most lauded singles. But we'll start with the best-- which is to say, he'll end with the best: ""Great Release"" is a very non-dancefloor number pulled out of the Big Book of Ambient Pop. Beginning with soft, pulsating drum machine pliff, the song glides for more than two minutes using only a stately chord progression on piano before Murphy's distant, obviously Eno-cribbed vocal enters. The song builds and builds, in a manner typical of many other LCD Soundsystem songs, but does so via lush echo, like ocean waves, watercolored synthesizers and Murphy's ""dat-da-da-da"" harmony vocals near the end. And where ""Great Release"" shines with a symphonic glimmer, ""Daft Punk Is Playing At My House"" and ""Disco Infiltrator"" stick to bare-basic LCD pump; yet, they're just as rewarding. (In fact, ""Disco Infiltrator"" should really have been this album's first single, rather than the comparatively indistinct Fall rip ""Movement""). ""Never As Tired As When I'm Waking Up"" is a near-brilliant pastiche of both White Album Beatles and Dark Side Floyd, with only its telegraphed George Harrison lead-guitar riff at the end and chord progression ripped from ""Dear Prudence"" keeping it from making as grand an emotional impact as it might. Likewise, ""Too Much Love"" seems just a bit too close to Talking Heads for comfort, though as with all things Murphy, the imitation is masterful. House-centric songs like ""On Repeat"" (a low key take on the structure of ""Yeah"", right down to the disco explosion near the end) and the excellent ""Tribulations"" (which prudent fans will know leaked months ago) should sate the danceheads, though they might have wished for more songs like the latter and some of the fat trimmed from the former. Ultimately, LCD Soundsystem suffers a similar fate: plenty of good-not-great stuff, and a tad unfocused. ","With two epochal singles and some of the decade's most engaging production and remix work under his belt, the DFA's James Murphy unveils his full-length debut with LCD Soundsystem. Also included on a bonus disc are-- at last-- his seven previously released A- and B-sides.

By day, mild-mannered Mr Kidwell leads a typical adolescent lifestyle, attending college classes, interacting with his peers, and exhibiting a healthy level of comfort with members of the opposite sex. Ryan earns good grades, gets along with his parents and enjoys making music. Weird music. Enter the alter-ego, Cex. Cex is a trash-talking IDM superstar who does funny dances. Cex is the self-proclaimed Number One Electronic Musician in the world. Cex removes his clothes on stage. Cex once remixed the Dismemberment Plan. Cex writes battle raps for the haters that criticize his style. Cex posts MP3s of these raps on his website. Cex co-runs his own label, Tigerbeat6. Cex flames other labels on their own bulletin boards. Cex once appeared in an Urb magazine article profiling America's best new electronic artists. Cex takes every available opportunity to remind others of his appearance in Urb magazine. Cex has been quoted as saying, ""Snoop Dogg has his shit together. I think he and I would get along really well if we hung out at the MTV Beach House."" Cex is pronounced ""sex."" And the list goes on. It's a strange duality, indeed. At times, Kidwell comes off as a quintessential bedroom composer-- the alienated, frail-looking but lovable nerd we see pictured against a backdrop of flames on the cover of his latest EP, Starship Galactica. Cex's early records took on a similar personality: reserved, cerebral and typically inaccessible. These days it's different. Catch him at one of his live shows, in which he scarcely plays any of his released material, and he's a raving savage. He spends most of his airtime at the mic, either freestyling to the crowd, or decrying the pretenses of the IDM scene. Cex accuses other musicians of cloaking their music in a false sense of mysticism-- building up a cult of personality by shutting themselves off from their fans, keeping their interviews terse and periodically issuing press photos of themselves in cryptic chin-stroking postures. On a mission to subvert the scene that spawned him, Cex lays himself bare on his website, recording his thoughts in a daily journal that he keeps on public display. This diary has grown into a 12-month catalog of Cex's preposterous bragging and Ryan's self-aware, insecure rants; it often feels as if the two are fighting for control of the same body. It's juvenile, humorous, endearing and admirable all at once. It also leads me to conclude that Cex has established a unique persona of his own. He's a geeky teenager with an ear for music and an identity crisis; he's been thrust into the spotlight and doesn't quite know how to cope. A departure from his previous studio efforts, the latest Cex release sees Kidwell reconciling some of the disparities between his various selves. Starship Galactica presents us with his most accessible yet accomplished output to date, interspersed with amateurish comedy skits that take cues from Big Pun and Outkast. The musical offerings on this platter run the stylistic gamut, from the squelchy electro of ""Cal and Brady Style,"" to the organic and acoustic Kraut-rock leanings of ""Get in Yr Squads."" The pieces never stray too far from their influences; and though no individual song pushes the envelope, it's uncommon to find such a motley array of mastered styles on the same album. Starship Galactica matches the instant, flamboyant appeal of Cex's live show with the quirkiness and complexity of his early releases. The charm of his new material reaches beyond novelty, and the sublime innocence of songs like ""Your Handwriting When You Were a Child in the Winter"" profits from each successive listen. ""Tattoo of a Barcode"" and ""Cex Can Kiss My Soft Sensuous Lips"" (the name is a play on the infamously titled Kid606 song ""Luke Vibert Can Kiss My Indiepunk Whiteboy Ass"") hearken back to the Cex sound of old, breaking from the conventional pop logic that the rest of the record follows. Both are brilliant, and their presence on this release indicates that Kidwell might think twice before he abandons his upbringing as an avant-garde laptop jockey. Cex maintains that he's an entertainer, not an artist. But the rounded feel of Starship Galactica suggests that, against all his protestations, he's thankfully still a bit of both.","19-year-old Ryan Kidwell suffers from a textbook Jekyll-and-Hyde complex.

Burn the Maps,The Frames,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be12c0084474cd0c2e12/1:1/w_160/b0af7706.jpg,2005-02-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3175-burn-the-maps/,Anti-,"On their well-received 2001 LP--the Steve Albini-recorded For the Birds-- Ireland's the Frames got miles of melodrama out of only a couple of guitar chords. Unfortunately, on their latest release, Burn the Maps, they're far more ambitious. The tracks here frequently sounds as intimate as those on For the Birds, but don't stay that way for long, often ballooning into sweeping arrangements and choruses that find singer Glen Hansard screaming to the cheap seats. It can make for awkward listening. Lost amidst the large-scale production, Hansard sounds particularly bare. On the earnest ""Finally""-- the record's best tune-- the Frames strike the right balance between strangled, melodramatic notes and Hansard's sincere vocals. But most other songs on Burn the Maps suffer from bloated arrangements: The delicate folk of ""Trying"" gives way to U2 stadium-scraping guitar, and ""Fake"" leaps from three-week-overdue pauses in its verse into a swaggering chorus. ""Dream Awake"" and ""Keepsake"" also reach overwrought climaxes they never deserved. Please, guys, please-- one song without strings in the chorus! Just one. I know you have a violinist in your midst, but there has to be another way to bring the bombastitude. ""Ship Caught in the Bay"" is an interesting experiment, with an Eastern-tinged drum loop and whispered, suspenseful lyrics. Like every track on the LP, it loudens and widens, but this time it's into a hard drum loop and electronic soundscapes rather than stadium rock. ""Underglass""-- the only track that sounds like a rocker from beginning to end-- provides some well-needed catharsis. The Frames could have used more tracks with consistent, engaging tones. Instead Burn the Maps often sounds like simplicity transformed into bloat in an attempt to sound interesting. It rarely works: Most of these tracks simply move from captivating to frustrating to regrettable.","Irish rockers' latest for Anti continues their tradition of blending trad-rock and bombast.

Peanut Butter and Jelly Live at the Ginger Minge,Coachwhips,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72ac0084474cd0c0b20/1:1/w_160/1fd0d144.jpg,2005-02-01 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1794-peanut-butter-and-jelly-live-at-the-ginger-minge/,Narnack,"San Franciscan devil children the Coachwhips scored best-in title and cover art honors with 2004's Bangers Versus Fuckers, which depicted a cute pooch lovingly tonguing his chocolatey barnyard pal. The record itself was a winner too-- an unforgiving, tinfoil-toned broken blues howl-- and only the latest addictive salve for followers of head Whip and Pink & Brown veteran John Dwyer. Peanut Butter and Jelly Live at the Ginger Minge is another goddamn home run, a reminder to bad livers and un-showered dancers everywhere that looking's free, but touching's gonna cost you something. It's not really live-- that's a joke. (Go ahead, try and find ""The Ginger Minge"" in a club listing.) But the record crackles with the flinty immediacy of a Coachwhips live show, where the trio sets up on the venue's floor and launches into a condensed marathon of feedback and foot stomp heroics. On Peanut Butter, Dwyer's consumptive wheeze and chaotic electric guitar spew lead his drums and keys accompaniment through 10 tracks in 20 minutes. Organist (well, Casio player) Val-Tronic and drum set attendant Matt Hartman have more to offer than their instrumental counterparts did on Bangers. Openers ""Body and Brains"" and ""I Made a Bomb"" establish Hartman's drumming as more than a flailing, pounding mess-- there's a discernable blues rhythm amidst the noise, and Tronic's keys tinge the ends of the notes like a headache in search of Excedrin. Now, Coachwhips aren't trying out for Fat Possum's stable of new traditionalists. They're just obsessed with creating an X-rated boogie machine (""Did You Cum?"", one song title asks), and patching into Hasil Adkins' amp provides more than enough stamina for the operation. There's blister pack noise (""Human Skin""), death ray reverb (""I Made a Bomb"" again), and even the occasional chord progression of more than two notes (""PB + J""). Val-Tronic steps up again for ""Letter 2 London"", where her organ plays off the rhythmic crash of Dwyer's guitar for a sound that fires wildly from a dark Memphis alley. Dwyer still stands at the center of the Coachwhips fever party. Though the occasional song title or ""I wanna!"" exclamation bleeds through the hiss, for the most part his vocals are a slot above functional jibberish. And this is perfect for Ginger Minge, since comprehension would cause the brain to consider the rest of this tingling, piking, base pleasure mess.","San Francsico indie rockers are more than eye-catching album art.

The Bodyshop,Beequeen,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47c13d1975652138d03/1:1/w_160/5c4ed2cd.jpg,2005-02-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1150-the-bodyshop/,Important,"Since the late 1980s, the Dutch duo of Frans De Waard and Freek Kinkelaar have blazed an enigmatic trail together as Beequeen, with the bulk of their back catalog consisting of impossibly rare singles, one-sided LPs, self-issued cassettes, and other seldom-seen relics. And much of their early work (at least in the trace amounts I've actually been able to track down) is as inscrutable as their discography is unwieldy, consisting of a formidable series of opaque post-industrial ambient dronescapes. With their 2002 album Ownliness, however, the twosome made an abrupt (relatively speaking) break with their past as they cracked open their heavy shutters just enough to allow in some stray melodic sunrays, even making use of polite trip-hop beats and ringing indie-rock guitars. Picking up from where the more accessible fibers of Ownliness led them, The Bodyshop is Beequeen's most musically expansive work yet, incorporating elements of shadowy folk and Faustian prog into their microsound tableaus. And though Beequeen's combination of electronics and folk elements is hardly an unprecedented (or untrendy) maneuver, few acts this side of Current 93 have so managed to lace their surface pastoralism with such unsettling, sinister nuance. Painstakingly recorded by Legendary Pink Dots guitarist Erik Drost, every sound on The Bodyshop has been audibly fretted over down to the tiniest electronic mote, giving these pieces an effectively claustrophobic feel that never permits the listener to become overly comfortable, quietly demanding the album receive unbroken attention. After opening with the Yo La Tengo-like guitar instrumental of ""Swag Cave,"" (one of the few unambiguously pretty tracks here) the gentle folksy arpeggios of ""Sad Sheep"" are soon overrun by itchy, drill-like electronic whines, segueing into ""The Dream-O-Phone"" where the microscopic mandibles of carpenter ants patiently consume the lush scenery. Elsewhere, as on the percussive ""Blackburn"" or swirling psych of ""One Road to Everywhere"", Beequeen begin to resemble the spacious avant-rock of groups like Cul De Sac or Dirty Three. Perhaps the track most illustrative of The Bodyshop's peculiar allure is their cover of Nick Drake's ""Black-Eyed Dog"", which features exquisite, double-tracked vocals by Marie-Louise Munck. Beginning as a near a cappella folk tune, Beequeen allow Drake's troubling lyric (""A black-eyed dog he called at my door...a black-eyed dog he knew my name"") room to gather depressive momentum before slowly adding layers of disquieting, clacking electronics which carry the groans of an antique winding wheel spinning gold back into straw. It's a mesmerizing, haunting performance, and it exemplifies Beequeen's skill for creating beguiling music whose tranquil surfaces mask treacherous, churning depths.","Elusive Dutch duo continues to add beats and guitars to its opaque post-industrial ambient dronescapes.

Constant Lover EP,Magneta Lane,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c541ea9e61561daa817c/1:1/w_160/baf324c2.jpg,2005-02-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5635-constant-lover-ep/,Paper Bag,"O Canada, how do you produce so many great bands? Maybe it's the cleaner air, the relatively liberal culture, the cold, the hockey, or the feeling that you're really better than your southern neighbor who gets all the attention-- sort of a younger sibling overachiever syndrome. Whatever it is, both Toronto and its thriving, consistent indie rock scene and Montreal's bundles of post-rock par excellence and really corking pop have produced a number of worthwhile bands in recent years. Magneta Lane can be filed under ""corking pop"", albeit with a bit o' punk-- mostly manifested in their incredible efficiency and high tempos-- thrown in for good measure. Guitar, bass, drums, vox and the occasional tambourine are all they bother with and all they need, and the three women who form this trio give you only the necessary material to drive the songs home. Guitarist/vocalist Lexi Valentine sings in a high alto range with a velvety, sassy tone-- and while the melodies are strong, it's the way the band pushes them through clever rhythmic shifts and dynamic alterations that raise them to a whole different level. The opening title track is their blueprint, laying out both their approach to tension and release and their sense of kinetic motion-- although that dry description doesn't half describe what a ridiculously great song it is. Valentine is up front (Uncut's Jon Drew gives them a punchy, clean sound with just enough grit to keep them honest) cooing over a jumpy, fractious beat, but as the verse progresses, bassist French and drummer Nadia King slide into an urgent rhythm. From there the song is pure exuberant pop fizz grounded by the emotionally confused subject matter of the lyrics: ""She could never find real love/ She was a constant lover"" goes the setup, ringing guitar arpeggios mingling with the vocals to coalesce into a gooey mega-hook. ""Ugly Socialite"" and ""Kissing Is Easy"" are even more tightly coiled, moving along like a coiled spring, stretching out through effervescent choruses and winding back up in the choppy verses. The only song that sacrifices this economy is ""Mare of the Night"", which gets louder and more distorted than necessary, sacrificing streamlined flow for noisy guitar excursions and featuring verses that aren't as neatly formed as the ones around it. All told, though, Constant Lover is an impressive, memorable debut by a band with a great instinct for developing songs for maximum impact.","Paper Bag trio delivers efficient, high-tempo indie pop thrills.

Blondie,Ada,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b55e6ef95969320252/1:1/w_160/2143e1d7.jpg,2005-02-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/466-blondie/,Areal,"This may be a difficult concept for you Dream Theater fanatics to grasp, but most of the time people aren't examining the finery of musical content as much as searching for something that simply captures the right tone. You can try to persuade me that tech-house is all in the details, but in a genre rife with strict guiding principles, Cologne-based singer-producer Michaela Dippel (aka Ada) is defiantly preoccupied with melody, a priority she uses to her iconoclastic advantage. She might be tech-house's version of the Strokes: Her new album Blondie is simple but slyly detailed, and exudes a self-assured cosmopolitan vibe. Part of Blondie's success is due to Dippel's preference for a soft, steady kick drum, which gives her beaming melodies a lot of wiggle room. And she uses it: Like the works of many of her Cologne cohorts, everything gets chopped and transmogrified before being spit out. But Dippel is generally more direct than her peers; Blondie throbs with classic hooks, laid out in gushing aurora synths and purring vocals. ""Eve"" carries the album in on a wave of smooching synth beams, incorporating vocals before closing with a chirpy, fragmented faux-guitar solo. The song's approximation of a vocal hook is a slinky bit of bait: ""Close your eyes and wet your lips,"" Dippel sings, slipping in and out of various filters and harmonizations. ""The Red Shoes"" features a distorted animal cry, which-- along with a thumping bass line and shimmying dot-matrix squelches-- pins the song nearer Boards of Canada than Luomo. The track even delivers a chorus-- a set of pulsing, ""Drop It Like It's Hot""-style synth changes that explode out of the bare, steely beat. If you're impatient, the album's middle third may seem bleak. But Blondie thrives on delayed pleasure, consistently turning hazy, going-nowhere beats into radiant climaxes. Most of the songs take a good four or five minutes to flower, but the finished product is almost always gratifying. Even the erratic seven-minute ""Our Love Never Dies"" recovers from a turbulent, tempo-less synth solo to find a viscous beat, which is slowly set aglow by a layered melody. ""Each and Everyone"", a remix of 2002's sensational A-side ""Blindhouse"", is the album's sparest, most orthodox moment; deriving clarity from Dippel's vocal and an icy bell-like melody, the track sounds like a decaffeinated Junior Boys. Ada ends Blondie with a whirl of dizzying pop-- her cover of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Maps"". Stretching and slowing the song's already austere melody, Ada proves the power of blushing sustained synth notes. Atop a more deliberate, broken-down melodic foundation instead of the original's bulldozer drumming and glowstik guitar line, the song's beautiful vocal takes on even greater tenderness. Karen O might be a hipster dream, but Ada is all dark sophistication. Her coy vocals and supple melodic sensibilities make it hard to hear Blondie and not walk away woozy and a little weak-kneed.

PREfection,Cass McCombs,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3fceb335119a49ed844/1:1/w_160/c554c433.jpg,2005-01-31 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5179-prefection/,4ADMonitor,"Singer/songwriters seem like a solitary bunch. Flying solo, these artists are thrust into the spotlight alone, where each lyric, song title, and liner note is assumed to be a window into the songwriter's life. On PREfection-- Cass McCombs's second album and first on 4AD-- the Baltimore songwriter welcomes this attention, feeling free enough not only to flash his emotions but to fictionalize them as well. From the song titles of ""City of Brotherly Love"" and ""Tourist Woman"" to the southern rockabilly of ""Bury Mary"" and Motown bounce of ""Subtraction"", McCombs sheds controlled amounts of light onto his travel diary-like life story. In the tradition of wandering American writers like Hemingway and Steinbeck, McCombs's goal is to weave fact and fiction, a goal he expresses with his own mantra: ""I don't actually want my biography to contain much in the way of actual biographical information."" While McCombs the lyricist roams geographically and emotionally, McCombs the songwriter meanders through musical periods. The fuzz-bass pattern and tense organ chords of ""Tourist Woman"" recall the dark psychedelic jams of the Doors, while lead single ""Sacred Heart"" borrows heavily from the Cure and the Smiths. Despite that genre-dabbling, PREfection sounds cohesive thanks to McCombs's arching use of slowcore-inspired repetition, organs and keyboards to provide the LP's texture, and prevalence to end tracks with their chorus fading out on repeat. McCombs hits a snag by spreading his creative juices too thin across the vocals and instrumentation. The result is a scanty ""wall of sound"" consisting solely of bass, guitar and organ/keyboard with little variation or build. On ""Multiple Suns"" and ""City of Brotherly Love"", the instruments are fixed in unison, diverging only briefly in the former for a lead guitar bend. It's pretty but it grows tiresome. McCombs does manage his own brand of boiled-down shoegazing when instruments play more independently. First track ""Equinox"", probably the strongest of the album, opens with a subtle, ringing guitar pattern as keyboards dramatically swell above steady, syncopated bass notes. McCombs adheres to standard song structure, but cleverly gives each instrument a run at carrying the melody. Midway through, the composition has already taken precedence over whatever lyrical labyrinth McCombs may have constructed. Instead of repeating verses for the apparent sole purpose of delivering more riddles, McCombs lets the music do the talking on ""Equinox"". For now, this is how the relatively unknown McCombs should aim to captivate listeners-- with his crafty songwriting. Then, once his celebrity grows to ""Cass is dating who???"" proportions, he can start throwing some lyrical knuckleballs.","Singer/songwriters seem like a solitary bunch.

Where the Humans Eat,Willy Mason,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53a0c2bba1b7de01415/1:1/w_160/476d7ccf.jpg,2005-01-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5629-where-the-humans-eat/,Team Love,"Where the Humans Eat is the debut LP from 19-year-old Willy Mason, out now on Conor Oberst's Team Love imprint. Mason's lo-fi blues/folk blend is refreshingly humble and unostentatious. Instead of using these standards as a springboard for modern adventures in composition, he sticks to their rawboned essence. Unlike some of his peers, Mason doesn't play up that rawness; instead he allows those old progressions to work their magic rather than forcing catharsis. The result is a more immediate, less cerebral album than you'd expect from such a green musician. Nylon opined that Mason's songwriting is ""on par, arguably, with lyrical mastermind Leonard Cohen..."" Cough! Cough! Excuse me, I swallowed my gum. Mason does evoke Cohen in lyrical style and vocal timbre, but in skill and substance? Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Nylon; the dude's not even out of his teens and you're comparing him to one of our greatest living songwriters. It's too much pressure. Mason displays admirable insight and humility for a 19-year-old, but this is still a teenager's record. ""All You Can Do"" is the product of a young man moving to the big city and being struck for the first time by the tragedy of homelessness. ""Still a Fly"" gets a little lyrically precocious (""But still, you're just a kid, you shouldn't read Dostoevsky at your age""), but displays Mason's charming melody and casual delivery. And the title track's gentle lullaby is belied by its petulant lyrics (""Why don't you listen when I stamp my feet?/ You don't belong where the humans eat""). ""Oxygen""-- comprised mainly of an ominous, one-note acoustic guitar rhythm-- is the clear stand-out. This is Mason's protest song, a procession of declarations, consolations and encouragements, each line a self-contained crescendo. ""We can be richer than industry as long as we know there are things that we don't really need,"" Mason intones, then slips in Holden Caulfieldisms like, ""I wanna see through all the lies of society, to the reality; happiness is at stake."" But these shallower invocations of dreaded Society only reveal Mason's tender age and amplify the song's impact. It seems to stem from a well of deep feeling and genuine concern. ""Oxygen"" displays a moral clarity that's easier to attain when you're young, but which makes for truly uplifting music, even to jaded moral relativists like me. ""Do you remember the forgotten America, justice, equality, freedom for every race?"" Mason asks with hushed intensity. If only for the span of this elemental song, you can remember the simple solutions of your idealistic youth, and it feels pretty fine.","Conor Oberst's Team Love imprint presents the debut LP from this 19-year-old singer-songwriter.

We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers,Chin Up Chin Up,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72813d197565213934d/1:1/w_160/8611e906.gif,2005-01-31 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1792-we-should-have-never-lived-like-we-were-skyscrapers/,Flameshovel,"Chin Up Chin Up's debut record had a back story before it was even completed; it's not a behind-the-music tabloid tale, but a genuine tragedy: In February 2004, the members of Chin Up Chin Up had just finished mixing demos for We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers, their first full-length, and attended a show at Chicago venue the Empty Bottle. A little after 1 a.m. on Valentine's Day morning, bassist Chris Saathoff ducked out of the club with his girlfriend. The couple crossed a neighboring intersection as an SUV sped toward them, striking Saathoff as he pushed his girlfriend to safety. The driver never stopped, and Saathoff was dragged for nearly two blocks. The 26-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. After that, the band ""all hung out together more than we hung out as a band,"" according to singer Jeremy Bolen. ""We didn't think about music for a long time."" However, after some encouraging from Saathoff's own parents and a few benefit shows at the Empty Bottle, the band were ready to continue, and completed the album while keeping as much of Saathoff's bass parts on it as possible. The only track recorded afterward, album closer ""All My Hammocks are Dying"", has no bass at all. Chin Up Chin Up's sound owes much to artists like 90 Day Men, June of 44, Slint, and Tortoise; the album's busy guitar parts, xylophones, and unwieldy song titles all scream math-rock. Yet on this record, the band sound like they're growing out of and beyond that scene. You can hear it clearly on the title track, which opens with swirling keyboards and an acapella vocal before the fastest rhythm of the album takes hold, which the band stops and starts around moody interludes and strange group harmonies. Elsewhere, a thumping post-rock intro falls away while the band gets all Rapture on the verses of ""Collide the Tide"" (re-recorded from their self-titled EP, this version has busier production and is a little stiffer) with phased synthesizers and hand-muted guitar scrapes. The band's kitchen-sink approach its arrangements threatens to overcome its melodies, but the tracks are saved by CUCU's grasp of tension and release as well as their memorable hooks. And tracks like ""Collide the Tide"" and the Modest-Mouse-ish rave-up ""All My Hammocks Are Dying,"" We Should Have Never... reveal a band with its eyes looking in a few different directions. The record's big obstacle is Bolen's vocal delivery. His voice doesn't sound ""bad"" so much ""forced,"" with vocals sung in hushed, scratchy tone that seems either insecure or like a misguided attempt at sounding cool. Fortunately, he doesn't always sing in such an affected whisper. There are occasions, like on the album's other big stand-out ""Virginia Don't Drown"", where Bolen reaches for the notes in a normal voice while the band breaks into a note-perfect Cure imitation behind him. Moments like this feel like cracking a window on the album's claustrophobic arrangements, and give a glimpse of how much more Chin Up Chin Up are capable of.","Determined Chicago indie rockers issue a promising debut.

Trials & Errors,Magnolia Electric Co.,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53bc0084474cd0c36d7/1:1/w_160/6a03309f.jpg,2005-01-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5630-trials-errors/,Secretly Canadian,"At first, Neil thought that Jason was truly the best roommate ever. It seemed like they had so much in common: nasal voices, a taste for writing long, slow, acoustic dirges, and a closet full of flannel. Sometimes they just stayed up into the wee hours of the morning talking about the apocalypse, and coming up with hundreds of song names that incorporate the word ""blues."" But all that changed after Jason grew out his mutton chops, bought a straw hat, and started sleeping with Neil's girlfriend! Truly, living with a roommate can be murder... Jason Molina has never exactly hidden his Neil Young influence; most of his work under the now-defunct Songs: Ohia nametag paternity tested right back to the dire epics of On the Beach's Side B. But after masterfully realizing and updating his idol's bleak, folk side on 2002's Didn't It Rain, Molina has spent the past two years dutifully understudying Young's plugged-in half-- first on Ohia's swansong Magnolia Electric Co., and then on the road with a band called, confusingly, Magnolia Electric Co. Got all that? If I could I'd draw a diagram. Now, for the first album released under his new alias, Molina rips another page out of Neil Young's playbook, releasing a set of sorta-new and mostly-unheard songs recorded live in front of an audience looking to drink a few beers and hear songs about Midwestern lonesomeness. In the spirit of Time Fades Away or Rust Never Sleeps, Molina lets road-testing and spontaneity trump studio polish, giving us his new material raw and solo-laden. Of course, Songs: Ohia fans are mostly just about the hits, so a few recent album cuts make the setlist as well. The tone of Trials & Errors recalls the final Songs:Ohia album's shift into country-rock territory, although this record's four-piece lineup can't recreate mechanical bull/chicken-wire stage stomp of Magnolia Electric Co.. As a substitute for bombast, the band provides generous doses of good old-fashioned jamming; no track runs shorter than 5:50, and that's mostly due to lengthy dual guitar dialogues between Molina and sideman Jason Groth. Yet, it's all a bit much for me, and I'm the staffer who likes jambands. Nowhere is this new penchant for jamming more apparent than on the reproduction of the two-song suite ""Ring that Bell"" and ""Cross the Road, Molina"" from Didn't It Rain. Where silence and empty space used to be Molina's most appropriate and effective accompanist, the full-band versions presented here fill every nook and cranny with excessive noodling. Words and melodies get trampled in the melee, as Molina's usually haunting lyrical obsessions with darkness, astrology, and serpents are suffocated by the arrangements. Things loosen up a bit when Mike Kapinus moves from bass to trumpet for ""Leave the City"" and ""The Last 3 Human Words"", but only the most devoted listeners will get that far. If you make it all the way to the finale, ""The Big Beast"", you're treated to Jason Molina screwing up my whole brilliant intro idea by just flat out directly quoting the Neil Young songbook, touching upon ""Tonight's the Night"" and ""Walk On"". I swear I came up with the comparison before I heard that part, scout's honor! If anything, that final homage suggests that Molina would be better off releasing an entire album of Neil Young covers while he tries to find a way to apply his strengths to the new, fuller sound he currently favors. The album Magnolia Electric Co. contained a few glimpses of how that could be realized, particularly in the use of Ben Keith-like slide guitar to provide a narrative moan through thunderous epics like ""Farewell Transmission"". But the band Magnolia Electric Co. is no Crazy Horse, and Molina's vocabulary on the guitar doesn't yet have the presence to carry such extended interpretations of his material. With his talent for musically mythologizing a bleak worldview, Jason Molina is the closest thing Neil Young has to a modern heir. But, for now, with his electric efforts, he's still just playing dress-up.","The first official release from the Jason Molina-led four-piece Magnolia Electric Co. is appropriately titled: It's a live album that finds his new group working out the kinks-- and aping Crazy Horse.

Sardonic or not, this kind of belly-speak marks a rare moment of self-revelation for Will Oldham, who skewers accepted notions of static identity nearly every time he lowers his big, bearded jaw. Still, Oldham (appearing here as contemporary alter-ego Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy) is, ultimately, exactly what he says he is-- smart and tough and weird, an awkward, oddly charismatic songwriter just as well-suited to coughing up death-ballads as he is to giggling out ditties about his penis. Witness, again, the bitter joy of loyal Oldham-hood: He is simultaneously quiet and loud, both crushing and absurd, and filed in seven different places at the record store. Superwolf, a new collaboration with guitar freelancer Matt Sweeney, sees Oldham at his squirrely best, squeaking out his finest songs since 1999's I See a Darkness. Superwolf marks Oldham's first official partnership with Sweeney, whose credits include a predictably brief stint axe-grinding in Billy Corgan's Zwan (alongside longtime Oldham buddy and Slint-forefather Dave Pajo), occasionally playing guitar in Guided by Voices, and fronting the long-departed Chavez (who released two revered full-lengths on Matador in the mid-90s). Sweeney's participation in Superwolf was supposedly a response to a songwriting ""challenge"" from Oldham, and in addition to songwriting, Sweeney contributes backing vocals and guitar figures that echo Oldham's own blows, sometimes with eerie accuracy. But despite all that buddying up, Superwolf is still at times unnervingly spare-- Oldham and Sweeney's pauses can be devastating, and some of Superwolf's most powerfully convincing bits pop up between notes. Opener ""My Home Is the Sea"" may sound an awful lot like late Grateful Dead (or, perhaps more specifically, like a slightly less raucous version of brother Ned Oldham's Anomoanon, who regularly employ Garcia-brand noodling and wild, space-rock somersaults), but most of Superwolf is quiet and intensely meditative, despite Sweeney's significant rock-inflections. Still, Oldham has always had a funny habit of inserting perverse, quasi-sexual shouts into otherwise-staid songs (see brutally confessional couplets rubbing up against phrases like ""my horny horn""), and at least thematically, Superwolf's eleven tracks are predictably shifty-- ""My Home Is the Sea"" is rife with snarky lyric tricks (watch Oldham follow the momentarily devastating ""I have often said/ That I would like to be dead"" with a tiny pause and silent giggle, finally finishing with: ""In a shark's mouth""). No matter who or what he calls himself, Will Oldham has always been uniquely capable of making colossal leaps in tone between breaths, and from track to track Superwolf nobly maintains that practice, drifting gracefully from classic-rock stomps to whispery dirges. Consequently, Oldham followers may recognize Superwolf as a welcome midway point between Oldham's past aliases, as it hops from shambling, Viva Last Blues-ish, Palace Music-era shakes to dark, Master and Everyone haunts. ""Beast for Thee"" matches a gorgeous, barely-there melody with self-deflating lyrics (""Why are you kind to me?/ You could so easily take me in your arms and see/ A donkey""), Oldham's quivering pipes and Sweeney's fragile guitar coalescing into a soft, droning, and tremendously pretty whole. The equally excellent ""Blood Embrace"" features some of Oldham's heartiest vocals, each word strong and full, floating above dark electric guitar swirls, dodging film samples of a faithless woman whispering to an unnamed lover, crafting an atmosphere so tense and ominous that you almost can't help twisting your face around to peep over your shoulder. Soft and subtle, Superwolf is the kind of record that unwinds slowly, and is best enjoyed over multiple listens and, unsurprisingly, many glasses of wine. Oldham and Sweeney mew coquettishly, stroking their guitars, cawing bizarre stories about love, death, and body parts: theirs is a rancid and beautiful landscape. ","A collaboration between Will Oldham and his longtime pal, former Chavez and Zwan guitarist Matt Sweeney.

Very Pleasure,Duran Duran Duran,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba013d197565213b126/1:1/w_160/0a41b59a.jpg,2005-01-30 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2594-very-pleasure/,CockRockDiscoVery Friendly,"Duran Duran Duran's Very Pleasure is good for a laugh. Cynics can cackle over their nearly album-long abuse of the ""Amen"" break, one of electronic music's most exploited beat samples that still somehow sounds fresh when DJ/Producer #2023 tweaks it. Irony-hipsters can magic-mark Duran+2 all over their Paul Frank and Emily Strange mini-backpacks, alongside singing the shoddy sample of a McDonald's commercial announcing: ""Holla! McDonald's Big & Tasty is only a dolla!"" Nostalgists can reminisce over the virgin year of 2000, when it seemed truly punk to desecrate NWA classics by laptop. Adolescent boys aged 13-43 can rub salt into their sexual frustrations by listening to Duran+2's field recording of what is supposedly an act of fellatio. Very Pleasure is a pile of crap dipped in fool's gold. A Philadelphian named Ed Flis is the mastermind behind Duran+2; the CockRockDisco website declares, ""One might call him the new John Holmes."" The music is co-produced by Michael Chiaken and Tony Gabor, and blessed by CockRockDisco owner/trashcore maven/former Donna Summer, Jason Forrest. A majority of Duran+2's debut album resemble remixes of Forrest's vaudeville; they typically graft a familiar sample of a crass pop or hair-metal blurt, and then pulverize it with the sound of a drum machine rolling down a hill in a garbage can. There is nothing subversive here, but enough intelligence exists to warrant a few clever moments. Opener, ""I Hate the 80's"" is nothing more than an Amen'd take on the computer-expo funk of Yazoo's ""Don't Go""-- good times from dimly lit memories. The stronger ""Manrammer"" is an essay on the Amen break that deftly compiles virtually every fingerprint laid on that rhythm's call to arms-- the pitch-drops, the street-cleaner blows to the cymbals, the trudges through muck to baffle the dancefloor, the E-addled mood swings, etc. A snippet of Ace of Base's department-store reggae classic, ""All That She Wants"", figures somewhere in there. ""Gaetan"" is like a less memorable, less haunting version of Kid606's ""My Kitten""-- both songs sounds like a piano ballad that sits in a corner with its head buried in its knees while splintered beats ransack the house. ""Movies Unlimited"" could have gone further with its trunk-rattling Miami bass besides having distortion spat on it. ""Year of the Monkey"" and its inbred second-cousin ""Purple Passion"" are generic breakcore excursions with a few douses of equally generic, Wagnerian trance-techno synth melodies. Closer ""Untitled"" insecurely dabbles with busted-lawnmower metal guitar of what sounds like Slayer before falling into the gabber routine. Very Pleasure's most redeeming moments are the intoxicated raggacore of ""Hard Girls"" and the McDonald's jingle thrash of ""Pilldriver"". The latter is a prime example of a whatthefuckwasthat? break that is oddly missing from so much breakcore these days. And then there's the ""Interlude"", which first sounds like bare feet in mud, but is said to be a close mic'd performance of a national epidemic among American youth that Dr. Phil reminded our president about on his show. It's enough to scare children into abstinence.","Eighties nostalgia, Jason Forrest style.

Negrophilia,Mike Ladd,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc65ea9e61561daa747c/1:1/w_160/628d52b7.jpg,2005-01-30 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4624-negrophilia/,Thirsty Ear,"Mike Ladd is one of contemporary hip-hop's great innovators, even though he often either operates on the very fringes of the genre or leaves it completely. He has a warm, versatile voice, and impressive flow, but more importantly, he has a lot of ideas. There are times when Ladd's vision and reach are so broad that his music can't quite keep up with it, but he's skilled enough to consistently produce satisfying albums-- twice creating absolutely brilliant ones: Welcome to the Afterfuture and Majesticons' Beauty Party. Listening to Ladd, it's clear that unifying concepts-- such as the underground vs. mainstream rivalry/soap opera of the Infesticons and Majesticons projects-- are important to him, and his first entry in Thirsty Ear's Blue Series is no exception. Negrophilia takes its title from and is inspired by the writings of Petrine Archer-Straw, who wrote a boom with the same name (subtitled Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s). Her tome expounded upon the Paris art world's embrace of black American and African ex-pats-- and its co-option of their art and culture, which played heavily into Art Deco, cubism (earlier in the century), and Euro-jazz. Now, if most artists were to say their album was influenced by a particular work of non-fiction, you might notice the influence in one song or a title or the cover art, but Ladd is serious. He weaves examinations of the book's themes-- as well as civil rights-related sound clips and references to both military and cultural imperialism and conflations of early 20th Century European art and modern American pop stars (""Brancusi sculpting Beyonce in Gold lame/ Blond negress"")-- into his open-ended, heavily chopped and diced songs. The musical approach\xD0heavy improvisation revisited, reconfigured and reconstituted into dense sound collages yields plenty of interesting moments, but it also unfortunately marginalizes Ladd's rapping and also opens the door to passages that grow unfocused or cluttered. Ladd does have a crack band at his disposal, with drummer Guillermo E. Brown (a frequent David S. Ware collaborator) helping to shape the record through editing and electronics, Vijay Iyer adding keyboards, winds by Andrew Lamb, Roy Campbell on trumpet, and Bruce Grant on tape loops. They set a promising tone with ""Fieldwork (the Ethnographer's Daughter)"", opening with dry hand percussion and acoustic guitar to simulate a field recording and settling on an ominous groove for Ladd to drop a few lines over, manipulating his voice even as it's attacked from all sides by squirming loops and fluttering woodwinds and horn. ""Shake It"" runs away with the show, though, with its off-kilter, lurching beat, outbursts of sax and trumpet and Ladd's tense flow. ""Worldwide Shrinkwrap (Contact Zones)"" comes close to the glory of ""Shake It"", but questionable vocal processing-- including annoying pitch-shifting-- keeps it from getting there. That's indicative of the problems with the album's weaker tracks-- they wander through lengthy passages of wet noodle electro-jazz. Fortunately, the LP also has luxurious instrumental sections, such as the remarkable bassoon and trumpet duel of ""Back at Ya,"" or Iyer's piano meditation and Campbell's dusty solo on ""Sam and Milli Dine Out"". It's a shame that the disc isn't more laserly in its focus, because its best moments are stellar and exhilarating. We know from history that Ladd is very capable of making instrumentals that feel like they're going somewhere, so it's something of a mystery as to why he gets such mixed results here, but even great musicians aren't fail-proof.","Mike Ladd's contribution to Thirsty Ear's Blue Series takes its title from and is inspired by the writings of Petrine Archer-Straw.

Thieves EP,Shearwater,by: Stephen M.

And like any good scientist-- especially any good biologist-- Meiburg is obsessed with the particulars of life and death as well as the precarious border between them. The same can be said of his musical partner, Will Sheff, who acts the Lennon to Meiburg's McCartney. Both are the principles in Okkervil River as well as Shearwater, and both specialize in a brand of haunted, folksy, story-oriented rock that falls somewhere between the Shins' upbeat observations and Pinetop Seven's eerie Americana. While Sheff seems to be the more prolific of the pair, writing almost all of Okkervil River's material and even two of the five songs on Shearwater's new Thieves EP, Meiburg proves his match and his complement. Meiburg's ""Mountain Laurel"" is a bracing banjo stomp, with Scott Danbom's abrasive fiddle adding palpable tension to Meiburg's ruminations on the failings of the human body. Opener ""I Can't Wait"" begins with a plaintive guitar strum, then gradually builds to a caterwauling climax before returning again to that hushed acoustic guitar theme. ""There's Bark Where You Were Breathing"" creeps along on a quietly sung melody that at times is barely audible, as if the notes travel by breeze. Even so, it's Sheff's ""Near the Garden"" that proves to be the EP's best track and perhaps the most affecting song either of them has written. Set at the funeral of a friend, the song tries to locate some meaning in death, but finds nothing instructive or satisfying. ""You used to be a live body,"" Sheff sings (or it could be ""You used to be alive, body""), ""then you died."" He knows that the corpse in the casket is not the person he knew, just the empty casing of a snuffed life, and on the plane ride home, he laments how much life is inescapably wasted: ""The movie on the plane says life is for the living, as I sit slowly living, paralyzed with boredom."" It's a stark, unsentimental moment in an EP-- as well as in an ongoing collaboration-- that plumbs the mysteries of mortality without resorting to comforting platitudes or naive proclamations. Instead, Meiburg and Sheff both sound scientific, but never cold or clinical.","The Okkervil River principals issue their latest collection of haunted, folksy, story-oriented rock.

Songbook: The Singles Volume One,Super Furry Animals,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5cc5e6ef95969320baf/1:1/w_160/b6e5335d.gif,2005-01-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7604-songbook-the-singles-volume-one/,XLBeggars,"Could this be the end of our intrepid heroes? More than a decade after these blissfully genre-bending Welsh popsters burst through a rip in the space-time continuum with all the self-assured ambition of five guys in a (soon literal) armored tank, Super Furry Animals are presenting symptoms of a band about to re-enter the ether: a suddenly human album, 2003's Phantom Power; a solo project, singer Gruff Rhys's just-released Yr Atal Genhedlaeth; and now a career-spanning singles compilation. Marrying a Japanese avant-garde artist can't be far off. For those of you just joining us: Super Furry Animals were the most life-affirming British pop group of the late 1990s, retaining their yen for sunny melodies even as Radiohead perfected gloomy computer-age ennui and Blur's buoyant choruses sank into heartbreakingly dissonant sad bastard music. Since landing on this watery, sun-scorched planet, SFA have gleefully mish-mashed influences that include the Beach Boys, the Beatles, David Bowie, and Chemical Brothers. With 2001's Rings Around the World came 70s soul and widespread acclaim. Even Phantom Power added a touch of Byrdsian country-rock. Songbook spans all those sounds and more, cramming 21 perception-twisting singles on one disc. Yes, that means the band's plentiful instrumentals are absent, as are some of keyboardist Cian Ciárán's electronic contributions. But while Songbook contains a few sops to obscurity-seekers (the non-album gem ""Ice Hockey Hair"" and ""Blerwytirhwng"", from the band's pre-Creation debut EP), the disc aims more toward awing neophytes with the group's unbridled pop prowess than sating completists. The management is not responsible for hats, purses, or hipster poses lost during the ride. My sources assure me that Wales is a real place, but I prefer to think of it as an imaginary kingdom, like Oz or Narnia or a sovereign Iraq. Its national anthem would be this album's irrepressible opener, 1996's ""Something 4 the Weekend"", which somersaults down puffy cloudscapes like ""Mr. Blue Sky"" for the eclectic decade. ""The Man Don't Give a Fuck"" is Supergrass's ""Pumpin' on Your Stereo"" armed with 52 f-bombs, a Steely Dan sample,and leftist politics; the proggy quasi-Britpop of ""Do or Die"" very nearly cops its guitar line from the Allman Brothers' ""Jessica"". Quoting ""Juxtapozed With U"" might not get the girl from Poli Sci class out of that halter top, but its goofy vocoder come-ons will give you something to smile about as you stumble home wearing her Long Island iced tea. As with 1998 b-sides and rarities compilation Outspaced, Songbook is built like an album, not a retrospective. In other words, forget anything resembling chronological order. Thus the voluptuous bombast of 2002's ""It's Not the End of the World"" (which, to confuse matters further, wouldn't sound out of place on Blur's The Great Escape) fades into the ""Deadweight""-era Beck tropicalia of ""Northern Lites"", from 1999's Guerilla. Fortunately, the art-punky ""Hermann Loves Pauline"" and flange-laden ""Play It Cool""-- two of the most weirdly inventive songs from 1997's Radiator-- show up consecutively, albeit in reverse order from their original appearance. Wales has ways of making you think. Yeah, Super Furry Animals sure were a great band. Maybe you can catch them in 10 years when they go on their reunion cash-in tour and get the hype they deserve. Wait, what's that? You say the title is portentously denoted Volume One? That the Super Furries have already recorded much of their next album, due for release later this year? Shit, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. TO BE CONTINUED...","Singles collection celebrates the playful and frequently wonderful Super Furry Animals' first decade together.

Origin 1,Soundtrack of Our Lives,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e613d1975652138e09/1:1/w_160/2eafb1cd.jpg,2005-01-27 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7377-origin-1/,WEA,"Three years after Britpress guaranteed them worldwide stardom, Soundtrack of Our Lives have to be wondering where their friends have gone. While Swedish cohorts the Hives were touring worldwide and appearing on MTV award shows, SOOL's fame collapsed. The band's fourth album, Origin 1, won't reverse that trend. To disparage SOOL as derivative of bands like the Rolling Stones and Stooges would be a compliment; these guys would kill just to be the Dandy Warhols. The band's thin ""Really, We're Swedish!"" schtick-- in concert SOOL are decked out in kaftans and strut around like the Hives-- only makes things worse. When frontman Ebbot Lundberg shouts ""We're gonna last forever/ We're gonna make you feel so high"" on ""Transcendental Suicide"", the song exudes the rock'n'roll intensity of a middle school D.A.R.E. assembly. But forget about style and charisma: This band has no hooks and no energy. First single ""Bigtime"" has a throbbing bassline, huge drums, and catchy guitar riff, but no build-up. ""Heading For a Breakdown"" suffers from the same: After its swelling verse and pre-chorus, the band misses its opportunity to deliver a timely, fist-pumping chorus, instead settling to plateau with a discreet refrain. Speaking of which, Lundberg might have the worst chorus vocals I've ever heard. As he raises his voice, his raspy baritone dissipates into an extremely loud whisper and gets lost in the mix. This album's two best tracks-- two of the best of SOOL's career-- are actually slow-paced, folksier numbers: ""Believe I've Found"" and ""Midnight Children (Enfants De La Nuit)"". ""Midnight Children"" glides smoothly on an ascending bassline, while ""Believe I've Found"" lurches mysteriously through a minor folk progression, haunted by a thick, bluesy electric lead. Because neither song builds to obligatory detonation, Lundberg is more focused on melody. As a result, the songwriting is more unpredictable and the results are more rewarding-- neither of which can be said for the rest of the record.","Another set of retro-rock from these poorly named Swedes.

Sings Morrissey EP,Colin Meloy,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53813d197565213bf78/1:1/w_160/dbc26f2f.gif,2005-01-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5627-sings-morrissey-ep/,self-released,"Morrissey worship incites antisocial obsessions, insomniac eBay skulking, and impassionate conversation nonstarters about the irony of Mozzer's perceived miserablism-- but few transcendent covers. Like coddled infants, the former Smiths frontman's songs may just be inseparable from their progenitor. So how can the Decemberists' Colin Meloy hope to succeed where David Bowie, Jeff Buckley, Hootie & the Blowfish, and t.a.T.u. all failed? He can't. Meloy has admitted as much in recent interviews. That's why his six-song, tour-only Sings Morrissey EP is limited to 1,000 copies. But kids these days swap files the way the Yankees trade for pitching, so when the lead singer of a justifiably lauded indie band documents his pimply teenage fanboydom, 1s and 0s are bound to escape. As a quick download or a post-show impulse buy, these recordings serve their purpose. But the next time that C drive fills up, Windows may highlight a few ""rarely used files."" For the most part, Meloy picks his material wisely. The first five songs are all decent-to-spectacular Viva Hate-or Your Arsenal-era b-sides. Their obscurity works to Meloy's advantage, like NBC's old ""if you haven't seen it, it's new to you"" rerun marketing strategy. Either that or he may just have picked them because ""Suedehead"" doesn't transfer easily to a single acoustic guitar. ""My Love Life"" flip-side ""I've Changed My Plea to Guilty"" is the clear standout, as Meloy transfers Moz's piano-based torch song about a lonely innocent (""freedom is wasted on me"") into arpeggiated guitar and earnest, if faltering, high notes. ""Jack the Ripper"" retains the anthemic chorus's Humbert Humbert-like appeal, but lacks the violence that propelled the original ""Certain People I Know"" b-side or its still-darker live version. ""Pregnant for the Last Time"" and ""Sister, I'm a Poet"" are twangy, upbeat, and no better than their so-so Morrissey counterparts. It's on closer ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"" (here inexplicably listed as ""Every Day""; I'll spare you my exegesis on why that's significant) that Meloy's greatest failing, other than not being Morrissey, is exposed: his voice. Those thin, reedy pipes-- tailor-made for singing about pirates and architecture-- don't do these songs justice. Also, dude, check the lyrics: It's ""greased"" tea. As in, ""post-apocalyptic, tainted-by-nuclear-fallout"" tea, or at least nasty ""everyday"" tea. Meloy's valiant effort ultimately falls short. With luck, Morrissey will one day record a Decemberists cover or two (may I suggest ""I Was Meant for the Stage""?). In the meantime, Meloy's Moz renditions, however well-meaning, are unlikely to displace the originals or even motivate new listeners to seek them out. I guess no one can hold a candle to Nancy Sinatra.","Decemberists frontman's tour-only EP features six covers of Morrissey songs in an intimate solo setting.

Notorious Lightning and Other Works EP,Destroyer,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9739d034d5c69bf5219/1:1/w_160/57cb4a79.gif,2005-01-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2294-notorious-lightning-and-other-works-ep/,Merge,"For Destroyer fans, the six songs on Notorious Lightning and Other Works will sound familiar-- although perhaps not as familiar as they might think. All six tracks appeared on 2004's grandiose Your Blues, on which singer-songwriter and New Pornographer Daniel Bejar took his heady popcraft to new heights of synthesized theatricality. At subsequent live gigs, however, Bejar performed with the crazed snake charmers (and fellow Vancouverites) of Frog Eyes as his backing band, and was apparently so tickled by the results that he has here attempted to bottle that genie for home use. Recorded over the course of a weekend (and entirely without Bejar's usual regard for subtlety) the new versions of these songs get fingered and manhandled to such degrees that those who love the verdant, extraterrestrial warmth of Your Blues might not want to look. Though Notorious Lightning finds Destroyer returning to a more traditional guitar-based instrumental line-up, this nevertheless feels like a riskier work than Your Blues, but unfortunately it seems to be one whose rewards don't merit the risk. With Frog Eyes guitarist and vocalist Carey Mercer serving as his primary foil, Bejar continually pushes his songs (not to mention his vocal chords) in directions they seem reluctant to go. The disk kicks off with the group stretching the spine of the titular ""Notorious Lightning"", giving the rousing Your Blues anthem a thorough electric going-over. Mercer's guitar spits long streams of tobacco juice over the verses before he and Bejar proceed to trade jabs and wounded howls for nearly 10 minutes. Like so many recent guitar-based tracks this bears certain similarities to Television, although I must say it's one of the few that I recall that seems interested in surpassing the reedy distress of Tom Verlaine's vocal delivery. This is a tactic that carries with it a needlessly high irritation factor, though to his credit (I guess) Bejar holds nothing back, continually squeezing his voice to its extremes with obvious emotive relish. Some of the other tracks-- such as the steam-rolling ""New Ways of Living"" or the Bowie-meets-the-Dead space blues of ""Don't Become the Thing You Hated""-- fare better in this harsh environment, although I don't know if any of them could necessarily be said to improve upon the Your Blues versions. Too often Bejar's bountiful hooks and deft lyrics get so buried beneath careless bluster that the uninformed newcomer might not even realize what they're missing. Longtime Destroyer followers are savvy enough not to expect Bejar to travel from point to point in a straight line, but for those just coming around to the ample charms of Your Blues, this unruly EP might prove to be one left turn too many.","Daniel Bejar reworks a half-dozen Your Blues tracks with help from Frog Eyes guitarist and vocalist Carey Mercer.

The Visible Sign of the Invisible Order,Master Musicians of Bukkake,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c537eb335119a49ed962/1:1/w_160/cc919ca7.gif,2005-01-27 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5626-the-visible-sign-of-the-invisible-order/,Abduction,"Sometimes an album sounds better if you don't know its artist's name or its song titles. Just Google ""bukkake"" and then pray for your mortal soul's destiny. The self-canceling album title doesn't help, and neither does the obligatory freakfolk vibe of songs titled ""Enter the Wang"", ""Hidden from the Hidden Ones"", or ""Pipestone Octopus with Horseheart"". If I never knew these fouls, then maybe I would consider the Master Musicians of Bukkake to be one haunting artifact unearthed from the crates of a Bangkok record shop/noodle house/bordello in the back. The Master Musicians is a motley assemble of 20 blokes from subterranean Seattle who generally perform lysergically poisoned impressions of Southeast Asian ceremonial music. Alan Bishop and Charlie Gocher of ethnodelic greats the Sun City Girls add some drums and Burmese banjo in there. Visible is best heard in one sitting as it follows a narrative from wearied peace to phantasmagoric horror to entrance to heaven. Opener, (cough, cough), ""Enter the Wang"" fires the gong with faint Asian pentatonic string scales letting everyone know that the curtains are drawn and much madness follows. ""Bukkake Sunrise"" first bleeds in what sounds like a cross being a machine eating a tape and rain on tin. Blues guitar melodies that overlook a dust bowl arise while tribal chants echo throughout, beckoning one out of slumber and tempting that person to crawl out his or her bedroom window to follow the sound. The earth then swallows up the seeker. ""Lucky Duck"" loosely recalls the Balinese monkey chant, as scattered Master Musicians arise from the ashes to curse in ululating chants all punctuated with tribal thumps. However, the melodrama kicks in with the following, ""Pipestone Octopus with Horseheart"" interrupts the album's flow with Residents-style orientialism with screeching and wails blown through the nose. The children's Halloween record vibe fares better on ""Horseheart Revolution"" and ""Black Bile"", where the chants are awash in the village fires. Midway through the LP, ""Hidden from the Hidden Ones"" gathers the delirium into a natural tension with a drum march to the sacrifice altar and Faust-like violin grindings driving the momentum. ""Custody's Last Battle/Secret Wars"" is the peak; gunshots pierce through an open-air recording as dribbling percussion and screamed ""aiees"" flee the battlefield. An obligatory catharsis, I suppose. Closer ""Circular and Made of the Earth"" resolves the whole delirium with a feel-good ballad of accordion drones and sitar-stylized banjos plucks in perfect tune with an enraptured bloke speaking in tongues. Cynics can consider this music to be another example of Westerners trying to be weird by exploiting ""exotic"" and ""mysterious"" Asian music. That accusation does have substantial evidence, but this music should not be dismissed so quickly. The majority of the music is still well-executed and can engross listeners with a sense of otherness. Just don't look up ""bukkake,"" for the love of God.","Seattle freakffolk collective perform ceremony music for a Southeast Asian netherworld. A few Sun City Girls perform a dance.

James transformed from an inconsistent but frequently mindblowing producer of electronic music into his scene's icon. As the interested came to know him, the man behind the Aphex Twin was a half-cracked mastermind who, unlike most out-there eccentrics in pop music mythology, managed to have the world by the balls. He sold his tracks to advertisements, bragged about shagging his French girlfriend, remixed for cash, and had modern music giants like Philip Glass ringing up his apartment/bank vault to arrange collaborations. Not that he could hear the phone-- he was too busy tooling around the countryside in his tank. Through all the craziness, James still found a way to channel the sound he heard in his head into records, at least one of which every listener seems to love. With his fascinating and often conveniently unverifiable backstory, he was a music critic's dream, sliding easily into deeply cut grooves where the genius is always young and the talent is irrepressible. One component of his legend has worked strongly in James' favor, particularly in the latter years: Because his childlike antics suggested he'd do anything for a laff, his work always contains at least one ""just kidding"" link in its DNA strand. So if a track sucked, it was, by default, because James was either lazy or having some fun-- not because he couldn't do better if he wanted to. After all, he has hundreds of brilliant tracks socked away somewhere that he can't be bothered to release. Why would he deliberately put out something that was just OK? Why, indeed? People wondered what James was up to after the 2001 release Drukqs, and there was some speculation that it was a contract fulfillment a la Prince's The Vault/Old Friends 4 Sale. It wasn't that Drukqs was bad, exactly, just that it seemed uninterested in breaking new ground, which was unusual considering the bold strokes to which the Aphex Twin audience had grown accustomed. James still did Aphex Twin better than anyone, but after his prolific 90s, that was no longer enough. Now, four quiet years later, he returns with a new series of 12-inches, dusting off his old Analogue Bubblebath handle AFX in honor of the vintage synths used to craft the Analord material. The records will be issued in 10 volumes, to be housed in a binder sold with the set. The key word for Analord is ""acid."" James has the archetypal gurgly 303 working overtime throughout, crunching out the melody on the upbeat ""Where's Your Girlfriend?"", letting the layered tendrils of squelch crawl over each other like a pit of electric-powered snakes in the mid-track breakdown. The bouncier ""Grumpy Acid"" fulfils the promise of its excellent title by sounding like the amplified gastric system of a robot badly in need of Pepto Bismol. ""Steppingfilter 101"" is mid-tempo mellow, with gentle synth pads floating behind the zig-zag buzz out front. It's a seriously retro sound, channeling precisely one offshoot of early ""classic"" IDM. If an unknown had released the tracks on Analord 1 in 1995, he would have been accused of straight ripping the AFX acid style. But James pioneered this sound, so I guess he has the right to return to it if he chooses. Analord 2 is a little better, keeping the same palate while toning down the tired acid textures and delivering more melody. The tuneful ""Phonatacid"" isn't exactly riveting, but it does manage to undergo some interesting transformations over its nearly 10-minute length. ""Laricheard"" references the famed Chicago house pioneer Larry Heard in its title but is the most drifting and contemplative track here. It all sounds nice enough, but no one introduced to James with these tracks would be compelled to investigate further. It's possible that as additional volumes of Analord are issued, these initial records will make sense in the larger context. Perhaps this is the Back to the Future phase of the project, where James revisits where he's been with AFX before taking us somewhere new. More than anything it's difficult to believe that the hyperactive and easily bored James could have kept himself entertained working on these pieces, which boldly go where so many (most notably the man himself) have gone before.",,5.6,
I Sold Gold,Aqueduct,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b49d034d5c69bf2a07/1:1/w_160/a4d128a9.jpg,2005-01-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/465-i-sold-gold/,Barsuk,"On I Sold Gold, a first-person scatter of cynical asides, relationship demands, and childhood memories inform the lyrics of Aqueduct principal David Terry's frail, fractured, push-button pop songs. ""I've lived my life so well/ But you put me through hell,"" he says in ""The Unspeakable"", and a piano's droopy chording is joined by random electronic noise and some skeletal live drumming. It's like he's walking through Guitar Center in Seattle, and all around him the demo programs and drum machines triggered by curious customers form into raggedy and rudimentary, but ultimately pretty clever little soundtracks of his life. In the store's backroom, a pimply teenage kid pecks eagerly at his first Hamer, and that scratchy whine becomes the intro to ""The Suggestion Box"". Terry harmonizes with himself to give the arguing words a plaintive edge. ""Hardcore Days & Softcore Nights"" doesn't live up lyrically to its like-gold title. But the track was addictive enough for those track jacket-lovin' kids on ""The O.C."", and its squelchy bump sounds here like Grandaddy covering Archers of Loaf. ""Heart Design"" is I Sold Gold's seven-layer cake of Casiotone twitter; ""Laundry Baskets"" matches that fuzz to rowdy guitars; and the wistful, faux theremin instrumental ""Gameover: Thanks for Playing"" is like closing time at the roller rink. Gold is Aqueduct's first full-length for Barsuk, and it fits snugly on a roster rife with groups (Long Winters, Rilo Kiley) that crosshatch indie rock with outside influences and, most significantly, an attention to melody. Terry turns in ""Frantic (Roman Polanski Version)"", and its upbeat, simplistic rush is a template for Pacific Northwest indie. But ""Five Star Day"", ""Unspeakable"", and ""Growing Up With GNR"" are smarter, mostly because of prominent piano melodies that connect them to the swaying AM pop of a past era. Okay, Terry is self-involved, neurotic, and noncommittal-- all traits common to love connections in the 21st century. And those feelings contribute to I Sold Gold's occasional detachment, like Terry's singing through a cell phone as he walks through that noisy Guitar Center. But its flimsiness usually finds a way to sound purposeful, and that makes Aqueduct's personal, cerebral pop worth coming back to.","Barsuk's other ""O.C.""-approved band offers up another round of their fractured push-button pop.

A Way of Life,Suicide,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a09d034d5c69bf3340/1:1/w_160/b7d71e01.jpg,2005-01-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7558-a-way-of-life/,Wax Trax!Wax Trax!,"Funnily enough, Suicide are victims of themselves. Their 1977 debut album is so ridiculously unique, innovative, and influential that it's easy to forget that they've made other records. For all the praise given to ""Frankie Teardrop"" and ""Cheree"", there's respectful silence regarding most of the rest of their catalog, as if to say ""yeah, that's okay, but you heard the debut, right?"" This is sad not only because it boxes Alan Vega and Martin Rev into one tiny corner of their career in most people's minds, but also because the other albums are actually pretty damn good. Forgoing a missive on why their second (also self-titled) album is just as good as their first, I'll cut to the chase at hand and announce that if A Way of Life had been their debut-- even in 1988 when it was originally released-- people would be talking about it every bit as much as they do the real debut. By the time it came out-- more than 10 years removed from their debut-- Suicide's influence had spread throughout the dance and industrial music scenes, with plenty of spillage into synth-pop and punk, but no one had yet managed to sound anything like them. Indeed, if there's one thing A Way of Life drives home more than any other, it's that Suicide never stopped being ahead of their time, their signature big-reverb synth-pop/50s rock 'n' roll/industrial noise melange (would you hate me if I coined the term droneabilly?) too singular to be touched by anyone else. Alan Vega's Elvis Presley-imprisoned-at-Vlad the Impaler's-house croon is a big part of what sets them apart, his tortured balladeer groaning and punky swagger rendering him a more dynamic frontman than just about any other act in any of the genres Suicide helped give birth to. One-man-band Martin Rev, meanwhile, makes artificiality into a virtue with his spot-on arrangements that alternately crawl and get on the good foot, frequently suggesting 28th Century doo-wop and rockabilly. A Way of Life puts their range on full display, pouring all of their evil energy into nine creepily ingratiated industrial pop songs, augmented on the reissue's second disc by a freaktacular live performance at London's Town & Country from 1987 that features material from each of their first three albums. The specifics don't really do it justice, but ""Surrender"" is the perfect prom theme for Twin Peaks High, a glowing 50s ballad replete with gauzy, ethereal female backing harmonies, Vega at his most Dean Martin (if Dean Martin were into S&M;) and ""Earth Angel"" guitar arpeggios transposed to the synths. ""Jukebox Baby 96"" is the most explicit rockabilly track, and if the Stray Cats played a note-for note cover of Rev's cleverly detailed arrangement, not one of those notes would sound out of place. The crackling and buzzing mechanics and thwacking beats of ""Rain of Ruin"", meanwhile are less novel, and Rev's machines couple with Vega's clipped vocalizations to sound almost Wire-ish on ""Dominic Christ"", bass line bending and warping over an insistent electro beat. When measured against their fist two albums, A Way of Life might be the runt of the litter, but it's still a very good, well-developed album, and now that it's back with a lengthy, mid-fi, but spirited live performance attached, fans really don't have much excuse for ignoring it.","Released more than 10 years after their debut, Suicide's third LP is often cruelly overlooked. A recent Mute reissue aims to redeem its reputation.

Purple Haze,Cam’ron,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7279d034d5c69bf370a/1:1/w_160/1ad8e81f.jpg,2005-01-26 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1791-purple-haze/,Roc-A-Fella,"Less than a week after the early-December release of Purple Haze, Jay-Z became the president of Def Jam Records, and that company made arrangements to seize control of Roc-A-Fella Records, the subsidiary that Jay started with his onetime friend Damon Dash. Dash left the label completely, announcing his plans to start another label called Roc-4-Life. Cam'ron, Dash's friend and one of Roc-A-Fella's flagship artists, attempted to leave the label as well, saying that Roc-A-Fella hadn't given Purple Haze an adequate promotional push-- which is strange considering the album had been in stores for less than a week. Cam's departure from Roc-A-Fella is still in doubt. But if he isn't contractually obligated to stick it out with Def Jam, this is the end of an era-- a time when a word-twisting surrealist amoral prince had the resources of rap's most successful imprint at his disposal-- and Purple Haze is its last document. Purple Haze creates its own world both sonically and lyrically. The beats range from wistful chipmunk soul to oppressive, stripped-down, bell-rattling NWA jacks to hypnotic, muted electro bounce. But whether the producers are dishing out the swirling operatic vocals of ""Killa Cam"" or the chopped-up hair metal guitars of ""Bubble Music"", they add up to a frozen, prismatic creep, a slow, hard, cinematic bed for Cam's magnetic flow. And Cam's flow is a thing of beauty. His bored, arrogant voice rolls syllables around until he's hit just about every possible permutation, transforming hard consonants into thrown rocks and idly toying with drug metaphors like they're Rubik's Cubes. In Cam's world, he's the king of Harlem, moving kilos, dispatching foes, and throwing around money with Machiavellian cool. Cam has the warped eloquence of an MF Doom even when he's bragging about violence (""Observe, cock, and spray/ We hit you from a block away/ Drinking saki on a Suzuki in Osaka Bay"") or conspicuous consumption (""I park in the towaway zone, chrome/ I don't care; that car a throwaway, homes""). Occasionally, he veers off into pure gibberish: ""Wreckx-N-Effect, zoom zoom, poon poon/ Since the movie Cocoon, had the Uzi platoon."" The ugliness of Cam's world is never more evident than when he's talking about women: ""Any girl I get, I totally open 'em/ Brain and they legs, cokin' and dopin' 'em"". Cam's misogyny comes through the speakers like a slap; it's jarring and frightening and sad. But Cam isn't heartless; a few of the songs have an air of weary lamentation, like Tony Soprano driving home after killing his cousin, wondering how it came to this: ""I give you a earful, it's tearful/ Told my mother I hustle, and she said, 'Be careful'. Purple Haze is like a Takeshi Kitano gangster movie; every moment of transcendent musical or linguistic beauty is shadowed by the spectre of death, an end so inevitable that Cam doesn't even let it get to him anymore. There's no sense of joy or exhilaration in his spending and shooting and fucking, but it's the only thing he knows.","Backed by beats ranging from wistful chipmunk soul to oppressive, bell-rattling NWA jacks and hypnotic electro bounce, Cam'ron bids adieu to Roc-A-Fella.

Before the Dawn Heals Us,M83,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdffc0084474cd0c2dfe/1:1/w_160/613dcf19.jpg,2005-01-26 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5009-before-the-dawn-heals-us/,MuteGooom,"Although critics consistently nudge away the term, M83 create high-concept emo embossed with glittery snow angels, packing more synthy bombast than a Tangerine Dream/Mineral mash-up. 2003's Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts found the duo lazing on their backs in an Antibes field, watching stars and birds gently collide above green mountain tops. A pleasingly disembodied traipse through the French countryside, it was a lesson for anybody who thinks electronics have no soul. After saying ""au revoir"" to longtime friend/collaborator Nicolas Fromageau, Anthony Gonzalez goes it alone for album three, upping the drama (there's even a track called ""Teen Angst"") by layering electro-acoustic sci-fi backdrops atop often-campy dialogue (written by his brother), and then buoying it all with by a massive noir choir. From the buzzing nighttime Blade Runner skyline of the cover art to lyrics investigating car wrecks and dislodged brains, this is a mammoth collusion of synth gasps and distorted swirls, darker and more urban than its meadow-bound predecessor. If Gonzalez had gone ahead with only epic Vangelis modulations, Before the Dawn Heals Us would collapse under hollow ponderousness. Instead, he weaves a rock backbone into his tangerine-dream landscape with steady doses of highly effective live drums, gigantic post-MBV guitar, and sharper, more defined songwriting that helps to beef up the diaphanous symphony. As those familiar with the group would expect, the icy Sigur Rós estuaries and incidental glaciers are ably glorious (as are the commingling interludes, tentative minimalist pairings with children's voices, drifting sound-streams, and assorted channel surfs), but the larger success belongs to denser, more propulsive Kevin Shields-style hooks. Launching amid the urgent, ghostly sighs of ""Tina"" draped over a frantic drum/synth meltdown, ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"" is a coiled bit of apocalyptic pop compulsion with a J.G. Ballard storyline: ""A piece of brain in my hair/ The wheels are melting."" Also built on rock'n'roll, ""Fields, Shorelines, and Hunters"" punts a precipitous Milky Way barnstorm of cascading feedback, drum buildups, and vocal cut-ups that lead into the even headier ""*"", which breaks orbit, uncoiling the previous track's static energy with a patch of cathartic shoegaze glaciers from Saturn. (If you close your eyes, you might feel like you're levitating.) Still, however cathartic, these baroque bursts will more than likely overwhelm listeners pragmatic and/or cynical enough to reject the purple poetry of a John Hughes first kiss or a flitting cliffside Robert Smith love note. It's interesting that M83 don't receive the same sort of ""vainglorious"" tag as Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes. Borrowing a page from Oberst, Gonzalez even opens the new record with a dramatic monologue: Languid drum rolls and chiming guitar/key-drifts pile up alongside a breathy ""They say I made the moon"" spoken by American actress Kate Moran, and culminating in ""raise your arms the highest they can, so the whole universe will glow."" Which, really, is what Gonzalez attempts to do over the course of these 15 tracks. (As we later learn, closing your eyes could perhaps kill the sun). But where Oberst sounds out of place on Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, Gonzalez confidently weds ones and zeros, forgoing millennial chilliness for depth and color. Which is one of a million reasons why Gonzalez is hard to frame. Not exactly a singer/songwriter or a dance-floor hero, Gonzalez is less about shoegazing or rock-boy myopia than the unbounded and gargantuan romanticism of a Vincent-Gallo-esque auteur: Entering the realm of M83 is less about Mogwai-esque post-rock than it is about going along with the ebbs and flows of Gonzalez's nearly faceless otherworldly flights of fancy. As with most ambitious undertakings, there are dull spots and moments when the dialogue, sentiments, or other indulgences can try a listener's patience. But more often than not, Gonzalez strikes gold, admirably upping the ante from the subtler Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts and creating a massive, teeming, gaudy edifice that at its best dazzles like its own misty solar system. And even when it implodes, the unintentional fireworks of its collapse create compelling, stunning patterns that leak like colored ink through the nocturnal cloud cover. ","Saying ""au revoir"" to longtime friend and collaborator Nicolas Fromageau, Anthony Gonzalez goes it alone for M83's third LP, a mammoth collusion of synth gasps and distorted swirls that's darker and more urban than its meadow-bound predecessor, Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts.

The Great Destroyer,Low,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd89c0084474cd0c2d0f/1:1/w_160/3b55b461.jpg,2005-01-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4902-the-great-destroyer/,Sub Pop,"""The future is prisms and math,"" Alan Sparhawk sings on ""Death of a Salesman"", one of the few successful tracks from The Great Destroyer. Any English professor will tell you it's dangerous to conflate an author with his narrator, but in this case, there are parallels to draw. Think of the prism as this statement from the band's online bio (written circa Secret Name): ""Low is a trio from Duluth, Minnesota, who make very slow music. That's not the only thing there is to their music, or even the most important thing, but it's what you'll notice first."" Anyone that's listened to myopic negative criticism of the group knows this all too well. The bio goes on to note that there's more to Low music than narcoleptic tempos; indeed, you'd have to be tone-deaf or stubborn to listen to Secret Name or Songs From a Dead Pilot and not realize that. Still, the stereotype remains-- as do expectations from fans of all stripes, whether the band wants to cop to them or not. Most importantly, there's the expectations that the band has of themselves; over the past decade, the group has shown a willingness to buck convention and follow their muse wherever it leads. Unfortunately, it sounds like they've been lead astray. In other words (again, from ""Death of a Salesman""): ""I forgot all my songs/ The words now are wrong/ And I burned my guitar in a rage"". This forgetful rage is exemplified by ""Everybody's Song"", one of the album's many missteps. On this song, the group rocks out-- Sparhawk breaks out the Spinal Tap amp, Mimi Parker pummels her snare and high-hat, and Zak Sally...well, Zak doesn't have to change his approach too much, though he might be plucking his bass strings with more force than usual. On top of this mess are those patented gorgeous two-part harmonies, uncharacteristically straining to make themselves heard over the racket. And that's what this track amounts to-- a big ball of racket, crass and boorish, full of the sound and fury that don't amount to much. More importantly, it goes against everything that Low does successfully. Don't take my word for it, though. According to Low, ""they play songs stripped to their bare essentials: slow tempos, quiet voices, powerful lyrics, and minimal instrumentations."" You'd think that a song following that plan of attack would be a smashing success, or-- at the very least-- a bit better than this Marshall Stacked stuff. Instead, they end up with a song bastard naysayers can use as Hater's Exhibit A in the case of Why Low Is No Good. ""Broadway (So Many People)"", an interminable seven-minute track, takes its sweet time alternating between bored lead-footed strumming and waning echoed ambiance before giving way to a cloying coda that aims for ""pretty"" but ends up well in the rough. The rest of the album consists of various extrapolations of Low's sound with varying degrees of success. ""Monkey"", the lead-off track, is what ""Everybody's Song"" would be with just a smidge of restraint, a better sense of dynamics, and some self-awareness. Following that is ""California"", probably the best pop song the group's ever recorded (with the meta-aware ""Just Stand Back"" and the peppy Spector homage ""Walk Into the Sea"" finishing close behind). On the other hand, there are Low-by-numbers tracks like ""On the Edge Of"" (working the quiet/loud trick like a broken light switch) and over-wrought slabs like ""Step"" (complete with vocal effects, piano taps, hand claps, and children's vocals all drunkenly stumbling into each other), where the busy hands of producer Dave Fridmann still end up doing the Devil's work. Erring on the side of minimal instrumentation would have done this record a world of good. ""Cue the Strings"" would play out beautifully as just Mimi & Alan set against a sea of feedback, but the invasive metronomic beat and the fake strings (popping in on cue) muddy the waters; the all tension/no release moves of ""Pissing"" is the slightly more successful flip side to ""Everybody's Song"" and its all release/no tension MO; ""Silver Rider"" pays too much attention to its own edict (""Sometimes your voice is not enough"") and adds just enough bells and whistles-- a timpani drum here, a buried looped vocal there, some acoustic picking sprinkled throughout-- to upset the song's balance; ""When I Go Deaf"" works fine as a quiet acoustic number but loses a bit of its emotional heft when the full band comes in and the guitar tech plugs in Sparhawk's Flying V. ""The future is prisms and math."" So let's crunch some numbers: Low's been an ongoing concern for over a decade. The Great Destroyer is their 8th album, and 12th full-length release. They've recorded enough songs during the course of their career to fill a three-CD box set with a set of 52 songs that barely overlaps what's available on their full-lengths. And never mind the number of tours and shows and hours logged in countless studios. I mention all this because of the intriguing subtext permeating most of these songs. It's in the song titles--""Death of a Salesman"", ""When I Go Deaf"", ""Cue The Strings"", ""Walk Into The Sea"". It's in the lyrics--""never sing that song again,"" ""the march is over/ The great destroyer/ She passes through you like a knife,"" ""Yeah, time's a great destroyer/ It leaves every child a bastard."" And, most tellingly, on ""Just Stand Back"": ""I could turn on you so fast/ I'll just cut you in the end."" Sounds like they're cutting bait and heading back to shore. You can imagine a wry smirk on Alan's face when he sings: ""It's a hit/ It's got soul/ Steal the show/ With your rock'n'roll"". It's a wry encapsulation of a band that's made a point (up until now) to forgo convention, instead setting off to discover a new dialect in an old language. This line could easily serve as an epithet, or an epitaph. And maybe this is a death, and The Great Destroyer is Low themselves, orphaning their fans and their history for the sake of the group's creative edification. If this album is indeed the beginning of a long, arduous journey of rediscovery and rebirth and other fun ponderous stuff, here's hoping the rest of the trip is more enjoyable than this initial misstep.","For their Dave Fridmann-produced Sub Pop debut, veteran slowcore band Low expand their palette, but achieve varying degrees of success.

Girls of War,Die Monitr Batss,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9fea9e61561daa72a7/1:1/w_160/9e524630.jpg,2005-01-25 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2593-girls-of-war/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Calling Girls of War an album is misleading; this is a paid rehearsal for a hack band. Big Black EPs, Flipper's ""Sex Bomb"", and No New York are convenient but unrealized inspirations: Drummer Chris (first name only, plz) pounds the toms but the smoke never rises, screamster slash guitarist Brace Pain runs his fingers haphazardly up and down the fretboard, and saxophonist Nate-- who apparently plays without a reed or lips-- fidgets nervously until Brace gives him the nod to make some noise. A few beats in, Brace starts demanding destroy all rats before suddenly ending the song with a 20-second instrumental shitstorm. Congrats, Batss, you just cut Track 6. Noise-rocking Hammerhead guitarist Paul Sanders not-very-famously said: ""I remember sometimes when I felt like when we played it was like surfing a big sonic wave. That's the feeling I associate with 'noise'. When it worked, it was transcendent. When it didn't, it was just difficult and annoying."" A third adjective Sanders could include is ""boring"": And Girls of War-- despite how loud, fast, and artfully seat-of-pants it wants to seem-- is exactly that. No one's expecting straightforward hooks from a groove-oriented noise band (Die Monitr Batss insist they're not dancepunk), but something needs to sustain the listener's interest. Hooks in noise and no wave aren't exhausted: check recently the hypnotic chant of Liars' ""Broken Witch"", or that throbbing, condensed bass line of Wolf Eyes' ""Stabbed in the Face"". Die Monitr Batss, on the other hand, indiscriminately hurl up chunks of sound, hoping that something sticks. On ""Heatersss"", a microcosm of the entire album's fallacy, Pain exhibits the same instrumental banalities that hampered the music of his other band The Gossip. The track starts promising; a spastic Primus bass pattern pops under scrawling pick scrapes, pausing briefly for subtle guitar harmonics. Suddenly though Pain begins his drivel-- ""He said he never wants to see you again/ Turn on the heater, I'm freezing""-- and the band resorts to punk guitar clichés like octave riffing and legato bends, ending the song in a diarrheic mess of more pick scrapes and thoughtless high-hat fills. While some of the album's finer moments reflect the fractured, primitive stylings of DNA (""White Shock"") or the lugubrious breakdowns of early Sonic Youth [""Catholic Guilt (At Night)""], the vast majority of Girls of War suffers from immature lyrics, punk gimmicks that masquerade as meaningful musical confrontation-- and spelling errors.","These Troubleman United punks hurl up chunks of sound, hoping that something sticks.

Emoh,Lou Barlow,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47bea9e61561daa4efb/1:1/w_160/d370be33.jpg,2005-01-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1149-emoh/,Merge,"Given the amount of material that Lou Barlow has issued under sometimes misleading monikers (Sebadoh, Sentridoh, The Folk Implosion, The New Folk Implosion, Lou's Wasted Pieces...), it's sort of odd to consider this record-- the first released under his full name-- his solo debut. Barlow has recorded countless songs at a prolifc rate, paying little attention to recording (and, arguably, any other kind of) quality. Barlow writes songs like some people smoke cigarettes or pick their nose: Compulsively, and without regard to who's paying attention. However, Emoh is the most consistently strong record he's released since The Folk Implosion's One Part Lullaby-- and it could be his most melodic: There's no tape hiss, awkward count-off's, dialogue, or noise experiments here. Even if much of it was recorded at home, Emoh's 14 unassuming folk songs sound like they were created in a professional setting. The album moves in whiter shades of pale lullabies, between acoustic grunge-lite (""Caterpillar Girl""), private backroom square-dances (""Holding Back the Year"", ""If I Could""), and traditional story songs like ""Mary"", a clever jibe at Christian folklore (""Immaculate conception/ Yeah, right"") written from the POV of the real babydaddy-- he and Mary saved from retribution by history's (supposedly) most infamous lie. As melancholy or as victimized as Barlow has painted himself in the past, it's possible that all this time he just wanted to write campfire sing-alongs about his cats (see ""The Ballad of Daykitty""). Sounding as direct and spontaneous as a living-room rehearsal for friends, these songs don't pretend to be much more. The instrument that gets the most attention is Barlow's own voice. Whether it's the recording quality or just increased confidence, his voice is stronger and deeper here than on any of his earlier work, and self-harmonizing occurs frequently-- even dominating many of these songs. There are a few holdovers from his lo-fi past: ""Holding Back the Year"" closes with some sloppy vibrato from a lead guitar, and a Casio keyboard blurts out a solo in ""Monkey Begun"". But along with the occasional use of drum loops, these touches are used clinically and sparingly, only to add a bit of color to the otherwise spartan arrangements. For better or for worse, we're left with a little acoustic guitar and a whole lotta Lou. Perhaps then that's why most of these songs never seem to rise above a whisper. The bubbling electro-folk of ""Home"" manages to stand above the rest, but while this new batch of songs is pleasant and often charming, they're not as memorable or passionate as Barlow's best. Emoh is a record that will please longtime fans-- and maybe bring back a few he's lost.","After years of mostly solo projects, the indie legend releases his first LP under his own name.

Eveningland,Hem,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c166abf31b7dc71565fc/1:1/w_160/85637fc9.jpg,2005-01-25 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3994-eveningland/,RounderWaveland,"Sure, ""countrypolitan"" is as good a term as any to describe Hem's music-- assuming you know what that term implies. Countrypolitan is the area where the yarn-spinning twang-loving country mouse and the pop-savvy champagne-sipping city mouse can break brie and listen to outtakes from the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. And the way in which Hem's songwriters (multi-instrumentalists Dan Messé, Gary Maurer, and Steve Curtis) can set a scene with just a few choice words or images and a mix of pedal steel and fiddle would make even the most respected set designers and directors envious. Fittingly for something so cinematic, this album was recorded on Dreamworks' dime before that label went belly-up. It's a good thing, too-- I assume Rounder would need to push a lot more Alison Krauss records across cashier countertops before being able to justify flying Hem to Europe to work with the Slovak National Radio Orchestra. Each song on Eveningland acts as a tightly-blocked one-scene short film, from the sleepy suburban sunset (""across a gingham sky"") in ""Receiver"" to the lonely and wet pavement in ""Pacific Street"" (""I don't know you except in the way/ A traveler knows a traveler""); from the simple sadness of ""My Father's Waltz"" (""May this night keep you here till tomorrow"") to the rush of fear and exhilaration of ""Redwing"". Even without words, Hem paint a vivid picture-- the burgeoning rush and relenting ebb of strings and woodwinds on the title track would mesh perfectly with time-lapsed photography of a forest bedding down for the night, while banjo and fiddle make ""Cincinnati Traveler"" a wistful vignette of a tourist's arrival in a strange city. When words are in the picture, though, they're placed in good hands. Whether conveying the conflicting emotions that come with the discovery of love (as in ""Redwing"") or solemnly confessing fears and shortcomings (as in the hymn-like ""Strays""), Sally Ellyson's voice remains pristine and powerful. It's a power evident in even the quieter, softer moments-- she warbles softly through ""My Father's Waltz"", sometimes even disappearing, but it's a devastating performance, effortlessly carrying the song's emotional heft. Equally devastating is the album's hidden, closing track, ""Now The Day Is Over"", a traditional folk song sung acapella. The stark contrast between the album's lush orchestration and this song's nudity is jarring, and the tremble in Ellyson's voice lends a fearful air to the lyrics. This isn't to say that Hem are humorless. Exhibit A: ""Jackson"", a song probably best remembered for Johnny and June Carter Cash's duet on At Folsom Prison. In the hands of the Cashes, it's a playful rollicking tune about a man going down to Jackson to ""mess around"" and his woman making sure the door hits him in the ass on the way out: ""Go on down to Jackson, go on and wreck your health"" -- and don't mind her if she throws all your stuff out into the yard when you leave town, you good-for-nothin' so-and-so. The way Hem plays it-- with a slower tempo and some twinkling glockenspiel dusting the strings-- the woman becomes implicit in this tawdry seduction. She's beckoning her man to come down to Jackson in a playful manner (""Play your hand, you big talkin' man/ Make a big fool of yourself""), coyly taunting him. Sure, she'll still be dancing on a pony keg-- that's about 22 liters-- and he'll still be walking around like a wounded hound, but there's no longer a sense of broken furniture and slammed doors. Indeed, Hem's songs-- no matter how bleak-- project a hope and buoyancy that would grate were it not for their deftness and skill. Even with the murder balladry of ""Carry Me Home""-- ""So me and Jessie, we left Ohio/ We left him bleeding on the valley floor""-- there's hope to be had. When Ellyson repeatedly sings, ""Tell me nothing's wrong here,"" it's not an accusatory order; it's a gentle, comforting request that knows that everything will be all right as the music comes to an end and the curtains close.","Hem's cinematic and frequently gorgeous countrypolitan sound was nearly lost in the post-Dreamworks shuffle.

Touch / Speicher 2,Michael Mayer,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b05e6ef9596931ffef/1:1/w_160/991544a8.jpg,2005-01-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11781-touch-speicher-2/,Kompakt,"Michael Mayer's gift for the definitive statement has made him a worthy figurehead for microhouse. Sure, it helps that he owns Kompakt Records, but his expertly constructed mixes are so authoritative and lean that they read like blue-sky distillations of a point in time; he's one of few DJs who can communicate the full-bodied landscape of a scene and meditate on its past and future possibilities in the span of 70 minutes. But despite being responsible for two such landmark mixes in 2002's Immer and 2003's Fabric 13, Mayer's original material has heretofore been consigned to 12-inches. Lost amidst the glut of pre-holiday releases last December, Touch is the full-length debut he has reportedly labored over for years. Dissatified with the album's many previous incarnations, Mayer recorded this final version over a three-week burst last summer; with its light, August atmospheres and simple, elementary sounds, Touch communicates the natural environment in which it was made. It also sounds like it was hatched in a relatively short timeframe, which is no bad thing-- where Mayer's studio mixes have been assembled with a painstakingly precise, scissor-cut aesthetic, Touch generally feels rounder, more casual and certainly more homemade. Of the eight tracks, only one-- the wispy ""Lovefood""-- contains vocals. The rest range from the by-the-books techno of atmosphere-setting opener ""Touch"" to the proggy (translation: epic and undanceable) no man's land of the album centrepiece ""Slowfood"". But, a few highlights notwithstanding (both ""Heiden"" and the previously released ""Amabile"" ooze slow-cooked energy), Touch never achieves liftoff, nor does it ever really threaten to. Instead, it just kind of blissfully floats around in its own self-contained environment, content to prettily fizzle out into an unceremonious anti-climax. Mixed a few months prior, Speicher 2 comprises tracks mostly culled from Kompakt Extra's Speicher series, and shows Mayer the clinician at his best. With a small pool of strong source material to select from, Mayer's job is admittedly a lot easier here. As ever, he reveals himself to be a master of momentum, easing into the mix with dark rumblers like Wighnomy Brothers' ""Wurz + Blosse"", Wolfgang Voigt's ""Nachschub"", and the bubbling techno of his own brilliant ""X"". Thirty minutes down the line, he's dutifully moved on to bangers like Freiland's prickly ""Jens Harke Mix"", the schaffel stomp of Fuschsbau's ""Null/Eins"", and Naum's spangly ""Ari""-- the final track in another functionally and technically sound set. Like Touch, at times Speicher 2 suffers underneath the weight of Mayer's past achievements-- or maybe that's just microhouse beginning to show diminishing returns. But even if neither of these records ultimately match up to Kompakt's finest, they're still welcome outings, and proof that Mayer is the rare leader from whom ""more of the same"" is still a welcome proposition.","Kompakt records boss mixes another series of Speicher releases and finally issues his debut studio LP.

So Jealous,Tegan and Sara,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a898c0084474cd0c0e6d/1:1/w_160/8c9f0e78.jpg,2005-01-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8285-so-jealous/,VaporSanctuary,"Great pop songs should be more than the sum of a few entertaining parts. So much ""pop/rock"" of the past 10 years studies the Dave Matthews songwriting handbook: Cram as many marketable hooks as possible into three minutes, coherence be damned. Thus when Rob Thomas and Santana teamed up for ""Smooth"", you may not have felt anything, but you probably can still hum one of its cotton candy fragments. Canadian power-pop duo Tegan and Sara take a similar approach, tossing around seemingly unrelated, radio-ready banalities over predictable power chords throughout their latest LP, So Jealous. There's really no reason why these identical twins shouldn't be huge. Their songs fuse Ashlee Simpson mall-punk with the retro 80s fetish of former tourmate Ryan Adams' recent high-profile stinker. Still, I can't spare So Jealous the critical scalpel just because it's inexplicably below the mainstream radar. Co-producers John Collins (New Pornographers) and David Carswell (Smugglers) are no excuse, either. Collins and Carswell helped turn Tegan and Sara's early Lilith Fair folk into Alanis Morissette-style pop/rock on 2002's If It Was You, and their latest work takes the transformation a step further, incorporating some trendy new-wave influences. Former Weezer bassist Matt Sharp even takes a break from his recent Mark Hollis-tinged solo work to turn in some vintage Rentals synth lines. No matter, because the over-compression so common in self-consciously commercial rock these days renders each instrument as nuanced as Hannity & Colmes. The first single from So Jealous, ""Walking With a Ghost"", sounds like one of those dummy mp3s major labels post on KaZaA to fool unsuspecting music lovers, where the first 10 seconds loop for five minutes. Remember when you thought ""House of Jealous Lovers"" was instrumental? ""Walking With a Ghost"" repeats three or four mundane phrases-- particularly ""out of my mind""-- dozens of times in two-and-a-half-minutes, all over the same jerky, studio-polished guitar chords. I suppose it's almost as catchy as the latest McDonalds jingle, but it's also utterly boring. The album's best song is the energetic ""Speak Slow"", with its peppy ""ah-ah"" chorus. But even that hook wears out its welcome by the seventh or eighth go-round. Tegan and Sara are lauded for their lyrics, but languorous ballad ""Fix You Up"" touches on boy-band terrain: ""This love is all I have to give."" I save my most mordant chuckles for the song that transposes the riff from Cat Power's ""Free"": ""We Didn't Do It for the Money"". Protesting a little much, aren't we?","Canadian indie pop twins trade in power chords and 80s retro.

Naturally,Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4babf31b7dc7155a60/1:1/w_160/dc73f9bb.gif,2005-01-24 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4355-naturally/,Daptone,"While the second grade assemblies chant the first two verses of ""This Land Is Your Land"" in the multipurpose rooms of elementary schools from suburbia to the inner-cities, Sharon Jones struts across the virgin American land and into the welfare office with Woody Guthrie in arm. The Dap-Kings-- the ace house band for Brooklyn heavy-funk revivalist label Daptone-- concocts a heavy-funk groove that saunters each step, twists in place, and then glides forward to onlookers' disbelief. Sitting in the office of Government Love is David Guy's trumpet that jitters in trying to keep a straight face, while saxmen Neal Sugarman and Otis Youngblood nudge his ribs. Tradition dictates every patriot must sing that song with a cornfed drawl to demonstrate he or she is thankful of the homestead lands that Uncle Sam gave away to his or her grandpappy, but Jones sings it like she's been promised everything and got nothing. In Aretha's ""don't you know?"" tone, she shoots each lyric as if in a cheatin' lover's ear. And then comes the verses erased in so many school songbooks: ""In the squares of the city/ In the shadow of the steeple/ Near the welfare office/ I see my people/ And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'/ If this land's still made for you and me."" Jones' second album, Naturally, is a testament to how much was lost in R&B; over the past decade. Her band's music and album covers may seem arcane if not retro, but there is an undeniable substance in a tradition bled dry from so many Boyz II Men, Mariah, and Babyface records. Instead of auto-piloted rimshots and faint piano melodies of bastardized Barry White soul, the Dap-Kings deliver high-fiber soul that recalls the best of the JB's, the Meters and countless garage bands who heard James Brown's call and recorded one-off 45s. Nary a gutbucket beat, horn blast, or chicken-scratched and honeycombed guitar riff are wasted; almost every melody and its haunting through hours both sleeping and awake, clicks. ""How Do I Let a Good Man Down?"" and ""Your Thing Is a Drag"" hiccups a groove that is nearly up there with the JB's classic trance, ""Give Me Some More"", as Jones belts out a melancholy that strikes between the eyes. Her songs mainly dwell on the ""he loves me/he loves me not"" premise that are so well sung that they evade cliche. ""My Man Is a Mean Man"" is a jaunt that runs from and then smacks up the wife-beater in question, while ""How Long Do I Have to Wait for You"" is a hit of sunshine that hypnotizes a noisenik like me. ""Believe me when I tell you/ I got the kind of love, baby/ That's going to make you higher than what you're dreaming of,"" she sings in the enchantment under the sea ballad, ""You're Gonna Get It"". This was made for you and me.","Neo-soul's coffeeshop world gets a blast of deep funk grooves.

How to Kill the DJ [Part Two],Optimo,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c454c0084474cd0c367b/1:1/w_160/67a7477f.gif,2005-01-24 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6106-how-to-kill-the-dj-part-two/,Kill the DJ,"It's considered an unassailable virtue to have eclectic taste in music. That's how most everyone likes to think of himself, as the person who likes a bit of everything (the good parts, presumably) and subconsciously understands musical connections that extend beyond the boundaries of genre, scene, or geography. The appeal is demonstrated in the story of early hip-hop, which-- as it's usually told-- is the story of DJs who would throw on whatever rocked the party, be it Aerosmith, Chic, or some uptight German dudes obsessed with robots who happened to be so stiff they were funky. This mythical late 70s/early 80s period can be seen as the DJ's Garden of Eden before the Fall (before serious money became involved, I guess), to which so many yearn to return. In practice, though, eclecticism in a DJ mix isn't always all its cracked up to be. If you've ever actually played music for a crowd of people gathered to have a good time to your selections, you know most of them aren't at all interested in the wild and crazy shit in your crate. One indulgent misstep and the dancers disappear faster than if someone lit a stinkbomb in the center of the floor. Most people who go out want to dance and feel good to something familiar, so club nights are accordingly designed to let them know what they're in for. Ultimately, the thing about the eclectic DJ set is that's it's really, really difficult to pull off. Without the parameters of a micro-scene to guide you, the DJ has to know his records backward and forward to understand how pieces cut from different saws might snap together. When it works, though, it's something. On the evidence of their first official mix CD, JD Twitch and JG Wilkes-- who since 1997 have been the resident DJs at the Glasgow club Optimo (Espacio)-- do diversity beautifully. How to Kill the DJ [Part Two]-- the sequel to Ivan Smagghe's excellent 2003 Tigersushi release-- is actually a two-disc set, with the first given over to a mashed-up approximation of the what the club sounds like in full swing, and the second containing 18 tracks representing what might play as people are filing in. This 75-minute continuous mix is a miracle of licensing, with 42 indexed tracks from 50+ artists, including big names like Love, Suicide, and Gang of Four, and many lesser-knowns familiar primarily to followers of a specific scene (Ricardo Villalobos, Loose Joints, Akufen). On paper it looks like an ADHD sort of mix, with many selections lasting only for 30 seconds or so, but the Optimo DJs generally keep the transitions smooth and have an uncanny knack for building bridges between disparate sounds. Keep an eye on the CD player and it's often surprising when one track ends and another begins. How to Kill the DJ is a true collage, where the tiniest musical fragment has a job to do. So the seven seconds of Basic Channel's ""Phylyps Track 2"" solo exists to connect the throbbing techno of Luciano and Quenum's ""Orange Mistake"" to the industrial synth pop of Crash Course in Science's early 80s track ""Flying Turns"", which then leads to a brief snippet of the Revolting Cocks' heavy ""On Fire"" and then the Superpitcher Schaffel mix of the Quarks' gothic/sleaze ""I Walk"". With all the uber-hip records flying around How to Kill the DJ never feels analytical or showy. So even when the pre-teens from the Langley Schools Music Project show up to do ""Good Vibrations"" in the middle of the CD, which would normally seem a guaranteed vibe-killer, the indulgent gesture feels earned. Besides, it's Twitch's set closer before he gives the decks up to Wilkes, and when the latter starts his set off with the insanely danceable D.C. go-go of ""The Word"" by the Junkyard Band, all is forgiven. If the first CD is an approximation of a club mix, the second comes across simply as a mix CD, the kind you or I might make for a friend. No themes are overt connections, just 18 tracks of music that hang together. Angelo Badalamenti's gorgeous and unsettling theme for Mullholland Drive opens, other highlights include Arthur Russell's ""Another Thought"", Lee Hazelwood and Nancy Sinatra's spooky ""Some Velvet Morning"", Sun City Girls' ""Opium Den"", and Os Mutantes' ""A Minha Menina"". It's a record collector's mix, no question, filled with tracks that have all been labeled ""cool"" at some point. But as a collection of good songs that sound great together on one CD, it's a convincing argument for the power of good taste. Combine that taste with skilled editing and you've every right to be as eclectic as you want to be.","This eclectic two-disc mix spans multiple decades and includes both the familiar and the underground-- all without being showy or keeping the listener at arm's length.

And the Black Moths Play the Grand Cinema / Jealousy and Diamond,Dean RobertsAutistic Daughters,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a314ea9e61561daa4bd0/1:1/w_160/b8e7f59f.jpg,2005-01-24 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11819-and-the-black-moths-play-the-grand-cinema-jealousy-and-diamond/,Ritornell,"You could compare the latest work of New Zealand's Dean Roberts to a band like Talk Talk, but not for the arrangements-- Roberts works with guitar and staticky laptop textures, a vaguer and more evasive medium than the chamber instruments of late Talk Talk-- or for his singing, although the rough vulnerability in his vocals may evoke Mark Hollis. The quality they share is that search for a spark in the darkness, where even repetetitive or abstract passages reveal a drive toward answers. It distinguishes Roberts' work and it illuminates the familiar materials that he employs. After starting his career in the noise-punk Thela, Roberts has evolved into a laptop and guitar improviser, a fixture in the New Zealand noise scene who travels the world to play art music festivals or to record for labels like Erstwhile and Staubgold; if you're a fan of Loren Connors, Oren Ambarchi, or Christian Fennesz, Roberts' work is up your alley. Reissued from its 2000 release, Roberts' And the Black Moths Play the Grand Cinema may be his strongest laptop work. Recorded in New York, it combines loops and staticky textures with live instruments, including contributions by Tim Barnes, Matt Valentine, and Charles Curtis. Roberts starts the record with a lo-fi buzzing that yields to Barnes' opening percussion and fragmentary vocals. From there, he intersperses brief songs-- including a stoically morbid cover of Brian Eno's ""Cindy Tells Me""-- with hypnotic clouds of loops that hover like lullabies for baby cyborgs. And while the first half of the record drifts in that vein, the second is fast and anxious, propelled by Barnes' percussion. The combination of live and electronic elements, the range of tones from distant to piercing and the significant shifts in tempo give a full expressiveness to a limited and potentially obtuse palette. (This is also a terrific soundtrack to play behind Half Life 2.) In the last two years, Roberts has cut two records for the American indie label Kranky that focus on his songcraft and increasingly eschew the laptop for live instrumentation. 2003's Be Mine Tonight was a moody warm-up for Jealousy and Diamond, which he recorded in Vienna with Werner Dafeldecker on bass and drummer Martin Brandlmayr of Trapist and Radian. Working under the name Autistic Daughters, the group is a spare cooperative trio, where every breath or brush of wire and wood makes an impact. Moody, beautiful, and meticulous, Jealousy and Diamond is divided into seven slow songs, with Roberts murmering above the close interaction of its players: this is slowcore played with the attention of improvisers, and it's completely engrossing. Yet its main shortcoming is its mood. Even when the band crashes into higher volumes, the prevailing atmosphere's bleak, and Roberts sings the skeletal lyrics like the blankets are too heavy to get out of bed. Like Grand Cinema, they include a pop cover, but their take on the Kinks' ""Rainy Day in June"" is dismal, and the end of the record almost peters out. Every thudded note on the bass still feels like a small step toward a goal, but the album could use more revelations to hold its fragile pieces together: though the search is the whole point, the audience could use signs that we're getting there.",,8.1,
Worlds Apart,...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09513d197565213840b/1:1/w_160/df5d82ed.jpg,2005-01-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/182-worlds-apart/,Interscope,"Did Source Tags & Codes deserve a 10.0? That's not for me to say, but Matt LeMay rightfully counted it as one of indie rock's truly epic albums. By now, ""epic"" has grown stretch marks-- the term is thrown around whenever tracks buy into a concept, or break up into movements, or simply push past four minutes. Really, to be epic is to have a grand purpose, a destiny, and to fulfill it-- not out of desire, but out of necessity. But necessity means struggle, and when I listen to ""Another Morning Stoner"" or ""Baudelaire"", I hear a band fighting to keep pace with its own colossal compositions. I hear a rhythm section buffeted by uncompromising tempos. I hear a gun held up to the head of Conrad Keely-- maybe the world's most terrible singer-- and a masked man telling him to sing pretty or die. It's not the band or the songs, but the curious life-or-death stakes by which the band played the songs that deserves the rating the album was awarded. Understandably, Austin's Trail of Dead didn't have a fucking clue what to do for a follow-up. On 2003's The Secret of Elena's Tomb EP, they tried reprising ST&C; (""All St. Day""), reverted to their early days as a Sonic Youth cover band (""Mach Schau""), and even turned in a poor man's ""Iris"" (""Counting Off the Days""). No band wants to hear it can't top itself-- an implication that shadowed every perfect rating ST&C; received critically-- and Trail of Dead seemed anxious to abandon their defining opus, which was already beginning to dwarf the band itself in importance. Worlds Apart is an aspiration, an apology, the sound of confusion. The Interscope tag continues to be Trail of Dead's biggest asset and affliction: The label allows them the freedom to distance themselves from their past achievements, and access to Jimmy Iovine's in-house PR machine, which can win the interest of major media conglomerates, commercial radio and MTV; but the band aims too high as a result, apparently convinced that they have the power to change pop culture from the inside, to engage the public with seemingly radio-safe rock stylings that actually conceal one deceitful, potentially winning twist. Unfortunately, for Worlds Apart, that twist is once-off gimmickry: hamfisted ""subversive"" lyrics, pointless pastiche, and outrageous self-parody. Count first single ""Worlds Apart"" among the thousands of boring three-minute commercial rock songs that-- get this-- criticize commercial rock. The lyric ""Look at these cunts on MTV with cars and cribs and shit/ Is that what being a celebrity means?"" is this palm-muted, mall-punk schmaltz-waltz's only surprise, passable on first listen and grating thereafter. It doesn't get laughable until the cursing kicks in-- essential to the band's ""points""-- and keeps the song off radio. In several website manifestos (since removed), Keely complained that music lovers consume songs without actually listening to them. He claimed we reduce albums to genre, and artists to their influences, uninterested in finding a song's meaning and unwilling to appreciate their unique human nuances. One such manifesto came packaged with promo copies of Worlds Apart, in fact, as if Keely could convince us to ignore the fact that ""The Summer of '91"" sounds like the Counting Crows, ""Let It Drive"" sounds like the Gin Blossoms, ""The Rest Will Follow"" sounds like Bright Eyes, ""All White"" sounds like Ziggy Stardust-era Bowie, and the verse melody of ""Caterwaul"" is the band's most soluble MBV-meets-Sonic Youth rip yet. Much of Worlds Apart plays like a boring mid-90s alt-rock radio mixtape-- so why sit through this shit just to get the band's ""jokes""? Here's the worst joke: Trail of Dead spend so much time being ""Worlds Apart"" from themselves and the pop culture they engage to overthrow that they only manage one good song. The album's least self-conscious cut, ""Will You Smile Again"", charges out with a mammoth 5/4 riff, loud and snarling and far more theatrical than the cartoonish ""Ode to Isis"". Keely sings poorly on ""Will You Smile Again"" as he does throughout Worlds Apart, but here he turns his biggest challenge into a compelling performance, letting the notes explode into untoned gutturals when they outstretch his range. The seven-minute song's not life-or-death stakes-- it's something bigger, something more confident, but for now a fleeting fancy. Seconds into the title track that follows, Trail of Dead follow a sample of children yelling ""YAY!"" with Keely sniping, ""HEY, FUCK YOU MAN""-- which, of course, makes the kids laugh. This easy switch-up-- kitschy but not considered, cunning but never heartfelt-- is the album's epitaph.","Austin-based rock heroes And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead follow the glorious noise and epic urgency of Source Tags & Codes with this sadly pompous, overreaching monstrosity.

All Harm Ends Here,Early Day Miners,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe7ea9e61561daa734c/1:1/w_160/727593a1.jpg,2005-01-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2657-all-harm-ends-here/,Secretly Canadian,"It's probably no coincidence that the cover of Early Day Miners' fourth album, All Harm Ends Here, depicts a verdant, upward-reaching patch of forest against a big open sky. The Miners' style of cozy, indolent slow-core is like a person who never gets out of bed: Lost in far-reaching escape dreams, but utterly trapped. Where all harm ends, so do schedules, responsibility, and ambition. Unburdened, the Early Day Miners' trot is a slow one. They seem neither overjoyed nor panicked by their self-imposed isolation; rather, their music reeks of a panging, misanthropic bereavement. ""Errance"" is the getaway anthem. The song is moody and weighed down but not indolent: Propelled by a polyrhythmic drumbeat, it reveals emo-core and math-rock leanings. Early Day Miners' cushy three-guitar front line-- best employed here-- recalls the towering, interwoven melodies of Juno. ""Townes"" unfurls lazily, with a big, weepy, open sound that brings to mind My Morning Jacket or Songs: Ohia. But by and large, Early Day Miners prefer a spacier, more atmospheric style of slow-core, far removed from the melodrama of bands like Low or Red House Painters. Dan Burton doesn't yowl or weep; rather, he sings as if he may have been told to hush a lot as a child. A bit of exaggeration might help: The band often seem bored by their own efforts. For all its droopiness, All Harm Ends Here doesn't engage sadness but toils obliviously in it like a three-week beard. ""The Union Trade"" takes a jittery odd-time frame and renders it comatose. ""Comfort/Guilt"", despite a peppier, shaker-drawn beat, is underpinned by a fusty synth drone, which jives awkwardly with the band's organic mantra. ""All Harm"", the quasi-title track, fares much batter, featuring a crocheted guitar melody, bright and beautiful for its well-drawn opaqueness. As deftly as Early Day Miners work their craft, the slow-core aesthetic is still pegged in an outmoded, mid-90s frame of mind. All Harm Ends Here is hushed and apocryphal, but at times it sounds almost as half-hearted as it is heavy-hearted. The album also pits a nagging inclination to move forward against ruthlessly maintained simplicity. Unfortunately, Early Day Miners choose the comfort of stasis, where their music quickly grows an uneventful wash: How are we supposed to stay engaged when the band act like their own rope has run out?","Secretly Canadian slowcore group Early Day Miners rise and occasionally shine on their fourth album.

This Right Here Is Buck 65,Buck 65,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4275e6ef959693207e2/1:1/w_160/93d23227.jpg,2005-01-23 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1069-this-right-here-is-buck-65/,V2,"For Buck 65 (aka Rich Terfry, or Stinkin' Rich), career summary is a tall order-- he's made radical course corrections on virtually every one of his albums. This Right Here Is Buck 65 is his first V2 LP, and it's a ragged collection of new songs and drastically reworked tracks salvaged from his back catalog, apparently intended as both an introduction and an artistic synopsis. And though the album probably serves as an accurate snapshot of his headspace at one fixed point in time, the mercurial nature of Buck's talents have fated this to seem as yet another transitional work. Though ostensibly still a hip-hop artist, the Nova Scotia-born Buck 65 continues to play fast and loose with genre orthodoxy, even by the lax standards of his erstwhile Anticon mates. An inveterate scavenger, Buck's continual search for musical origins has again led him down some unlikely cattle-trails to forge improbable links between hip-hop and rustic C&W;, Alan Lomax's folk field recordings, and Woody Guthrie's dust-bowl balladry. Unabashedly courting comparison to Tom Waits, on This Right Here Buck has entirely abandoned the nasally, rapid-fire vocal delivery of his early albums, in favor of a mannered, scratchy gruffness which implies that he's aged roughly 55 years since 1999. This change is most obvious, and arguably most successful, on the remakes of such early tracks as ""Pants on Fire"" or ""B. Sc."" (otherwise known as ""Bachelor of Science"") where his newly weathered rasp imparts an air of world-weary authority to lines like ""I'd rather read the Bible than use its pages to roll joints with."" Filled with shimmering waves of pedal steel and slide guitar, these spare, gritty reenactments will surely please fans of his 2003 urban-folk platter Talkin' Honky Blues, several tracks of which are included again here in unaltered form. Underground hip-hop enthusiasts, however, might be put off by Buck's near-complete disregard for the rippling, sample-laden funk of his youth, particularly on the cleaned-up version of his semi-classic ""The Centaur"". Played here in a stripped-down, acoustic arrangement (with one lyric cryptically changed from ""my cock is so big and the end of it glistens"" to ""my clock is so clean and the hour-hand is missing,"") the anarchic strangeness of the original is all but lost, while this new, dryly sophomoric edition might lead one to draw uncharitable comparisons to Buck's countrymen in the Barenaked Ladies. But on the best tracks here, such as the coolly swaggering opener ""Bandits"" or his rambunctious cover of Guthrie's ""Talking Fishing Blues"", Buck 65 manages to connect his vivid junkyard hip-hop to deeply earthed roots that you'd never guess were there. At the risk of stretching the association beyond the breaking point, perhaps This Right Here can best be compared to such late-70s Tom Waits albums as Blue Valentine or Heartattack and Vine, where one hears an artist coming tantalizingly close to realizing his matured vision, renewing hopes that Buck 65 might someday deliver the hip-hop Swordfishtrombones he seems destined to create.","Buck 65-- the Tom Waits of indie hip-hop-- makes his V2 debut.

Will Anticon be a parenthetical digression or a chapter in rap's overarching narrative? And can a movement sparked by a group of white kids find lasting purchase in the traditionally black medium of hip-hop? Until Anticon's historical context is resolved, when the winners have been crowned and start writing memoirs, these questions will remain open. While we bandy around terms like ""terrorist"" with careless conviction, that designation is history's, not ours, to assign: George Washington, had his revolution failed, might well be remembered as a terrorist; if the Palestinians succeed in ousting the Israelites from their territories, no number of despicable acts will prevent them from going on the books as freedom fighters. While it seems bizarre to conflate the histories of hip-hop and social violence, that's just what Pedestrian does on his debut LP. Volume One: unIndian songs finds him wandering through a sonic and thematic chronicle of hip-hop and the greater historical context from which it emanates, spanning the gap between old school line-swapping and modern Dirty South crunk; between canned, cracking 80s drums and folk music collage; between the cultural criticism of Public Enemy and Anticon's esoteric navel gazing; between Sage Francis and Woody Guthrie and Ice T and Sole. As such, the album is fractured, coded, shadowy, protean, and strange. Pedestrian's sulfurous meditations on death fill the gaps between songs as diverse as ""O Hosanna"", a Run DMC-style party joint flecked with Nas samples and a gospel choir, and the critique of economic violence ""Lifelong Liquidation Sale (1850-1950)"", which is cloven into two parts-- the first, a buzzing hive of sinister electric guitar and stuttering vocals; the second, a placid dronescape that evokes the barren horizons and kaleidoscopic mutations of cLOUDDEAD. And standout track ""O Silent Bed"" is an undie-hop take on Nelly's lilting sing-song and catchy choruses-- Anticon's first certified club banger. The formerly nonexistent borders around Anticon's sensibility are showing signs of ossification. The off-key singing, chaotic clutter, confessional/intellectual lyrics, and willful obscurity that dominate Pedestrian's debut by now have a whiff of the rote. But as Anticon releases become more predictable, they advance in ambition and coherence of vision, and it's easy to fantasize about an album that perfectly distills the Anticon aesthetic. If one were awaiting this theoretical messiah record, one might expectantly look to this long-awaited LP from Anticon's co-founder and spiritual mentor. With its thematic ambition, fragmentary mien, and cameos from Doseone, why?, Sole, Jel, and others, Volume One: unIndian Songs is the consummate Anticon record in terms of its components. But a large part of Anticon's appeal has been its capacity to surprise, and while Pedestrian's record befuddles, proselytizes, and fascinates, it rarely strays from the established palette. While unIndian songs is a beguiling piece of cultural lore, it further cements what Anticon is, not what it could be, and so this mythical, pure articulation of Anticon potential either already exists and will be acknowledged in the final tally (Them's debut? cLOUDDEAD's Ten?), or shimmers tantalizingly over the next ridge.","Anticon's Pedestrian conflates the histories of hip-hop and social violence on this strange, fractured record.

Before the Poison,Marianne Faithfull,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2d5e6ef95969322fe0/1:1/w_160/fd3f325e.jpg,2005-01-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2962-before-the-poison/,Anti-,"Marianne Faithfull has one singing tone: grim. Her Gothic voice conveys gravity perhaps better than any other rock-oriented singer alive, but that ability comes with its own limitations: While Faithfull can make grim sound bitter, biting, resigned, or determined, she can't make it sound triumphant or joyful. But she has staked this darker emotional territory out and made it her own, such that any shade of hope in her voice sounds sadly tenuous. It wasn't always so. On her early recordings, Faithfull's voice sounds ethereal, girlish, and young, which only underscores the heartache of songs like ""As Tears Go By"" and ""With You in Mind"". From that decade she has emerged as a dark angel, and the low texture now in her voice signifies the many hard years in between. It is, in fact, the perfect vessel for the compromised emotions and defeating betrayals of her new album, Before the Poison. If Faithfull's voice has changed dramatically over the years, her creative method has not. From her first hit (Mick Jagger's ""As Tears Go By"") to her Kurt Weill-inspired 20th Century Blues to 2002's celebrity-laden Kissin' Time, Faithfull has done her best work as a collaborator, either covering others' songs or co-writing them with Barry Reynolds or Beck. On Before the Poison, her primary scribe is PJ Harvey, who gives her several complex songs to sing, sometimes even writing beyond her years; Damon Albarn and Jon Brion each contribute one song, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are a perfect choice as a backing band. The mood of these 10 songs is bleak, their subject lost or impossible crazy love. ""The mystery of love belongs to you,"" she confesses on PJ Harvey's ""The Mystery of Love"", as Harvey and Rob Ellis create an elegant tension for Faithfull's crucial question: ""Am I a fool, because of you?"" Harvey also contributes the devastating ""No Child of Mine"", on which Faithfull sings about denying love to a son, as if her rejection will prepare him for a cruel world. But for Harvey, it's an act of heroism, not hatred, and she turns the refrain into a singalong that Faithfull makes majestic: ""Go home, find your own way."" Likewise, Albarn's apocalyptic ballad ""Last Song"" imagines home as a blight: ""We saw the green fields turn into homes, such lovely homes,"" Faithfull sings on the chorus, before explaining ""it's not a love song, it's the last song for you"" in a voice that sounds ragged and weary but self-assured-- almost authoritative. The second half of Before the Poison drops off noticeably, ending with the album's two weakest tracks. The strutting tempo of ""Desperanto"" and its shout-out chorus barely conceal the song's punning conceit, and Brion's gimmicky production and Faithfull's awkward lyrics on ""City of Quartz"" recall her Weill obsession of past albums. Still, Faithfull imbues every song and every word on Before the Poison with the weight of experience, as if age has granted her almost oracular powers. This may not be a perfect album, but it is affecting and haunting.","The legendary singer's new set of grim, gothic songs features collaborations with PJ Harvey, Nick Cave, Jon Brion, and Blur frontman Damon Albarn, among others.

"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning / Digital Ash in a Digital Urn",Bright Eyes,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a15e6ef959693206b5/1:1/w_160/015246e8.jpg,2005-01-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/,Saddle Creek,"Conor Oberst sends shivers down my spine, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. The straight-from-the-diary lyrics, the sudden screams and that hiccuping vibrato-- the qualities that make him seem raw and, to some, risible-- are also striking and awesome. Oberst is a strange hybrid: He's undeniably a pop star, and also undeniably an indie rocker. On the pop side, he has what music journalist Simon Reynolds identified as the power to compel your gaze, and when he gets it, those wet, penetrating eyes stare straight back. I know it makes me uncomfortable; why can't he just look at his feet and fumble with his guitar and murmur his songs from a distance? At the same time, where most of our pop stars spring fully formed from the heads of their handlers, Oberst remains a DI(mostly)Y, friends-over-money, fuck-the-man independent musician. He makes mistakes, indulges his excesses (oh, Lifted, how close you were to a home run), and even shouts his politics, inarticulately but without restraint, which is something that fewer and fewer musicians at his tier would have the guts to do their first time on Craig Kilborn. As you've probably heard from the media blitz, tomorrow Oberst is releasing both a record of road-tested acoustic material and a new project of electronica-flavored pop. The specific triumph of his two new albums lies in how they deliver a new, more seasoned Oberst, retaining what's great in his talent while purging the rough edges. Let's start with the album that's merely ""decent."" Oberst and producer Mike Mogis had talked about making a more rhythmic and electronic album since even before Lifted, and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn finally realizes that project, setting Oberst in front of a rock band, beats and strings. But where a Björk would have tackled this by flitting around the world to find the hottest club DJs and the coldest Inuit choirs, Oberst put the record together with a small crew of his buddies: While Jimmy Tamborello of the Postal Service co-produced the first single, ""Take It Easy (Love Nothing)"" and the Yeah Yeah Yeah's Nick Zinner swings by for a few cameos, the producer that Oberst relies on most heavily is Mogis, who programs under the alias the Digital Audio Engine. Digital Ash places Oberst's voice front and center, stripping away his guitar and impromptu vocalizations and tying him to each song like a good pop star; witness the way he takes ""Devil in the Details"" with the stance of a Bowie. And where the lyrics are self-centered, Oberst still projects himself more broadly and concisely than on Lifted, as he ruminates from up high on everything from the circle of life and death to admitting that he's a dick when he drinks. But if Oberst picked up better posture, he's still learning where to take it. It's hard to pinpoint why Digital Ash is merely ""okay."" The songs are enjoyable, and if Tamborello chips in the most exciting beats, Mogis' are competitive, especially the bamboo-footed-tap-dancer rhythms of ""Arc of Time (Time Code)"" or the moody ""nightmare"" sequence that launches the record. But nothing else captures such a gripping mood. Digital Ash has the claustrophobic feel of a singer locked up with a computer, and it's distractingly chipper, like Rilo Kiley in their own Dntel homages; not every Bright Eyes record has to be an emotional epic, but Digital Ash feels like a practice run. Consider it version 1.0. If Digital Ash sounds like indie kids breaking into pop, its sister disc, I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning, is a red-blooded folk album that's coincidentally built to be hugely, hugely popular. Oberst has been so close to Americana that I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning won't surprise anyone, and even Emmylou Harris' glorious cameos aren't a stamp of approval so much as a professional decision to bring in someone who can nail these harmonies-- a rare and totally warranted exception to the ""friends-only"" policy, because a twentysomething couldn't make pretty sound as weary as Harris on ""Land Locked Blues"". I'm Wide Awake perfectly captures a place and time in Oberst's life. It chronicles his first memories of staying in New York City, and the metropolis rarely gets a folk singer to chronicle its streets this lucidly, at least since the hootenanny days; he frequents its parties and stumbles down its streets like a midwestern transplant instead of a jaded hipster, sings about chemical dependency and the endless pains of love, while capturing as a backdrop the build-up to a foreign war. I'm Wide Awake weaves the personal and the political more fluidly than most singers even care to try, and the consummate tunefulness just strengthens those moments where he pinches a nerve-- the songs that still give me chills every time, like ""At the Bottom of Everything"": ""Into the face of every criminal strapped firmly to a chair/ We must stare, we must stare, we must stare."" This record was made to be loved, to be obsessed over by some but remembered by everybody, to get scratched and worn out through constant rotation in a sorority living room or your first studio apartment or your mom's old radio, to capture Conor Oberst for the first time with more polish than spit, but still getting him deeply under your skin. And he earns it so thoroughly that while ""Poison Oak"" would have been a fine, graceful closer, he propels us instead to the big Bright Eyes finale of ""Road to Joy"", where he justifies the joke of cadging Beethoven's most famous theme, drives the cascading horns and searing guitars, and finally, finally screams his head off. Give yourself to it and you'll understand that when Oberst's staring so piercingly from all those magazine covers, this is what he's looking at.",,8.7,
Gemstones,Adam Green,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe613d197565213b96d/1:1/w_160/8983f17d.jpg,2005-01-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3627-gemstones/,Rough Trade,"Jonathan Richman never goes out of style. Adam Green, whose Moldy Peaches once seemed consigned to I Love the 00s oblivion alongside 2001 novelties like bipartisanship and Zero Wing, seems to have noticed. On Gemstones, Green ditches the string flourishes of 2003's Friends of Mine and dips into Richman's quirky-pop-classicist oeuvre as if it were the anti-folk fountain of youth. Make that a porcelain throne, as Green also scraps Richman's defining naïvete in favor of his own musical essences: toilet humor, pharmaceuticals, and hipster poses. Green's self-consciously dweeby vocals hang his off-kilter lyrics like a doomed curveball. We're supposed to see how clever he is when he invokes celebrities' names or naughty images. Occasionally, he gets his giggles, usually with stream-of-consciousness imagery about ""blank-faced footprints of the zebras in the glen"" or non sequiturs like ""her lips taste just like Sun Chips."" Nearly as often, though, Green is just the average schmuck with cool friends who mistakenly thinks he's the life of the party. Politics aside, Bush-bashing ""Choke on a Cock"" is boring. ""Carolina"" exists for its rhyme with ""vagina."" Crackhouses and cock-biting prostitutes also rear their proverbial heads, titillating would-be indie kids (I just said ""tit""). As far as I know, a clunker describing ""the boy with the sterilized pitchfork"" isn't about us. Prolificacy can be a curse, and 15 roughly interchangeable songs all clocking in between 1 and 3 minutes doesn't help Green's cause. While his arrangements-- relying largely on acoustic guitar and organs -- mostly plunder Richman's simple aesthetic, Green's melodies plumb a deeper well, from Brian Wilson to Kurt Weill. In fact, occasionally Green forgets his loveable iconoclast persona and apes the best-known band to cover Weill's ""Alabama Song"", particularly during the ""L.A. Woman""-tinged breakdown that closes ""Over the Sunrise"". Coming soon: a cover of Jim Morrison's ""Lament for My Cock"". What about Green's health? Sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll are just all right with me, but the man can't let a song go by without mentioning mind-altering substances, from coffee and vodka tonics to Xanax, Zoloft, ""drugstore dreams"" and a man who writes prescriptions on Post-It notes. ""Refill my prescription until next time,"" Green requests on another song, the aforementioned ""Carolina"" (vagina!). Given the right meds myself, I could tell you this theme constitutes a trenchant analysis of our pill-popping society as we hurtle toward a brave new dystopian tomorrow. But that's bullshit. Green comes armed with paradoxical praise from Julian Casablancas: ""He's eccentric and down to earth."" So is Richman, still rock rock rockin' ""Government Center"". But Richman's cult fame lives on for a reason: He means it. With Green, that's never been clear.","The former Moldy Peach is back with another platter of anti-folk bathroom humor.

The Surviving Elements: From the Soul Survivor II Sessions,Pete Rock,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f05e6ef95969320528/1:1/w_160/3e7ed2ff.jpg,2005-01-20 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6903-the-surviving-elements-from-the-soul-survivor-ii-sessions/,BBE,"Pete Rock bothers me. The hip-hop producer's latest joint of 3 a.m. gutter-steamed grooves simultaneously hypnotizes me into a trance and makes me fidget and cringe out of restlessness. Consider it a hip-hop equivalent of sexually frustrated, adolescent foreplay. Take ""Glowing"", a reason for living, number 210. A swaying, miles-deep bassline that demands call-in radio shoutouts to people who never met and neighborhoods that want you to stay out, opens the track, while a timeless soul piano melody softens a beat so crisp that it can break in half. These three elements are noble qualities but when the same six bars are repeated for more than five minutes, it is a chore. It can also leave a listener anticipating events that will never happen. The best minimalism always draws out the most from the slightest gestures; in hip-hop, such instrumentation demands an MC to fill in the gaps. The Surviving Elements is a half-full glass, but there are still some prime breaks for DJs, as well as soundtracks for mating rituals that involve free booze, secondhand smoke, and a library-full of humanity's timeless clichés. Pete Rock is best known for progressing hip-hop's love affair with jazz in his 1992 hit with C.L. Smooth, ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"". Since then, our man has been an underground icon, delivering topnotch productions for ego-centric MCs. His ear catches the latent hypnosis found in funk at its best as his picks of rare basement 45s attests in BBE's Funk Spectrum Vol.3 comp. The Surviving Elements is a collection of B-side instrumentals from last year's album of hip-hop grown from Brooklyn's weed patches, The Soul Survivor II. Opener ""You Remind Me"" is a remix of Al Green's hypnotic classic, ""Let's Stay Together"", where Rock strips everything down to the mama's heartbeat, traces of an orchestra, and the Reverend's choked sighs. It's a near-perfect DJ break to be remixed, beat-juggled and crab-scratched. ""U Are What U Are"" is another Motown number chopped to the knees, where a diva belts out the track's from a Chitlin Circuit soul-45 and is repeated like a string-pulled toy. ""Hop, Skip & Jump"" and ""(Pimp) Strut"" are decent meat-market fodder with a karate-chopped, electric-guitar tone and piecemeal electro-funk synths. Less successful minimalism is the tepid, baby oil-stained, softporn R&B; of ""Midnight and You"" and the shopping mall Muzakbox that duels with a ring-a-ding-ding cosmic-zap in ""Fairground"". Surviving's best moment is ""Hip 2 Hip"", a 22nd century space-funk tune that causes glass-domed cities to arise from those Brooklyn weedpatches. There is bliss for the first two minutes, and then comes the nagging feeling that something should happen. Futurism indeed.","Ace hip-hop producer Pete Rock offers instrumentals that didn't make it on his Soul Survivor II joint. Makes great wallpaper.

Rvng Prsnts Mx3,Tim Sweeney,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69d9d034d5c69bf359f/1:1/w_160/feed8288.gif,2005-01-20 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7801-rvng-prsnts-mx3/,Rvng Intl.,"As more blogs flux pop and more asshole promoters threaten station kids into samey CMJ playlists, college radio continues to lose what little tastemaking power it had in the first place. At this point the scene's an academic discipline, excitement hardly ever reaching outside the station's DJ community. Which is a shame, because I bet there are tons of shows around as fun as Tim Sweeney's ""Beats In Space"" on WNYU 89.1. Almost every Thursday for the past three years, the NYU student-turned-grad has run down the city's most consistently exciting mixed radio sets. Sweeney breaks lots of new wax, but he's insanely generous too, sneaking in the hits when they fit. While a dancekid at heart, Sweeney plays an expert dilettante, reaching deep into the bowels of hip-hop and stalwart indie alike, then ripping a sparse Playhouse twelve on his way out. After an internship at the DFA, Sweeney's reputation has grown substantially. He has mixing credits on that killer third disc of DFA Compilation #2, co-spins with Tim Goldsworthy and James Murphy around New York, and works regularly at APT, arguably the city's last great venue for dance music. Sweeney's shows are archived and downloadable as MP3, but Rvng Prsnts Mx3 is his first official CD release. The mix doesn't pack the surprises of Sweeney's radio sets, and the tracklisting's not nearly as risky, but Sweeney compromises with more delicate beat- and mood-matching. While other dilettante acts like 2 Many DJs and Optimo sell themselves with abrupt genre jumps and cheeky mash-ups, Sweeney is far more selfless, keeping the tracks in the limelight with thoughtful sequences. Manuel Göttsching's E2-E4 begins the first half of Mx3, then is put under the scalpel. Dropping Aphex Twin (""bbydhyonchord""), UNKLE (a remix of Can's ""Vitamin C""), and Radiohead (""Kid A"") after it, Sweeney examines the monumental 1984 recording's influences, nodding at the same time to some of E2-E4's own touchstones: Kraftwerk (""Numbers"") and synth-pop (Tones On Tail's ""Performance""). By now Sweeney's impressed us; midway through, he just wants us to dance-- though not without a brilliant conceit. Mutant disco (Was Not Was' ""Wheel Me Out"", Yoko Ono's ""Walking On Thin Ice"") butts heads with techno legend Carl Craig (""Climax""), whose rubberfunk is chaser for Mu's sewer slime (""Let's Get Sick""), but in the end they're all servile to Sweeney's elaborate song title wordplay: ""Kick in the eye. Wheel me out. Walking in the rain. Walking on thin ice. Let's get sick. Painless. Climax. Free."" The joke nails Sweeney better than I can.","Tim Sweeney-- who expertly mixed the third disc of DFA Compilation #2-- presents an eclectic electro-techno-house blend that features appearances from Kraftwerk, Aphex Twin, Radiohead, and Can, among many others.

Unclassics,Morgan Geist,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c011c0084474cd0c3128/1:1/w_160/c0edce54.jpg,2005-01-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3664-unclassics/,Environ,"The combination of the electronic dance music community's restored appetite for disco with a more general 80s wanderlust has opened the door for a minor Italo disco rediscovery (pleasant side effect: a less hostile attitude towards camp). Not surprisingly, a handful of Italo-themed compilations have been issued in the past 12 months; only a few have been as fun, as revelatory and as representative as Unclassics. Selected, mixed, and bankrolled entirely by Metro Area's Morgan Geist, this mix follows in the tradition of the Environ label head's lovingly deployed Unclassics vinyl releases, which themselves were sort of dust-off and rescue missions for the waylaid orphans of the Italo boom. Cherry-picked and sorta-mixed by Geist himself, the tracks on this continuous set are strung together by all the things that made Italo interesting, namely a sense of goofiness, color, and theatre. To that end, Italo represents the furthest functional extreme from dance music's other current fascination-- microhouse; in the interest of balance and perversity, it makes sense that both should be dominating dance music's discourse at same time. Almost uniformly un-self conscious, Unclassics amounts to a seven-course spread of opulent synths, syrupy melodies, and joyously over-the-top vocal performances. Dance Reaction's ""Disco Train"" is sung by an adenoidal Cameo-soundalike, Victor's ""Go On Do It"" is a campy call-and-response that has slavering raps buzzing up against a female's breathy refrains, and Pluton & Humanoids' ""World Invaders"" contains an opera diva and a vocoded robot anxiously engaging in some sort of epic Wellesian struggle between man and machine (their resolution: duet!) The highlight of the mix is probably Geist's own Hot Edit of Margueritas' shimmering ""Margherita"", which strips it of its made-for-Eurovision vocals and recasts it as an ever zippier ""Popcorn"". Drenched in peppy analog pings, handclaps, and Mexican horns, it's one of the most ridiculously infectious dance tracks in recent memory. Also good is Eurofunk's ""Manshortage"", which deploys a liquid guitar line over a weird, spindly little electro groove. Come to think of it, the only thing that really approaches disco orthodoxy is the twirling strings of the Purple Flash Orchestra's penultimate ""Freedom Now""-- and even that is quickly upended by Gaz Nevada's oddball eight-minute closer, ""Special Agent Man."" It's a weird collection of oblong disco, to be sure, and repeated listens do nothing to diminish its freshness and off-kilter appeal. Credit's due to Geist, not just for being prescient enough to release these tracks at the right time, but for swooping down to rescue them in the first place. Even if it is hard to believe that anybody could ever forget source material like this.","Metro Area's Morgan Geist unearths a collection of lost italo-disco gems.

Outside Closer,Hood,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c11613d197565213bb46/1:1/w_160/e3037b16.jpg,2005-01-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3918-outside-closer/,Domino,"Each Hood album seems to contain at least one single whose first minute sounds like the work of a band that is poised to take over the world, a casually brilliant combination of living-room sound and electronic future-think that trounces everything you've heard in months. This time around it's a track called ""The Lost You"": An airy shard of a sample stutters and slices itself open into a big, lurching beat, the vocal comes muttering modestly in along with it, and by the time the song fleshes itself out into a chorus you're wide-eyed and wondering why every band can't be this carelessly awesome. It's at moments like this that Hood seems like the greatest thing ever: A band making the kind of Serious Innovative Music people like to imagine Radiohead are, only without a hint that they know or care that they're doing it at all. String together a tight, accessible collection of glorious moments like this, and there's hardly a critic on either side of the Atlantic who wouldn't clamor to cast these guys as the new saviors of music. Only there's a catch: That's not really the kind of band this is. It's not that a track like ""The Lost You"" is so different from the rest of their work-- and it's not that there's anything about the songs around it that's sub-par-- it's just that they're really not interested in glory. Recent Hood recordings have less to do with grand pop gestures than with the kind of wandering pastoralia perfected by the Bristol act Movietone: Sometimes they just want to camp out in a room with acoustic guitar and violin and delay pedals and see how a song crawls into shape on its own. Instead of big-budget drama, Hood are reminiscent of the drifting sound-paintings of Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, or Slowdive's final record. Sometimes the song framework takes a back seat to letting dense arrangements of guitar and piano echo around one another. Hood's previous full-length, Cold House, still made gestures toward crisp, cohesive pop, but Outside Closer gets pretty comfortable with the feeling of sprawl. The result is a whole load of cold-sun-on-moors, last-leaves-on-the-tree material. But what's remarkable is that instead of sounding autumnal and frigid, the bulk of this album has a warmth, an emotional weight, and a sense of underlying motion that competes damn well against the occasional fireworks. Some of these pleasures may be subtle or take time to grasp, but the sinking-in is gorgeous and worth the wait. This, in fact, may be as good as Hood have ever been at letting songwriting and sprawl play off of one another-- even though their electronic tweaks back away and the violin takes a larger role. You'd still need the mind of a musicologist to be able to hum some of these wandering melodies and sleepy English mumbles, but that doesn't make them any harder to take in: Even the most lethargic of them-- seven minutes of slow burn on ""Closure"" and ""Any Hopeful Thoughts Arrive""-- gradually gather into something narrative, ballads recast in an impressionist haze. When they aim for shape, there's still the same sense of variation and sprawl around the edges: The terrific ""The Negatives"" weaves samples, strings, and acoustics into a fine-tuned depth that's almost reminiscent of the Church, but it flows along according to a logic that's anything but conventional. What's most striking here depends on what you're in it for. ""Still Rain Fell"" is a big pastoral wash of acoustic guitars and violin melody that casts this band as a set of sophisticated pop songwriters-- this is the kind of relaxed, languorous sound that makes it feel like Hood are conceiving their material late at night in someone's living room. On the other hand, there are ""Winter 72""-- which actually does cross into the dubbed-out full-band headspace of Bark Psychosis-- and ""This is It, Forever"", which reduces the whole band into a momentary sound-art mutter. It's unknown whether or not that title is a hint the band is going to call it a day. This Leeds collective has been floating through various kinds of gorgeousness for just over a decade, more or less improving with every release; they've also already tried breaking up, but without success. It's not really clear whether that mutter of a send-off genuinely marks the end for Hood, but if it does, this record is a bit of a conflicted curtain: A captivatingly strong release that still leaves you wondering if these guys have a world-conquering album somewhere inside them.","England's Hood-- who create dense, echoing arrangements that are reminiscent of the drifting sound-paintings of Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, or late-period Slowdive-- unveil their first LP of new music since 2001's Cold House.

On Blasted, these roomies pull from a sonic palette that wholly evokes their nom de feedback and fashion a 33-minute subterranean landscape of gargling mud baths inhabited by the robotic chirps of rusted aviary grubs. The album displays less joyful humanity/beauty than Animal Collective's Beach-Boy campfire jams and swivels less raucously than early day Black Dice; pinpointing an ambient equator, it loosely resembles Danse Manatee dry humping Beaches & Canyons. Looking outside the band's apartment complex, they're closest to the criminally forgotten Vancouver noise crew Pork Queen-- well, if those Canadians reformed to cover swatches of Throbbing Gristle sauerkraut, extracting porno evil, and presenting preternatural industrial howl as pedestrian video game music. OK, it doesn't really sound that cool; much of Blasted conjures wordy imagery but feels sluggish, lacking the liveliness of Porter/Copeland's main projects. Opener ""Gorilla In The Woods"" bequeaths a drowning sailor's glug to guitar-like creaking, depth-buried entropic repetitions, sprung rhythm, and reverb katydid swirls. If commissioned by Nintendo, imagine digital grubs eating ones-and-zeros roots. The track ends with humanoid bird caws and laughter of its participants, hosing off the anonymity of what came before it. ""Our Single"" is drumpad plus buried vocals, and it equals an auto-asphyxiated Xiu Xiu suffocating inside a house of cellophane. ""West Indian Day Parade"" samples the event that gave it a name, but the low hum of celebratory language and spicy vegetable patties are inter-spliced with a marching band jump cut into a typewriting Burroughs fusion. ""Heavy Angel""'s rumbling percussion has the same soft corners as ""Gorilla in the Woods"" and really, this is all very gentle, somehow submerged and cushioned, a game of padded Pong played by termites. In addition to the titled compositions, there are a handful of untitled maggot granules begging listeners to loop/expand elsewhere: clock chiming and/or unwinding, loose cables spelling ""SOS"", a sand-dollar concertina stuck in the receding ocean jetsam. But let's put it in perspective: Terrestrial Tones is often referred to in reviews as a ""super group"" but although Porter and Copeland are in popular bands, they're also roommates; and as any musician who's lived with other musicians knows, each music house supports about 30,000 bands depending on the night and who's around. So instead of naively reading Blasted as a meeting of indie-rock power brokers, it helps to strip away the distance and funnel the sounds through the framework of two friends getting together in the comfort of their own home and putting some fairly modest abstractions to tape. Still, despite its low-key nature, Blasted is certainly Psych-o-Path's highest profile album to date, though the New York City label's released stronger work including two Space Is No Place Big Apple noise samplers and the shimmering, often painfully beautiful stringed buzz-quake of SF trio Axolotl's eponymous debut. Especially impressive is Mouthus' locked-groove of a self-titled debut, which along with Loam, a mesmerizing follow-up just released by Ecstatic Peace!, establishes the scruffy NYC duo as the most combustible new-school heirs to Dead C's free-range soft-black feedback (as reinvigorated by Lighting Bolt's punky broke-drum tribalism). But whatever, if it takes Terrestrial Tones' middling underwater cricket opera to put Psych-o-Path on the map then Copeland and Porter should rest well knowing they've transcended the skeletal patchiness of this fun but undistinguished offering.","Roomies Dave Porter (aka Animal Collective's Avey Tare) and Eric Copeland (Black Dice) pull from a sonic palette that evokes their nom de feedback.

The Relatives,Jeff Parker,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18b5e6ef959693201e3/1:1/w_160/0ae7079f.jpg,2005-01-19 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6561-the-relatives/,Thrill Jockey,"Although Jeff Parker is the one whose name is written in big letters out on the sidewalk blackboard, the Chicago-based jazz guitarist has always been savvy enough to recognize that-- in the words of De Niro-as-Capone-- nobody wins unless the team wins. As with his work in Tortoise and Isotope 217, Parker's playing as a bandleader is virtually egoless, and on The Relatives he remains steadfast in his willingness to temper and subordinate his instrument's voice in the broader interests of the group at large. Such cooperative benevolence would seem misplaced if Parker hadn't the wherewithal to surround himself with such sympathetic players. Joining him here is his regular rhythm section of drummer Chad Taylor and bassist Chris Lopes (both of whom played on Parker's 2003 debut as headliner, Like-Coping) as well as Sam Barsheshet on Fender Rhodes and Wurlitzer. Here, the quartet move in a loose-limbed, baggy lockstep, with each member given an equal place at the table. If you were to approach this album blindfolded, you might easily assume Taylor or Barsheshet to be the ringmaster, so humbly does Parker deliver his sparklingly clean, unfussy guitar contributions. Significantly less abstract and more song-oriented than many of Parker's past recordings (particularly noise-laden improv experiments such as Out Trios, Vol. 2, his 2003 collaboration with Kevin Drumm and Michael Zerang), on The Relatives he also shares songwriting duties with his bandmates, as well as tackling an ambitious cover of Marvin Gaye's ""When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You"". The album opens with the laidback swank of Taylor's ""Istanbul"", where Parker's breezy acoustic guitar and Barsheshet's organ laze about sunning themselves on the rocks, before the driving, almost Meters-like R&B; fusion of ""Mannerisms"" arrives to shake them from their idyll. The melodic riffling of Lopes' ""Sea Change"" explores some of the same dusky film noir shadows that Tortoise haunted early in their lifespan, while on the title track Barsheshet conjures up a shimmering, humid glaze from the keyboards in a manner that fondly recalls Herbie Hancock's Sextant. Unfortunately, there are occasions when the group skirt dangerously close to the same easy-listening tar pits that have ensnared so many post-rock fusionists. When Lopes introduces a flute on the turtleneck-clad jazz-pop of ""Beanstalk"", you may fear that you've inadvertently stumbled across Anchorman's Ron Burgundy playing an after-hours set down at the supper club. Thankfully, however, such missteps are few, and over the bulk of The Relatives these musicians sound positively ecstatic to be playing with and for each other (if one is to trust the large number of animated hollers they give one another during the course of the album). If you grant them some attention, I expect you'll find their enthusiasm to be infectious.","The Chicago-based jazz guitarist and Tortoise member heads a loose-limbed quartet that also includes Sam Barsheshet, Chris Lopes, and Chad Taylor.

Our Love Will Change the World,Outrageous Cherry,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba1deb335119a49ec956/1:1/w_160/feb596b9.jpg,2005-01-19 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6063-our-love-will-change-the-world/,Rainbow Quartz,"If love was a drug, would the government outlaw it? Can you imagine the FDA approving a drug whose frequent side effects include increased heart rate, inability to think straight, sweating, stammering, and loss of judgment? In the past that might have been difficult, but today it doesn't seem so far-fetched. Outrageous Cherry offer love in packet form on the cover of their latest album, Our Love Will Change the World, an image that together with the album title forms a sort of obtuse pun that's nevertheless fairly clever. The album itself offers packets of a different kind: Two-to-three minute packets of sugary retropop that swings to the beat of the 1960s, finding middle ground between sloppy psych, Spector reverb, Nuggets garage punk, and the syncopated stomp of Motown, which is coincidentally also the Cherry's hometown. It's nice to hear them so effortlessly kick out a concise, instantly appealing batch of melodious songs again-- they experimented with conceptual themes and running the clock a little too long on 2002's The Book of Spectral Projections and indulged in more acidic psych on last year's Supernatural Equinox. Drummer Carey Gustafson has that slapping Funk Brothers beat down pat, and the melodies tumble from lead Cherry Matthew Smith's head with an urgency unheard since 1999's masterful Out There in the Dark. That's still the band's best album, but Our Love is certainly a worthy successor. A return to straight-up, ecstatic pop bliss is immediately evident: Opener ""Pretty Girls Go Insane"" has harmonica wailing over stomping drums as Smith's trumpet blasts a fanfare for the common confused lover. Smith's mild, smooth-toned tenor is a perfect counterpoint to Larry Ray's fuzzy guitar leads, and the layered male/female harmonies on the unexpected breakdown near the end build tension nicely for the finale, when the harmonica wails back into the mix. They run the gamut elsewhere from the pummeling pop explosion of ""Unless"" to the lilting midtempo goo of ""Why Don't We Talk About Something Else"" and from the title track to the melancholy balladeering of ""You're a Reflection of Infinite Chaos"", whose relative lack of reverb only makes the heartbreaking coda all the more crushing. When Gustafson and new bassist Courtney Sheedy join Smith for some Vermont maple harmonies on ""What have You Invented Today?"", the stars align. That sticky song is the greatest kind of escapist pop singalong: It's not the kind of thing that will change the world, but it's a mighty good time.","Detroit-based OC ditch the bloated track lengths and conceptual themes of their recent releases and return to sugary retropop.

Sunday Nights: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a832b1335d7bf1699216/1:1/w_160/1ae91df2.jpg,2005-01-19 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2061-sunday-nights-the-songs-of-junior-kimbrough/,Fat Possum,"David ""Junior"" Kimbrough played his guitar as a form of hypnosis. That statement may sound overly romantic, but it's rooted in practical truth: like dance music, his sexed-up blues worked on the principle that the repitition of a complex rhythm will induce a trancelike state in listeners as their minds surrender to their dancing bodies. Kimbrough's music was an utterly unique form of boogie blues, created and developed at his juke joint in Chulahoma, Miss., where he played for decades before being ""discovered,"" which is like saying the New World was discovered by Columbus and not by the millions of Native Americans already inhabiting the continent. In that venue-- which burned to the ground in 2000, two years after his death-- his music must have elicited a visceral thrill, one lost in the translation to digital media. Even muted on disk, however, his riffs still sound somehow inhuman supernatural, as if he can only channel their infinite wavelength for a few minutes at a time. More than the lyrics or the melodies, it's Kimbrough's riffs that the 15 artists are covering on Fat Possum's tribute Sunday Nights: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough. Each artist has a slightly different approach producing wildly varying results, commensurate with the wide range of styles they represent. Some use the blues rhythms as jumping-off points, placing only secondary emphasis on the words. The chugging guitar pattern on Spiritualized's rendering of ""Sad Days Lonely Nights"" sounds like a perpetual-motion machine: self-propelled and apparently accelerating. That riff quickly becomes the backdrop for a sustained freak-out similar to the band's own ""Cop Shoot Cop"", although, mercifully, not as long. Other artists cover their songs holistically, giving each element equal weight. Thee Shams' ""Release Me"" resets Kimbrough's song in a museum-quality re-creation of 60s swamp pop, and the Black Keys' elegant ""My Mind Is Ramblin'"" simmers mysteriously, with Dan Auerbach using a guitar/amp set-up identical to Kimbrough's. And while the name Pete Yorn usually doesn't inspire consumer confidence, he transforms ""I Feel Good Again"" into a shamelessly catchy pop song. Not every interpretation pulls so much from its source material. The Ponys, Outrageous Cherry, and Whitey Kirst all submit uninspired blues-rock exercises, which weigh down the second half of the album. The vocals by Entrance's Guy Blakeslee on ""Do the Romp"" sound arch and self-conscious, especially compared to Cat Power's soulful performance. And ""Done Got Old"" gets two treatments-- from Jim White and the Heartless Bastards-- both of which sound lightweight, as if neither artist has the age or experience to grasp Kimbrough's mortal resignation. Sunday Nights begins and ends with Iggy and the Stooges, who toured with Kimbrough before his death, performing ""You Better Run"". The first version is a sped-up blues-rock number that perfectly translates Kimbrough's riff to the Stooges' guitar-drenched frenzy; the second is slowed-down and, with Mike Watt's bass bouncing steadily, much more faithful to the original. Both versions feature deranged vocals from Pop. In the song, a woman approaches the singer and asks for a ride home, saying there's a man with a knife who wants to rape her. Halfway home, Pop snarls, ""you might still get raped, baby,"" to which she replies, ""oh, you don't have to rape me, Mr. Pop. 'Cause I love you."" Compared to Kimbrough's original, which underplayed the sexual predation hauntingly, Pop and the Stooges play the song as a lark, making an unsettling singalong out of ""Rape you, baby."" However, Pop's seemingly cavalier take reveals a subtle table-turning: in the end the song implies that the threatened woman has been in control all along, launching a sly, manipulative seduction of the narrator. She is the story's true predator, and he is both her prize and her dupe. While they still raise some very uncomfortable questions, these two versions of ""You Better Run"" prove to be brave, audacious reimaginings that expose the dark heart of the song as well as the intricacies of meaning in all of Kimbrough's work. Of the Sunday Nights contributors, Iggy and the Stooges seem to have the most intuitive grasp of the man and his music. Without stooping to romanticize Kimbrough, they reveal his songs to be more than simply the sum of their riffs, melodies, and lyrics; in their hands-- as in Kimbrough's-- they're dark and mystifying forces.","The late Junior Kimbrough's unique and trancelike boogie blues is given the tribute album treatment by Fat Possum. The collection is book-ended by a pair of tracks by former Kimbrough tourmates Iggy and the Stooges, and it also includes contributions from Cat Power, Spiritualized, the Black Keys, and the Ponys, among others.

Everyday Examples of Humans Facing Straight Into the Blow,The Blow,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a317ea9e61561daa4bd8/1:1/w_160/6aa5d738.jpg,2005-01-18 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/813-everyday-examples-of-humans-facing-straight-into-the-blow/,K,"Erstwhile Microphones vocalist Khaela Maricich-- also known as The Blow-- recently mused in her blog about ""tiny particles of feelings."" It's as if emotions exist as microscopic units, she wrote, and these tiny emo-atoms can combine to form larger meanings. Sure enough, her previously cassette-only debut is chock-full of what she terms ""tiny touches."" But its fragile guitar fumblings and sex-deprived vocals mostly just add up to the primitive demo tape you might expect-- no emotional apotheoses here. Unlike Maricich's recent salvoes into glitchy lap-pop (last year's Poor Aim: Love Songs) and slinky, Gorillaz-flavored beats (2003's Concussive Caress), Everyday Examples of Humans Facing Straight Into the Blow is a stripped-down affair. Maricich manages to make her beginner's acoustic guitar quirky and her anygirl vocals sweet, but those and a pair of corduroys (and a splash of piano) are all you get. And Phil Elvrum and Mirah don't swoop in to save the day, as they did on the Blow's Bonus Album EP. What's left is often interesting-- in typically understated K Records fashion. The multitracked ""oh-oh"" harmonies that back a capella ""Why Don't You"" would probably turn into clipped, dance-y samples like those on Poor Aim's ""The Love That I Crave"" if Maricich recorded them today. As they are, they nicely evoke the ocean she mentions in her lyrics, until tinny, distorted drums (the only percussion on the album) crash in like the surf against a rocky Olympic Coast cliff. The bucolic vision and folky strums of ""Milkmaid"" could wind up on the next Devendra Barnhart-curated compilation. ""That Boy"" brings out the touching innocence in quiet lust by exposing it as something universal, not perverse. Still, many of Maricich's touches dissipate on frequent listens. Opener ""Oh Canada"" drowsily blends melodic elements from Rose Melberg's ""My Heaven, My Sky"", the traditional ""Danny Boy"", and Oasis's ""She's Electric""-- a pleasant mix, but hardly a memorable kickoff. Eagerly adolescent ""Tidalwave"" is the forgettable, tempo-jumping stepsister of ""Why Don't You"". The squeaky, arrhythmic chord changes of ""Surf Song"" give way to vaguely sexual moans, but somehow that fails to shock from an artist who says The Blow is just an easier way to pronounce Get the Hell Out of the Way of the Volcano, the moniker under which she originally released this collection. Taken together, the tiny nano-feelings underlying Maricich's songs don't form a cohesive whole, but they do paint a picture of potential. Nothing here is as catchy or multifaceted as later compositions like ""What Tom Said About Girls"" or ""How Naked Are We Going to Get"", and that's a sign of Maricich's growth, not a knock against her. One cavil, though: The reissue trims the original's flowery, Moz-length song titles into hopelessly mundane clichés. ""My Heart Is Like a Savage, My Heart Would Like a Sausage"" becomes, uh, ""My Heart"". Emotional particles build better when they're not being chopped down.","The latest K release from Microphones vocalist Khaela Maricich.

Fuck Pete Larsen,Wolf Eyes,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa69c0084474cd0c11bd/1:1/w_160/04c002dc.jpg,2005-01-18 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8731-fuck-pete-larsen/,Bad GlueBad Glue,"Pre-Burned Mind Wolf Eyes are bullshit, a soggy biscuit for woody contrarians and rat-faced bastards who lap up our disgust like prissy Meursaults. There's nothing to ""get"": Wolf Eyes aren't laborious (they're merely prolific), and their music's not difficult (it's merely obtuse). This week, an eBay auction of the band's ultra-rare Black Rat Floods three-inch closed at well over $50. I haven't heard BRF, but my guess is standing inside the garage at the fucking Jiffy Lube would give me a pretty good idea. Fifty fucking dollars! Think about how many times you could have your oil changed for fifty dollars. Completist fanaticism aside, I do love Wolf Eyes. For practical reasons really. Often I find myself in a situation where I just want to drown out everything happening around me-- maybe I'm reading, or sleeping, or listening to a new record-- and Wolf Eyes always complete the task. The band's countless limited runs are utterly faceless, but it's a good utterly faceless-- a Johnny Cash utterly faceless. If anything, what makes one Wolf Eyes record better than another-- and again, Burned Mind is in its own league-- is the sheer number of copies floating around (fuck aura). Three cheers for Wabana then, who by re-releasing Fuck Pete Larsen have made this 600-copy vinyl from 2002 the second, or fourth, or 20th best Wolf Eyes record to date. Pete Larson (not ""Larsen"") is the guitarist in husband-wife duo 25 Suaves and the head of Michigan noise label Bulb Records. He released Dread and the band's early sevens and a twelve, but without speculating, it's unclear why Wolf Eyes thought Larson was such an asshole. The album's two 20 minute-plus slabs of fierce analog drones don't demand a backstory though, and in fact, they're kind enough at times to show their hand: Often with Wolf Eyes it's impossible to get through the thick curtain of post-processing to the band's supporting cast of instrumentation. Whether from cassette-to-vinyl-to-CD transfer woes or no mastering, the menacing high-end squeals are pushed back far enough for repeated and lengthy listens. With this sort of distance Wolf Eyes' brand of noise becomes less dangerous and more just plain adorable-- less wild tiger escaping from the zoo, more giant tortoise caring for a stray baby hippo. Both are crazy, but only a picture of the second hangs on my wall.","Wabana gives a wide release to this charmingly titled record, which was originally issued as a 600-count, vinyl-only release in 2002.

Folkloric Feel,Apostle of Hustle,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b313d19756521386c0/1:1/w_160/9604b1dd.jpg,2005-01-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/464-folkloric-feel/,Arts & Crafts,"Apostle of Hustle is a project that Andrew Whiteman founded concomitantly with his more well-known band, Broken Social Scene, and his breathy vocals and radiant guitar style will be immediately recognizable to BSS adherents. By all accounts, Folkloric Feel is the product of Whiteman's crush on Cuban music, which he became drawn to while living for two months in Havana. A sharp, anxious intake of breath here is understandable-- culture jacking can produce laughable and even offensive results, and there's no friend you avoid with more diligence than the one who just returned from Scotland and insists on wearing a kilt to the bars. But the much-ballyhooed Cuban flavor is subtle, a point of departure rather than a destination. Whiteman has shown admirable restraint in burying the borrowed culture deeply within the record's gliding, murky expressivity. It mainly rears its head in certain clattering polyrhythms-- which are a familiar staple of Broken Social Scene anyway-- and in the tactful use of the tres, a Cuban guitar-like instrument that looks like an overgrown mandolin, with three courses of two (or three, in the Puerto Rican variation) strings. The tres's plinking, arpeggio-friendly tone is a staple of the Apostle of Hustle sound, albeit one swathed in a surplus of Broken Social Scene-style distortion and striated atmosphere. Besides the Cuban influence, Whiteman claims allegiance to Manu Chao, John Zorn, and ""the Ancestors and Mentors""-- an apparent reference to old-time musicians and their longer attention span. A long attention span is a must for the title track, a nearly eight-minute long instrumental conversation that evolves so swiftly and complexly the listener feels rather dragged behind it like a muffler sparking on the pavement. It kicks off with a plucky, spiraling tres figure that recombines and ramifies over stark stabs of bass and rattling percussion that grows incrementally more clangorous, more Waitsian. A couple minutes in, a core melody has emerged, which is batted to and fro by call/response style organs and guitars. The evolution is so purposeful that it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when the song changes from baroque folk to a Broken Social Scene seether, and by the time it dilapidates, the poor melody has been battered through an overwhelming multiplicity of inflections and moods. From here the album unfurls like a snapping gray flag: ""Sleepwalking Ballad"" is an up-tempo box step with flashes of grandeur when the melody intermittently shouts its theretofore tacit crescendo. ""Baby, You're in Luck"" finds Whiteman at his most Notwist, trading breathy, lovelorn lines with Amy Milan over a shuffling electro-blues track. ""Gleaning"" sounds of a piece with Clinic's Walking With Thee, with its gently humming organ and whispery, scatted vocals (which are pretty cool, except for one part when they get a little too forceful and begin to sound a little like the guy from Korn). And ""Dark is What I Want / Strutter's Ball"" is full-bore, swaggering space rock, inflected with a jazzy swing, and contains the record's only scorching guitar solo, which is impressively forceful juxtaposed with the more arcane maneuvers it nestles in. By Whiteman's own admission, Apostle of Hustle is a sort of catchall for ideas that are too inscrutable or personal for his other projects. Folkloric Feel impresses itself on your consciousness slowly, by creeping degrees. The songs are mostly too fluid and multivalent to sum up with much fidelity; only the broadest gestures can be encapsulated, and the particulars get lost in the morass. You couldn't chart their changes and components with any more precision than you could a cloud as it moves imperturbably through the sky, and it's from this mutability that the record derives its peculiar appeal, moving in the blink of an eye from genial opacity to vivid bas-relief.","Broken Social Scene's Andrew Whiteman marries his more well known project's style distortion and striated atmosphere with a tactful use of the tres, a Cuban guitar-like instrument.

Snapshot EP,Mission of Burma,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab6ab1335d7bf1699837/1:1/w_160/0a0d8ada.gif,2005-01-18 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8985-snapshot-ep/,Matador,"""Never indulgent,"" drummer Peter Prescott drolly remarks after Mission of Burma finishes a six-minute version of ""Absent Mind"", the third track/indulgence of a radio session captured on Snapshot. The first track and indulgence of this session, ""Tremelo"", seethes for more than eight minutes, building from the titular guitar treatment echoing against itself to the full band working up a frothy sludge where the line between live performance and pre-recorded tape segments blur. The second, ""Youth of America"", tips the scales at 6:40. It's a cover of a Wipers song on which its songwriter Greg Sage claimed: ""many radical recording techniques [were]...used to bring [the song a] frantic realism."" Astute listeners will notice that Sage's radical recording techniques eerily mirror the loop work former Burma member Martin Swope inserted into MoB's songs. Interestingly, Burma excises Sage's trippy loop chicanery from their cover, distilling the propulsive barn-burning fury from the original's grand punk meandering. Instead, Roger Miller's frantic vocals are treated with an apocryphal echo, and his guitar wrangling strikes a similarly anthemic pose. Throughout ""Snapshot"", Miller proves adept at playing the instrument as a musical tool as well as using it as a noise device, treating feedback and distortion with the same respectful disdain that a Guitar World coverboy would show an arpeggio and a hammer-on solo. But I digress. Prescott's ""Absent Mind"" was the only new track essayed during this eight-song session. After its song-part ends-- you know, the verse-chorus stuff-- comes four minutes of vamping that accurately mirrors one's mind going AWOL. Miller makes like a guitar hero yet again, Clint Conley holds down the fort as best he can with his bounding bass work, and Prescott scats across his drumkit while screaming about being master of his domain and nothing ever going his way. Eventually, the stumbling and bumbling ceases, and the small crowd gathered in the studio applaud. It's disingenuous of me to call the ""Absent Mind"" outro ""stumbling and bumbling"" as if it were some extended goof that just happened to coalesce into something useful. If Snapshot serves any purpose, it proves that Mission of Burma have live chops-- even though the group is only two years removed from a 19-year hiatus. Of course, the topic of Burma's inexplicable return to stage and studio is well-worn: post-punk pioneers ignored in their heyday return to active duty two decades later as standard-bearers for a growing group of fans and peers, and yadda yadda yadda, they don't suck. Still, it's not everyday that a rock group performs a concert with an opening act that named themselves after one of the headliner's albums. In light of Burma's unavoidable influence, the pomp and circumstance that heralded their return was warranted, and a long time coming-- think of the ""Inexplicable Tour"" (the handful of reunion shows Burma played in 2002) as a long-awaited victory lap, and the recording of and touring behind their 2004 LP ONoffON as the post-victory spoils. Those two events served, in a sense, as the culmination of all the work Burma put into their music, along with all the music the members created outside of it. Now, after that glorious hoohah comes the part of the story where this highly influential, widely lauded bastion of rock music sets aside the accolades and adulation and goes back to making music simply for the sake of making music. And this is where Snapshot comes in. The second definition of ""snapshot""-- the one that doesn't tie in with a highly-quotable Burma lyric-- is ""an isolated observation"". So consider Snapshot in that light: The songs chosen for this session might not be the most well-known of Burma's career-- there's no ""Revolver"" or ""Academy Fight Song"" (usually found, in live settings, riding the coattails of ""Max Ernst"")-- but they're representative of the group at this point in time. The session's opening three songs exemplify the group's inquisitive, exploratory nature, while ""Red"", ""Dirt"", and especially ""That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate"" are straight-forward sorties that pull no punches. ""Certain Fate"", in particular, sounds remarkably similar to the version recorded on Vs. last century. Conley nonchalantly announces the song title before the group charges straight into the track, with his vocals (""This might be!/ Your only chance!"") hitting the same frenetic notes found on the original cut. It's a remarkable performance. In concert, it's difficult to miss the tape looper Bob Weston's contributions, even if he's stationed out of sight behind the mixing board. However, on the new record, his presence is seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the songs. He loops the delirious ping-ponging dada chant at the end of ""Max Ernst"", he throws back the ""oooh wee oooh""'s of ""Red"" at varying speeds during the bombastic climax, and he plays Roger Miller against himself near the end of ""Tremelo"". Weston's best works, however, can be found in ""Mica"", the group's best performance from this session. Fans will undoubtedly remember the beginning of this song: the five-note guitar figure, a tweaked version of the Close Encounters motif, played slowly at first, then played a little faster, then faster, then faster, until the drums hop on board and the song zips off. Weston adds a distorted brassy wheezing noise that sounds like a slowed-down train whistle. Combined with Miller's increasingly faster playing, this loop ably complements the track's locomotive introduction. As on the recorded version, Conley's vocals are spit back at him backwards as the band stabs their way through the song. At first, this second voice is barely discernible; the second time through, however, these reversed voices almost drown out Conley's actual voice, dressing the would-be patient detailed in these lyrics in damning clothes. When the musical chaos gives way to Prescott's tribal beating towards the end, this second voice continues jabbering, making the final question posed by the lyrics-- ""What could I say to that?""-- that much more poignant. And when the song finally comes to a shuddering halt, Weston brings back that distorted whistle one last time, signaling the end of this wild ride. In the hands of lesser talents, these tricks and trials would come off as overindulgent; in Burma's hands, they're masterful additions. Peter Prescott was taking the piss with his little aside, but he was spot on. Mission of Burma: never indulgent. And rarely better.","Post-punk legends follow last year's triumphant OnOffOn with a new eight-song EP recorded at Boston's Q Division Studios and originally broadcast on WFNX. Though it's only available via iTunes, it's strong enough to see wider commercial release. Snapshot captures these elder statesmen in what has always been their rawest and most primal state: live.

A pie chart showed that California rappers only constituted around 3% of those same playlists-- a far cry from the early 90s, when Dr. Dre, 2pac, and Snoop Dogg all but owned the rap landscape. Since then, 2pac's been gunned down, Snoop and Ice Cube have fallen off hard, and DJ Quik and the Bay Area scene have had little success breaking through to the mainstream. Dre's kept his name in circulation by producing Eminem and 50 Cent-- but even he hasn't released material under his own name since 1999, constantly delaying the release of his supposed masterpiece, Detox. So The Game, Dre's newest protégé, has a lot riding on him. The Compton MC made a name for himself on the mixtape scene that made 50 Cent a star; it made perfect sense for him to become the first West Coast representative of G-Unit. And having spent the past few months embroiled in pointless beefs with also-rans like Joe Budden and Yukmouth-- and getting hammered from all sides-- Game needs more than ever to deliver a debut to back up his talk. Now he has: The Documentary is the best West Coast street-rap album since DJ Quik's 2002 LP Under tha Influence. All of the G-Unit solo albums thus far have been aesthetically unified, a rarity in hip-hop; the tracks on The Documentary actually sound like they belong on the same album. Dre produces five of the album's 17 songs, applying his recent stripped-down cinematic style, and many of the record's other producers follow his lead. Superstar beatmakers like Timbaland and Kanye West hold back on their signature tics, fitting their usual approaches into the album's fabric. The end result is a rich, triumphant sonic tapestry; you can hear every dollar that went into it. The Game is not a particularly singular rapper. His hoarse, guttural voice doesn't possess any of the relaxed menace of classic West Coast rappers; he sounds more like Tha Dogg Pound member Daz Dillinger than Eazy or Snoop or The D.O.C. He has an appealing confidence and an unforced lyrical toughness, though: ""I spit for the niggas doing 25 on they fifth year, ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier/ For the white boys in the Abercrombie & Fitch, yeeah/ And every nigga who helped me to get here,"" he rhymes on the dramatic and brutally hard Just Blaze banger ""Church for Thugs"". Unfortunately, he also frequently sounds awkward on hooks, seemingly hoping that simply repeating the same phrases a few times will suffice. In fact, many of the best tracks are the ones on which 50 steps in to deliver the hook, like the bananas single ""How We Do"", where 50 pushes the music-box Dre beat perfectly. Throughout the album, Game seems obsessed with his place in rap history, constantly name-checking Dre and Eazy-E; on ""Dreams"", he spits, ""The dream of Erik Wright, that's what I'm giving you/ Who walked through the White House without a business suit/ Compton hat, jheri curl dripping on Ronald Reagan's shoes."" But the impeccable beats and The Game's authoritative gruffness carry him through the album; he never sounds like anything less than a star on the rise. Only at the album's end, however, does he reveal his greatest gift: a powerful, heartfelt vulnerability. On ""Like Father, Like Son"", the album's final track, he tells of the birth of his son. Over Needlez' melodramatic, string-laden track, he raps, ""Nose, ears, eyes, chin just like your daddy/ I'll die before you grow up and be just like your daddy."" Same rhyme or not, it lends a stark humanity to Game's sometimes empty braggadocio.","Dr. Dre's latest prot?g? boasts not only an impressive set of producers (Dre, Kanye, Timbaland, Just Blaze, Scott Storch, Hi-Tek) and guests (Eminem, 50 Cent, Busta Rhymes) for this highly anticipated throwback to early 90s West Coast gangsta rap, but also a hoarse, guttural vocal style that commands more presence than precedessor 50 Cent.

Wilderness,Archer Prewitt,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2065e6ef9596932030a/1:1/w_160/f15c23ad.jpg,2005-01-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6470-wilderness/,Thrill Jockey,"I'm a sucker for bridges and codas. I love their unpredictability, how they insouciantly break with songs' often grid-like verse-chorus-verse panelling. Being struck by one is like venturing beneath 4th street for the first time and finding yourself suddenly deep in quaint, snarled Lower Manhattan, or like discovering a hidden package behind the tree on Christmas morning when you'd given up on getting that Red Rider BB gun. The unexpected detours on Archer Prewitt's new album Wilderness are even better: Rather than simply disregarding convention, Prewitt ingratiates his off-the-beaten-path escapades-- two-minute bridges, codas, and codas of codas-- into coherent form, and the resulting songs are fluid and virtuosic. This prodigiousness may come as a surprise to those familiar with Prewitt's work. While the Sea and Cake contributor and Chicago denizen has released four accomplished solo albums since 1997, he's never before experimented as confidently with spiraling song structures or adventurous instrumental adornment, and he's seldom approached such heights. The consistency of Wilderness' eleven songs is almost overwhelming. Pick a track: Buried amid a complex topography of busy yet buoyant orchestration and sundry subtleties you're sure to find a sterling hook that would probably sound great even if it were handled fecklessly. Dusting off the ashes of 2002's coarser Three, opener ""Way of the Sun"" steals in on a babbling bell melody. Unassumingly, Prewitt joins the fray, strumming and singing as if nothing much has changed-- it's just another humble singer-songwriter album. Out of nowhere comes a titanic, vaguely Dylan-esque chorus-- as memorable and articulate as anything Prewitt has ever done-- and it all comes into focus. Then, a lithe bridge flows in almost like an afterthought-- the first of the album's many dazzling, unforeseen twists. ""Leaders"" starts routinely and grows more unconventional with every turn: The song's exceptional chorus is buffered by a stately harpsichord lick. Then the track slows as Prewitt reasserts the chorus at two-thirds speed before tacking on a tiptoeing Dark Side of the Moon coda. ""O, KY"" turns the trick even better, processing a bouncy, shuffled intro before deciding it would rather be plaintive and bittersweet. Stiffening up and straightening out, the track performs a wild about-face, running through a couple of nervy verses before regrouping for a dramatic finale that puts most prolix rock bands' best riffage and structural histrionics to shame. ""Think Again"" is Wilderness' darkest song; it also implicates Prewitt's role in the Sea and Cake-- though the song takes just as much of its dusky, open-air vibe from Thrill Jockey brethren Tortoise's TNT. Part of Wilderness' charm is its trembling near-composure: Prewitt doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve. Rather, he lets his emotions seep out in brief moments of vulnerability before thinking better of it and curling back up. On ""Cheap Rhyme"", his vocal snarling is almost flagrant amid so much modesty. True to form, the song funnels out into a regal, horn-driven bridge, but not before Prewitt's weakness becomes apparent. He can't belt, but Wilderness is almost better for it: Although Prewitt doesn't possess James Mercer's earth-shattering tenor or A.C. Newman's hand at pop hooks, those limitations have only led him down a more carefully considered-- and more interesting-- route. His struggle to circumvent has earned him one of the most idiosyncratic and captivating voices in songwriting, and Wilderness is his most focused solo effort yet.","The Sea and Cake leader confidently experiments with spiraling song structures and adventurous instrumental adornments.

Out of Nothing,Embrace,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc5dc0084474cd0c2a8d/1:1/w_160/867c7923.jpg,2005-01-17 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2769-out-of-nothing/,Independiente,"The Brits are supposed to be all about composure and repression. Funny then, how a litany of bathetic British bands-- Travis, Coldplay, Keane, Snow Patrol-- are all teary-eyed bluster and grandiloquent piano ballads that claw at the cloud cover till it's cheesecloth. Is England so gray and soggy that she needs these maudlin, unabashedly contrived arena-packers for a morale boost? I suppose if it's cloudy out, you lack a lady, the dog's got intestinal parasites, and you're wondering how it got to be time for EastEnders and you're still in sweats, the music has a certain charm. But most of us in the States want to spend an introspective hour with Parachutes. Nine times out of 10, we go for the quick fix. Embrace have been at it for awhile and, like Bacardi and cola, you can always count on them to get the job done. But never have they turned in an effort as pretty or economical as Out of Nothing. Like a concert hall built atop a subway line, the album quakes with a faint but omnipresent tremor of sadness, tempering Embrace's heavenward stomp with a melancholic gegenschein. The album opens on high with a song appropriately titled ""Ashes"". God knows what Embrace have endured: platinum-selling albums and chart-killing singles can take a toll. ""Ashes"", however, captures the feel of post-personal disaster perspective-shift, tidily kneading lyrics like: ""Now watch me rise up and leave all the ashes you made out of me,"" into a dutifully anthemic chorus. ""Gravity"", the album's lead UK single, is the standout ballad, a kindly, ""Imagine""-style piano pulser that manages to outstrip the sum of its parts.""Someday"" is the winsome, face-the-day rocker, replete with a chorus that wrenches as much as it punches and a tumid gospel-tinged ebb. Only on ""Wish 'Em All Away"" and ""A Glorious Day"" do the band approach Oasis' pomp, and that's not even as bad as it sounds. On the former-- a lighters-out strum-- a chorus gravitating around the word ""wish"" and some superfluous harmonica is all. ""A Glorious Day"", meanwhile, is an unneeded rehash of ""Gravity"", the better ballad. Other bad news? Don't expect any choruses the size of Travis' ""Sing"" or any of Coldplay's chart-topping singles; Embrace prefer understatement and consistency. But the result is less wish-wash, more dependable songwriting. For our non-X-dropping sort of sad sack, Out of Nothing provides a neat and reliable uplift, and sometimes that means the world.","Oh, those Brits and their bathetic balladry. SWOOON.

Cypher Documents I,Bardo Pond,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21713d19756521387b3/1:1/w_160/7237731c.gif,2005-01-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/562-cypher-documents-i/,Three Lobed,"Slapstick mystic Tom Robbins wrote that human bodies are actually vehicles for water to travel on land. There could be a grain of truth there, as understood from listening to hours of Bardo Pond in one sitting. The Philadelphians cannot kick their habit of playing blues that floats among the streets after the Earth sunk underneath the sea. The Brothers Gibbons don't strum their guitars as much as shaking off distortion to let their notes dry; Ed Farnsworth's trapkit desperately flails a waterfall and gasps for air; Clint Takeda's two-chord basslines ground the chaos on earth in a codeine slumber; and Isobel Sollenberger gives CPR breaths with her prayers in tongue. Cypher Documents I amasses six MP3s that Bardo Pond released monthly on its Hummingbird Mountain website for free between 1999 and 2000. Neophytes now have the opportunity to pay $13.95 for the goods. These tracks are mainly jams that gaze at their fingernails, but what the music beholds can barely be described by the King's English. There are almost no peaks or resolutions save for when the thinly-oiled machines collapse from entropy. In a way, Cypher marks a transition between Set and Setting and Dilate, although the band stills recycles its cauldron-boiled thrash-blues formula. Little progression here, but that doesn't matter. Opener ""Living Testament"" (released on the 2002 comp, Get Your Pots Out) is vintage Bardo Pond. Takeda and the Gibbons cough up soot while delivering their ohms to the heavens as Sollenberger murmurs and agonizes over migraines. One curious tune is ""Slag""-- a near-marvel of fumigation-rock. The guitars mechanically blow steam, grind out a downer blues, blow steam, grind, and so on. It is a great idea for a hit-and-run minute, but grows rather cumbersome over four. The best from the mire is ""Black Turban"", featuring a guitar solo that stumbles around in circles to see God's thousand faces, while another guitar shimmers a drone that tell the onlookers to not worry as the good Lord is working in mysterious ways. One of the Gibbons then spends the final three minutes tapping his strings as if trying to slap the divine one awake. Cypher's finest moments are when the band simply breathes. ""Nomad"" is a pleasant stroll across a moonless plain with specks of yellow phospherent lights on the horizon. Sollenberger's violin veers by like a distant train, while Takeda's low bass tones are akin to covering your ears to hear your bloodstream. ""Quiet Tristin"" is just as haunting where the guitars are left to dangle on a lone tree surrounded by draught-cracked pools. The finale, ""From the Sky"" is a 31-minute psych-blues sketch projected on a two-story wall that can be a public safety hazard when played on a freeway drive. The auto-pilot groove floats in midair, while the guitars bite the surface, draw blood and skitter away-- all capable of knocking you into a daze. It's a peculiar sound.","Philly-based space-rockers inaugurate their new reissue series of odd and ends. File under the DEA's Schedule I of controlled substances.

Valende,Jennifer Gentle,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4aea9e61561daa71e4/1:1/w_160/0d4c77e6.jpg,2005-01-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4354-valende/,Sub Pop,"It requires a peculiar extreme of self-assurance for two guys to name their band Jennifer Gentle, thereby ensuring themselves a continuous career of potential listeners mistaking them for a solo female act. However, you don't have to listen long to the crazed psych-pop created by the Italian duo of Marco Fasolo and Alessio Gastaldello to realize that these fellows possess a ridiculous abundance of just such confidence. Valende is Jennifer Gentle's domestic debut, following two self-released albums back home, and it reveals a manic, uncommon glint in their inventive fires, the unmistakable fervid gleam which accompanies artists who know exactly what they're doing, even if the rest of us don't. Syd Barrett fans should recognize the name Jennifer Gentle from a lyric in Pink Floyd's ""Lucifer Sam"", and if you think that's the end of the duo's Barrett allusions I'm afraid you're a woefully bad guesser. Thankfully, though, Valende proves Piper at the Gates of Dawn-era Floyd to be just one influence among many, and the rapturous melting pot of their sound also incorporates Joe Meek-inspired sci-fi daffiness, the adventurous instrumental textures of Nino Rota's film music, as well as tender-hearted loner-folk. And it's all combined with enough sheer homespun oddity that Jennifer Gentle's unique sound has even managed to awe the enlightened likes of the Sun City Girls and Acid Mothers Temple (whose Kawabata Makato has toured and cut a live radio session with the duo.) The album opens with the relatively restrained ditty ""Universal Daughter"", a brief number with a melodic structure similar to that of Barrett's ""Terrapin"", sung by Marco in a heightened toothache pitch that suggests he may have just sucked all the helium out of the Goodyear blimp. Though actually more subtle and reined-in than much of the material from earlier Jennifer Gentle albums like 2002's Funny Creatures Lane, the initial rush of this track hits like a quick puff of laughing gas, and immediately sets the album's alien tone. Speaking of helium, the boys issue still more on the following ""I Do Dream You"", releasing it slowly from a toy balloon (every toddler's favorite instrument) as a solo in the middle of the frantic number, which otherwise sounds like a prime 13th Floor Elevator single played at 78 rpm, complete with hairpin organ licks. After this breathless introduction clears away that first wave of big-game jitters, Jennifer Gentle settle down enough to allow Valende out for some fresh air, using acoustic guitar, glockenspiel, and a phased-out violin to conjure sadly sweet pastoral visions on ""Circle of Sorrow"", Field recordings of chirping birdies are brought in on the lovely folk sprawl of ""The Garden"", which is split into two sections. Although on acoustic guitar Marco lacks the technical prowess of a Ben Chasny or Matt (MV) Valentine, his enthusiasm and melodic economy help make these genteel excursions memorable. Less successful is the extended free-form track ""Hessesopoa"", a cacophonous improvisation that oddly enough feels like the most retro cut on the album, recalling the instrumental freak-outs of the Red Crayola's Parable of Arable Land in a manner that bears little new fruit. Clocking in at more than seven minutes, ""Hessesopoa"" does little to reward repeat listens, and its appearance mid-album unfortunately slows Valende's momentum considerably. The two quickly recover from that misstep, however, and the album closes with the insane cartoonish glee of ""Nothing Makes Sense"", where the boys' sped-up voices eventually reach true Alvin and the Chipmunks velocity. And although it's the type of conclusion that might just prompt your annoyed spouse to come into the room to ask, ""what the hell IS that?"" something tells me that the men of Jennifer Gentle would proudly consider such a response to be a resounding success.","The bandname's misleading: This new Sub Pop signing isn't a delicate female singer/songwriter; it's two Italian dudes heavy into Pink Floyd.

The Holy Bible,Manic Street Preachers,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38f69fc7814a47cd68c/1:1/w_160/ffdf6b53.jpg,2005-01-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5074-the-holy-bible/,Epic,"There comes a certain moment in the life of a music fan when the realization hits that you've crossed the line from being merely interested in a band to being a collector, a bit obsessed maybe-- scouring magazines for a curiosity fix, digging in dollar bins, scanning instrument credits in used shops, making long lists of great songs for driving past lakes in the moonlight, buying things by bands that look like they might sound kind of like the Smiths, and...well, half a decade after you cross that line, you look around your home and the teetering piles of discs you've barely had time to listen to, clear the liner notes from the second Nuggets boxed set off your coffee table and think to yourself, ""is this what I've become?"" For those of us most woefully afflicted, the answer of course is ""yes."" The music-- which I like to think remains more important than the objects-- makes itself part of your fiber through repeated listening, and indeed informs your personal composition, perhaps your philosophies and your picture of locales you've never been to, like Jamaica, Wales, or Brazil. One of the dozen or so albums that pushed me to that point was The Holy Bible by Manic Street Preachers. Being an American, the record was not easy for me to find, and I bought it at the first record convention I ever attended, in a ballroom at the Boston Radisson, for $9.98 plus tax. It was worth the search, and it quickly became a favorite. Had I been British, the story would have been different, of course. The record hit No. 6 on the album chart and spawned three top 40 singles, while the band briefly occupied a side ring in the UK pop circus as lyricist Richey James-- notorious previously for carving ""4 Real"" into his arm on Steve Lamacq's BBC television show-- dropped completely off the face of the earth as the band neared completion of their follow-up, Everything Must Go. He still hasn't been found. In the intervening years, the band, as a trio, have become bona fide superstars in the UK, scoring back-to-back No. 1 albums and constantly turning up in those annoying UK rock mag features where about 80 otherwise respectable musicians are goaded to talk about whether they smoke after sex or how many times they've mooned the opposing side's fans at a football match, but when they made the album they were still hungry, pissed off, and discovering their powers. Their previous album, Gold Against the Soul, was a labored, sophomore-slumping hard rock turd that had them looking washed up early, and there was really no preparation for the intensity, perversion, and genuine darkness of The Holy Bible. In a way, the story of Edwards' spiral into some unknown oblivion is tied to the experience of The Holy Bible, which in retrospect has become a sort of horror-show eulogy for a man who couldn't live with the world around him. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Tom Lord-Alge prepared a slightly different U.S. mix of the album that never saw release, and when years later mentions of the album in conjunction with other things I liked popped up in a couple of magazines, I decided I would procure it any way possible (like I said, it pushed me over the line), unaware of the context of its creation. Flash to 2004 and to celebrate the album's 10-year anniversary, Epic has given it the royal, double-disc/single-DVD reissue treatment, remastering the UK mix and adding live tracks (different live tracks from the ones on the Japanese version, if you're wondering) and finally shedding daylight on the abandoned U.S. mix (the band's favorite mix, actually), which is included on disc two along with a couple of unremarkable demos and three radio session recordings. It's best to approach the record from two angles: the political and the personal. Bassist Nicky Wire's lyrics cover the band's socialist propagandizing and soapbox grandstanding bases but it's Richey's songs of intimate torment that elevate the album beyond unbearable self-righteousness. The band's far-left politics range from platitudinous (""Prejudice burns so much brighter when it's all we have to burn"") to boneheaded (""Fuck the Brady Bill""? Come live in an American city for a few months, guys.), but anorexia diary ""4st 7lb"" brims with genuine anguish drawn from Richey's own personal struggle with the disease. ""I want to walk in the snow and not leave a footprint"" sings James Dean Bradfield on his behalf, pulling you into the head of someone who knows he has a problem, and not only can't he fix it, he grows to lord it over others, twisting it into a sort of superiority complex. It's harrowing stuff. The remastering on the UK version does its job well, adding some extra punch, bulking up the low end, and rightfully clearing up Bradfield's superlative vocals a bit, but it's easy to see why the band was so taken with the U.S. mix. Aside from the occasional over-addition of reverb (""4st 7lb"" especially) and a bit at the end of ""Yes"" where the guitar just doesn't sound right at all, it really beefs up the rhythm section and injects a little needed space into the band's tightly coiled arrangements. And Sean Moore, the unsung Manic, finally gets his due on ""Ifwhiteamericatoldthetruthforonedayitsworldwouldfallapart"" when Lord-Alge rams his frenetic, excellent drumming straight up your nose. Wiry, explosive rockers like ""Faster"" and ""Mausoleum"" naturally benefit from the new emphasis on the band's inventive riffs and rhythms. Back when I found this album at the record convention stall, I figured it would be lost to American ears for good, and quite frankly, Epic's decision to finally put it out over here in this deluxe edition is an odd one. Though it's had plenty of time to marinate in critical acclaim, the Manics are no more popular here now than they ever were-- perhaps less so than five or six years ago, actually-- and most Americans who were interested got their hands on imports long ago, rendering this purchase unnecessary to all but a select few. Still, a late arrival is better than none at all, and this reissue proves that the band's undeniable apex (only Everything Must Go even comes close) still retains the visceral power that made it so great to begin with.","This 10-year anniversary edition of these Brits' career peak adds the long-lost U.S. mix of the album, as well as live tracks, demos, a DVD, and more.

Highly Bred and Sweetly Tempered,Climax Golden Twins,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a726c0084474cd0c0b17/1:1/w_160/7f6f5d19.jpg,2005-01-16 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1790-highly-bred-and-sweetly-tempered/,North East Indie,"Stay on the black keys and you can't go wrong. That's the first lesson curious hands learn at the piano. Your fingers can wander where they please on the ebony and the pentatonic scales will agree it's the place to go. And forget about tonal gravity, because the notes won't lead you to any resolution-- you can play these weightless notes for hours. Listening to hours of it, though, is another story and it gets old fast, which I guess is why the Climax Golden Twins cut off their own stick-to-the-black-keys moment barely two minutes into their latest album. ""Upright"" is the prettily pentatonic track in question, and though it's the most basic kind of amateur, pedal-down piano noodling, it's still strangely poignant. Set against slowly arcing scrapey-droney bits (stickheads rubbing on cymbals and the like), it takes on a great deal more power, and the minimal texture-songs that surround it deny it a chance to linger for too long. Highly Bred and Sweetly Tempered, the band's fifth album, is baked from simple, sparingly implemented ingredients sometimes spiked with challenging timbres and, on occasion, indebted to the ramshackle sound of ancient acoustic blues. That scraped, crackly, hazy feel is appropriate for a band whose website sells cassettes recorded from dusty 78s on their hand-cranked 1924 Victrola and also made a name for themselves in sound installations and soundtracks. Those same 78s-- field recordings, audio letters to loved ones and heirs, dramatic readings and the like-- pop up on several of these songs, speaking out of the ether like wandering souls. The Climax Golden Twins practice a great deal of secrecy when it comes to their identities, but this stance has a logic related to their music, as its active ambient soundscapes surrender any focus on the musicians' personalities in favor of mood and nuanced sound. Guitars don't so much enter as happen, while the drumming is all loose brushwork, breathing cymbal and understated grace. ""I Had a Cousin, very old, he believed every word in the Bible. Well, I never did,"" says the lady on the 78 as ""Billy McGee McGaw"" slides in gracefully from the side, stuffed full of airy oscillations, papery snare, and guitar. ""For Adeline (Guitar Trio)"" is the late highlight, opening with the nearly impenetrable hiss and scratch that coats a once-fresh recording of a man singing over wispy, dead piano but pupating into a stark, organic guitar conversation that counts the fret noise as much a part of the music as the notes themselves. If there's a misstep here, it's ""Solid Gold Microphone"", which sticks out of the middle of the record like a sore thumb, both as the only vocal track and as the only thing that's terrible-- the minimal guitar and phlegmy, tentative vocals belonged on the cutting room floor instead of the middle of the record. But most of the album succeeds in spinning a web of flaxen beauty that swallows your thoughts in its texture and caresses even in its harshest moments. It's not a revelation, but it is a very pleasing album.","Climax Golden Twins' fifth album mixes field recordings with the ramshackle sound of ancient acoustic blues.

Gnayse,Bola,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42a9d034d5c69bf2fd1/1:1/w_160/c5d68e99.jpg,2005-01-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1072-gnayse/,Skam,"After spending a good chunk of time with Bola to prepare for this review, I began to wonder if Darrell Fitton's considerable rep in IDM circles might have a wee bit to do with his ultra low profile and reclusive nature. Back in 1995 he was on the second of Warp's Artificial Intelligence compilations and debuted with an EP on Skam in 1996, but he kept people waiting until 1998 for his debut album Soup. A trickle of singles, collaborations, and compilation tracks kept people interested but unfulfilled, during which time Bola's stature continued to grow. Both Soup and its follow-up, Fyuti, are good albums, but sometimes it seems as though Fitton's work nestles too easily into the classic Warp/Rephlex/Skam template. While you can't fault the construction of his tracks, one wishes his voice were just a bit more distinctive, that he had an easily identifiable signature to make him stand out in this crowded field. Gnayse doesn't quite remedy this situation, but it does present a departure, as Fitton moves Bola toward the fog-shrouded hills of pastoral electronica. It's strange how this sort of thing works, really, that purely electronic sound born and developed inside rubber-lined metal wires can evoke the leafy English countryside. But this chill seems far removed from the city center, conjuring instead with its long, patient melody lines a druggy stroll through a tangled garden. The change in sound comes mostly from abandoning Bola's tightly sequenced synths-- a nod to classic techno-- and replacing them with slowly unwinding single notes that hang in the air and dissipate slowly like smoke. The short and lovely ""Heirairerr"" is like a Harold Budd composition heavy on the Eno treatments, with echoing notes that seem too fragile to sit next to the whining drone that snakes through. Equally evocative is ""Sirasancerre"", which fades in slowly from silence, beginning with a faint murmur of what could be insects at Lizard Point, then introduces melodramatic synthetic strings and, eventually, a coughing beat. Though the opening of ""Papnwea"" suggests groaning machinery being pushed randomly by heavy wind, Fitton works his magic with synthetic sources, never peppering tracks with samples. This gives Gnayse a certain purity that helps it maintain its very specific mood. ""Papnwea"" illustrates another point when overbearing percussion bursts in just past the two-minute mark. As happens occasionally with Boards of Canada, you sometimes wonder how Bola might sound if Fitton moved in an even more ambient direction. It's the beats, definitely, that keep Bola staked near prototypical IDM, what is by now an overly familiar sound. He does this style well-- better than most, probably-- but the pleasures to be had inside these narrow confines are not infinite.","More pastoral electronica on Skam Records from this IDM mainstay.

Though he suffers from the sort of debilitating tendonitis and carpel tunnel inflammations that would send most of us permanently to the sofa, Weeks has persevered to complete the most productive and satisfying stretch of his career to date. Following up his 2003 solo EP Slightly West and last year's extraordinary debut with his acid-folk group Espers, Blood Is Trouble finds Weeks using his voice and those damaged hands to create a quietly powerful suite of songs which resolutely delve the darkest shadows of his talents. Although his extensive use of acoustic instrumentation will probably cause Blood Is Trouble to get lumped into the ongoing outsider folk movement, Weeks' songcraft here owes relatively little to folk tradition-- especially in comparison to his work in Espers. You'll certainly find nothing to resemble the ballads, jigs, and reels of Fairport Convention or the Incredible String Band. Blood Is Trouble instead belongs alongside the rain-soaked progressive art-rock of Nico, Leonard Cohen, and the more downcast recordings from the Canterbury scene, particularly albums like Robert Wyatt's Rock Bottom. As with Weeks' previous solo efforts, the arrangements on Blood Is Trouble are heavy on harmonium and the hums of ancient keyboards. The weight of these earthy, ever-present drones-- frequently augmented here by the dramatic sweep of Margie Weink's cello and contra bass-- supply these songs with a seemingly bottomless gravity, which can often pull Weeks' vocals and guitar under their black waves. Melodically bolder than his past solo work, the album is punctuated with the occasional prog-rock indulgence, such as on the Ghost-like cymbal-crashing interjection of ""Don't You Open Up (Your Eyes)"" or the lush, near-chamber instrumental passages of ""Nearer Thine Eyes"". As the album's title implies (unsurprisingly, given Weeks' health maladies), the lyrics are often centered around the difficulties caused by our possession of physical bodies. Whispers of danger and injury-- both actual and spiritual-- arise repeatedly in these songs, as on the foreboding ""Violence Lake"" where Weeks warns someone to ""Hide your body away from mine/ Because I know what I want to do to it."" And on ""These Hands"", Weeks appears to be directly formulating a stubborn answer to his own health problems, repeatedly singing ""These are not my hands before me"" until he sounds able to believe it enough to allow his guitar to weave nimble threads through the thick gauze of cello and keys. Vocally, Weeks still has his limitations, and during some of the more emotive bits one can't help but wish he had his female Espers co-vocalists by his side. He does periodically receive splendid harmonic support, and not coincidentally it's those songs (""Wet Set"", ""Skelp Level Rd."") on which the hooks sink in immediately. But if you allow it time, the rest of Blood Is Trouble will eventually infuse your more melancholic solitary hours as well.","Latest solo LP from Espers leader Greg Weeks takes him toward the downcast, progressive art-rock vein of Robert Wyatt.

Peace With Every Step,Build an Ark,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47a13d1975652138d01/1:1/w_160/ed2ac16a.gif,2005-01-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1148-peace-with-every-step/,Plug Research,"This is a record best played in near-fatal situations. New Year's Eve 2004: I skittered down to Elk Grove, Calif., on Highway 99 with rain boiling my windshield; obscuring my view save for suburban neons, crimson taillights, and scant highlights of freeway signs only legible from 10 feet away. I was concentrating not on the road but on an office door that I forgot to lock before I left for the weekend; my mind was so focused that I felt I was standing by that door waiting for myself to show up. During that drive, Build an Ark's mantra of ""You gotta have peace and love"" seemed poetic and meaningful-- not that it was ever shallow before. The Ark recorded their antiwar opus, Peace with Every Step, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The L.A. collective boasts 20 Latin-folk and Afro-groove musicians and singers, all rotating duties on songs that range from duets to drum-circles to all-hands-on-deck jams. Among the ranks are 1970s Black Liberation-jazz vets like percussionist Derf Reklaw (the Pharaohs), ex-Motown trombonist Phil Ranelin (Tribe), and vocalist Dwight Trible (Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra). Together, Build an Ark emulate the pantheistic awe of Sun Ra and John Coltrane. Leftfield hip-hop producer Carlos Nino (Ammoncontact) helms the street fair that only ends when the National Guardsman come. The music mainly dwells on the psych-groove tip: Rhodes chords bathe the skies in indigos and golds, brass sections introduce the gospel in veteran's hospitals, and congas and trapkits keep the dance-circle going through dawn and dusk. Hell, they made my New Year's predicament of facing certain death seem like a swinging time. Opener ""You've Gotta Have Freedom"" would make any agrophobe shake hands with everyone who enters a subway station. The tune grooves in a steady bebop cadence with Nate Morgan's Rhodes telling everyone that better days are ahead, ecstatic chants of ""You gotta have peace and love,"" and Joshua Spiegelman's bass clarinet stands in a corner, sees the Light, and then speaks in tongues. ""Vibes From the Tribe"" paints a Latin-groove in pure Technicolor with Ranelin and Spiegelman quipping ""you outta know something"" phrases on trombone and flute. ""Conversations"" and ""Precious, Priceless"" perform a fine, wartime blues as Morgan shimmers his Rhodes like two-second news-clips of butcher's bills in Iraq. ""Don't you feel our wailing?/ Can't you see our cries?/ Our glass is empty/ Oh, please be wise,"" Trible croons to the self-proclaimed guardians of the Free World. ""Love Is Our Nationality"" could be the Ark's most polarizing trac: Peter Harris delivers a pacifist proclamation, ordering soldiers to ""strip off your uniform/ Salute your equal...put down your gun and pick up your baby."" He then declares, ""We are sweet-talking freedom fighters/ We are literary to curious children."" Many people could dismiss Harris and the rest of the Ark as hippies who'd answer an enemy attack by blowing bubbles at them. But there is strength in his voice that cannot be denied-- it's a conviction that can cause warrior societies to fear for their children as their parents view peacetime as dead-time. Baba Alade then picks up a guitar to give a soulful rendition of Willy Wonka's ""Pure Imagination""-- where utopia now goes beyond all edible materialism. It's a great power.","This L.A. collective boasting 20 notable Latin-folk and Afro-groove musicians and vocalists constructs a monster antiwar opus.

Black Mountain,Black Mountain,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4789d034d5c69bf3094/1:1/w_160/d524a893.jpg,2005-01-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1146-black-mountain/,Jagjaguwar,"Prolificacy can be a death knell for a less-than epochal rock band, so Stephen McBean decided to diversify. The fruitful Vancouver singer/songwriter has, over the past few years, spread his yield among no less than three bands-- Pink Mountaintops, Black Mountain, and Jerk With a Bomb-- each exploring slight but intriguing variations on reference-happy rock'n'roll. His latest undertaking is Black Mountain, whose self-titled debut full-length is a rollicking, wildly adventurous reconfiguring of 1960s and 70s nostalgia that's as duty-bound to the present as it is sympathetic to the past. Black Mountain hits somewhere between Jerk With a Bomb's stellar but more straightforward Pyrokinesis and Pink Mountaintops' smarmy, sex-laden brand of vespertine blues-- only jacked up a good 20 decibels. McBean's voice is pleasant and instantly recognizable; having such an established songwriter behind a freshman outing is a tremendous advantage, and Black Mountain seem to know it. When the band aren't venturing on plush, static jams, his coy bluesy vocals tether the songs in familiar melodic space. Svelte and upbeat, opener ""Modern Music"" stands apart from the rest of the album. Over jellybone saxophone and scattershot drumming, McBean and sidekick Amber Webber take jabs at ""another pop explosion"" and claim they ""can't stand all your modern music."" It's a trite argument, but nevertheless one for which Black Mountain makes a compelling case. Ironically, ""Modern Music"" is the album's least anachronistic and, almost as if to spite itself, catchiest number. ""Druganaut"" fits better into the retro regalia the band revere, weaving a loose-limbed vamp that, besides a few simple chord changes, seldom varies but is gradually added to. The vocals don't drop until nearly two minutes in, but the gap is barely noticeable. After the vocals arrive, it's into a series of haymaker guitar stabs and beefy drum fills, followed by a beautiful guitar feature-- spotted with ran-backward licks-- that exemplifies Black Mountain's penchant for texture and sameness within traditionally peripatetic verse-chorus-verse structures. When Black Mountain evoke glue-sniffing shredders of yesteryear such Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin, their technique falls nearer to Galaxie 500 and the Velvet Underground, who forsook showmanship and dug deep in search of music's fundamental soul. ""No Satisfaction""-- with its chunky strumming, honky-tonk piano, radiant plucked guitar and cheap-o sax-- most directly channels those aloof, technically slovenly forebears and, not surprisingly, is this album's best song. But there's nothing overtly sloppy about Black Mountain: Although it often wades in droning, repetitive passages, the album is impressively tight. Some may hear these shopworn melodies and clamor ""bar band."" But if Black Mountain ever tried to make a night-to-night living in blues cover haunts, they'd do it by torching the stage and leaving patrons agog in WTF stares. The Vancouver quintet aren't some cabal of slack beer-bellied crooners; they can play their instruments, they have multi-chord vocabularies and, perhaps most importantly, they know how to give their songs proper recorded treatment. Black Mountain has that golden must-be-analog sound, with the perfect amount of tarnish to make the songs feel lived-in without burying them in fry grease. Interestingly, Black Mountain are least effective at their most unpredictable. ""Heart of Snow"" resists structure, feeling out a plaintive acoustic strum before meeting up with a frail guitar and piano line, which meanders to a tense climax before erupting into a simplistic but captivating odd-time stomp. Unfortunately, the tension is drawn out as the band acquiesces back into a lugubrious Webber vocal passage, quashing the swelling momentum and rendering the eventual resolution less cathartic. ""Don't Run Our Hearts Around"" is the antithesis: the track is mercurial but calculated; its stilted operatic grandeur is a welcome bit of certainty. Orbiting the album's most generic and derivative riff, ""Don't Run Our Hearts Around"" starts with a clarion call-- a booming full-band hit or five-- then settles into a lurching unison guitar figure. The song seesaws for a bit, then has a mood swing and dives into a forlorn interlude, before picking up right where it left off and riding its central riff raw. Black Mountain are about as referential as they come. But despite the obvious touchstones-- which, incidentally, fucking rule-- the band are affable and idiosyncratic enough to win over those who passed on recent retrofits like Comets on Fire's Blue Cathedral or My Morning Jacket's It Still Moves, and make those records' admirers practically cream themselves. Stephen McBean may be playing it safe by partitioning his rep, but the consistency and breadth of his work is staggering amid so many once-and-dones.","Vancouver singer/songwriter Stephen McBean (Pink Mountaintops, Jerk With a Bomb) unveils his best project to date: Black Mountain, a rollicking, wildly adventurous reconfiguring of 1960s and 70s nostalgia that's as duty-bound to the present as it is sympathetic to the past.

Amok,The Late B.P. Helium,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bddbabf31b7dc7156041/1:1/w_160/7234d27b.gif,2005-01-13 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4977-amok/,Orange Twin,"Listening to The Late BP Helium's debut album Amok can be a lot like watching someone sing into a hairbrush in front of the mirror. That particular someone knows all the words and all the vocals and can hit every chord on air guitar, but despite the exuberance and sincerity of the performance, it's never more than mimicry spiked with the narcissistic thrill of playing the rock star. Similarly, Amok is more about imitation than innovation. The Late BP Helium is neither dead nor related in any way to British Petroleum; instead, it's a pseudonym for Bryan Poole, a veteran of Georgia-based bands Elf Power, Great Lakes, and Of Montreal. Poole's debut full-length, which follows the Kumquat Mae EP, is the work of an artist enamored with his own musical forebears-- 70s rock and pop giants like T. Rex and Cheap Trick, as well as Pavement and just about every Elephant 6 band you could name. Wearing his influences on his sleeve isn't necessarily a crime, but he holds too much reverence for his source material, so there's more of Marc Bolan and Bryan Ferry on Amok than of Poole himself. Even if there isn't much here that you haven't already heard on Electric Warrior, In Color, or even The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone, Poole is having a blast on these 11 songs. ""Belief System Derailment Screnario"" trips along herky-jerky, driven by a saxophone groove that bridges the considerable gap between Roxy Music and X-Ray Spex. ""Candy for Everyone"" is a concentrated T. Rex groove complete with a kazoo solo and the album's weakest melody. ""The Emperor's Drone"", which serves as a mid-album intermission, borrows its meditative atmosphere from Can and Kraftwerk. And on ""Curse of the Trial"" Poole sounds almost exactly like S&E;-era Stephen Malkmus as his makeshift backing band drums up a tight indie-pop hook. Amok is at its best when Poole steps out from behind the pseudonym and throws some surprises into the mix. If such occurrences are few and far between, they still redeem the album somewhat. ""The Ballad of Johnny Rad"" takes a break from its propulsive 70s pop charge to indulge a 50s-style guitar solo that morphs into Beach Boys harmonies before sliding right back into its signature hook, neatly summarizing three decades of pop music in only a few seconds. The album's best track, ""They Broke the Speed of Light"", ends with a lengthy coda that grows more exuberant and exciting as it threatens to live up to the song's title. This moment, more than any other, hints at the depths of Poole's pop savvy, if only he weren't so starstruck.","Former Elf Power bassist Bryan ""Helium"" Poole strikes out with this hit-or-miss solo debut.

There Are Giants in the Earth,The '89 Cubs,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcffc0084474cd0c2bde/1:1/w_160/95bcf1e5.jpg,2005-01-13 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2918-there-are-giants-in-the-earth/,Slowdance,"This is something of a backhanded compliment (which is still better than a forehanded insult), but the '89 Cubs are better than you'd expect. A power trio comprised of members of Bright Eyes' backing band, Desaparecidos, and the Good Life, the latest export from ""Omaha's burgeoning music scene"" (to cop a perplexingly behind-the-curve quote from the band's press bio) hews closest to the fizzy, furious pop-punk of Desaparecidos. Many sophisticated listeners have already clicked the ""Back"" arrow on their browser at the first mention of pop-punk, the Disneyland of musical genres, but those who remain might be in for a pleasant surprise. While the '89 Cubs start with the predictable adrenaline boosts and anthemic dynamics of Desaparecidos, early Superchunk, Alkaline Trio, and the Get Up Kids, they leaven these shopworn chord changes with unusual yet intuitively sensible variations, lacing their songs with kinks, hiccups, spaz-outs, and atmospheric passages that constantly refresh their capacity to surprise and engage. I'd call it ""post-pop-punk,"" but I couldn't sleep nights if I were responsible for a new micro-genre in an already overly-specialized musical taxonomy; let's just call it aesthetically ambitious pop-punk with a strong predilection for shoegaze and sweeping, lyrical guitar passages. The opening track, the mini-epic ""Candid Flames"" begins with a longish instrumental segment before Ryan Fox's husky, even-keeled vocals commence, deftly shifting between the gliding expressivities of My Bloody Valentine and slashing, chugging riffs which seem to say: You'll get amped and like it. The wavering, cyclic intro of ""Sorry Tornado"" rolls into a classic 4/4 lead, then into a dense and explosive verse that eventually loops back to the simple melodic figure at its core. ""We Won the Party"" counterpoises syncopated, scorching rock swathed in dissonant feedback against the sort of succinct melodic packets to be found on a Thermals record. For fans of pop-punk, or emo-punk, or however you choose to perceive it, There Are Giants in the Earth could be the sleeper hit of the year (well, of last year-- thanks for bearing with us as we sweep the last dying embers from 2004's cooling hearth). Those of you who usually turn up your noses at such stuff (myself admittedly included) might find it to be a humbling, somewhat furtive pleasure-- with enough intellectual grist to justify playing it in public, but not enough to obscure the sheer exuberance at its core, the '89 Cubs temporarily rejuvenate those dormant mental channels that course with blissful, uncomplicated anima, the ones you felt certain you'd outgrown.","Omaha-based power trio comprised of members of Bright Eyes' backing band, Desaparecidos, and The Good Life turn in a surprisingly not-terrible debut.

Sunset Homes,The Society of Rockets,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69a13d1975652139206/1:1/w_160/a3337192.gif,2005-01-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7799-sunset-homes/,Underpop,"The Society of Rockets used to be known as the Shimmer Kids Underpop Association, and beneath that banner this California ensemble produced an impressively expansionist take on woozy homemade psych-pop. Unfortunately, the Shimmer Kids timed their arrival a couple of years too late to climb aboard the Elephant 6 and Terrastock gravy train, and though records like 2002's The Natural Riot showed great promise, by that point it seemed most listeners were too Olivia Tremor Controlled-out for the group to really enter their audience's collective forebrain. In 2003, after the Shimmer Kids' accomplished The Book of Mirrors EP sank with barely a ripple, the group again assembled in the recording studio, but this time they found their new material to be such a drastic change from their previous work that the result was a reconfigured line-up with the new Society of Rockets name. Gone are the Shimmer Kids' grandiose paisley epics, stuffed to the rafters with dense layers of oddball instrumentation. Instead Sunset Homes reveals a much more sober, pared-back vision of the group as waylaid cosmic cowboys singing around the campfire in a Greyhound station parking lot. An about-face this severe is obviously not made without some risk. Aside from the crystalline vocals of Joshua Babcock, there's virtually nothing here that even the most eagle-eared listener will recognize from the group's former incarnation. And by scaling their arrangements down so significantly, they've placed much more importance upon the quality of their playing and songwriting. Thankfully, however, the songs here are strong enough bear up under the harsh light of day, and on Sunset Homes the Society of Rockets sound as though they've finally staked claim to a sound they can truly make their own. The opening ""O, Sing Transformer"" attempts to make the segue to the new land as comfortable as possible, as Babcock's voice and piano are carried skyward by a lysergic haze of squeezebox and organ. But that gentle reverie ends abruptly with the ramshackle On the Beach stomp of the following ""Untitled"", on which drummer Mike Evans provides the mule kick necessary to fully introduce the group's revamped sound. In another break with the band's lo-fi history, Sunset Homes benefits from an extremely crisp analog production job by Mark Erickson. In the past, the band's predilection for exotic instrumentation would sometimes result in stray accordions or sleigh bells getting completely buried in an amorphous mash. Here instead, every element is rationed more judiciously, and in Erickson's pristine mix each musician's contribution is made that much more potent. The addition of Lorelei David's theremin to the Stones-y ""Too Many Thorns In Your Bed of Roses"" gives the song a satisfyingly precarious wobble, while the inclusion of ingredients like cello, melodica or various spacey sound effects help keep tracks like ""The Flood"" or the lovely ""Never No Fences"" from ever descending into rote alt-country traditionalism. Perhaps the biggest departure for the group is in their lyrics. Where Shimmer Kids' lyrics were a day-glo pastiche of imagery from comic books and the paranoid sci-fi of William Burroughs and Philip K. Dick, here their words are concerned with the resolutely earthbound themes of road weariness, hangovers, and broken friendships. Though at times this newfound realism finds the group nestling uncomfortably close to cliche (particularly on the skimpy album-closing piano pop of ""Let's Make a Scene"") it does force Babcock and company to find new, more honest ways to personalize their voice. In a manner reminiscent of such albums as Wilco's Being There or My Morning Jacket's The Tennessee Fire, Sunset Homes contains the sound of a band just beginning to tap into their full potential, as well as the realization that any attempt to map out this group's future possible destinations will likely prove futile.","Once they were a blissfully poppy psych outfit called Shimmer Kids Underpop Association; now they're...very much something else.

Early Trax / Side Trax,Ministry,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c54413d197565213bf91/1:1/w_160/99fe5db4.jpg,2005-01-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11779-early-trax-side-trax/,Ryko,"Sometimes there is no better escapism than listening to awkward, nauseous music. I had that pleasant misfortune when I spent my junior prom night hanging outside a neighbor's Pontiac that blared Ministry's ""Everyday Is Halloween"". The song seemed about right for good times at home when your friends, acquaintances, and enemies are living fairy tales. Ministry fused the American teenage wasteland with industrial music-- taking the noise out of the galleries, basements, and bridge underpasses and onto the sun-melted, third-generation tapes on so many metalheads' dashboards. Yet, their 1984 goth-disco hit, ""Everyday"" is decadence of a difference sort. The music plods along like a 45 of Bananarama's ""Venus"" spun by a worn turntable belt, while our man Al Jourgensen yowls, ""Well I live with snakes and lizards/ And other things that go bump in the night/ Cos to me everyday is Halloween,"" in a faux Aussie accent like an undead Peter Garrett. Good times, good times. Last year saw a Ministry renaissance. After hang-ups with Bugs Bunny Records, co-mastermind Paul Barker's departure, and skag abuse, the Chicagoans finally regained their dues-- or at least revived 1992. Their 2004 album, Houses of the Molé returned to the glorious horrorshow of Psalm 69, namely the robotized street carnival riot of ""NWO"" (built on Bush Sr.'s declaration of a ""New World Order""). During the same year that saw Bush Jr. stay in power, up came reissues of Jourgensen's trailer-trash funk unit, Revolting Cocks, plus a director's cut of Ministry's landmark entry into Industrial with a capital ""I,"" Twitched. However, the most interesting releases to emerge are Early Trax and Side Trax-- episodes of Ministry's virginity and the venereal diseases it then spread to others. Early is like reading a second grade book report. Actually, the synth-pop that defined Ministry during the early 80s is decent. Hearing electroclash for the past few years somehow immunized me from both the Miami Sound Machine attack on the hexagon drums and Tron-age synths. Early is essentially Twelve Inch Singles repackaged with a few extra remixes and b-sides. The main additions are the fey, Costelloid impression in ""Overkill"" and the passable Sisters of Mercy raveup of ""I'm Falling"". However, the distant factory din can be heard on the previously unreleased oldie, ""He's Angry"", as the percussions echo like clockwork-- loosely akin to the fascist-funk of their later ""Land of Rape and Honey"". Side offers some of the best ideas that Ministry never used during their late-80s heyday, a time when thrash-metal made sense as mechanized blues for the Information Age. Chief among them went to Pailhead, Jorgensen's 1988 one-off with Ian MacKaye, and the curious 1000 Homo DJs, who released a Black Sabbath tribute EP where an uncredited Trent Reznor and Jello Biafra figured in. Urban legends of Ian ""I've gotta Straight Edge"" MacKaye dropping LSD during the Pailhead sessions aside, the songs from their Trait EP offer a deft marriage of postpunk guitar harmonics and conveyor-belt rhythms. ""Don't Stand in Line"" could be industrial's own ""Eye of the Tiger"" (sans the camp), while ""I Will Refuse"" pits MacKaye against the din of a TV-- his lone voice of defiance fading in and out of the ether. 1000 Homo DJs' lone 1991 EP is best remembered for its gutbucket-metal cover of the Sabs' ""Supernaut"" where Mr. Reznor screams in his sleep. It's the happiest I've heard the boy, although Biafra does make a great actor in playing a good ole boy cop harassing a car full of metalheads in ""Hey Asshole"". However, Jorgensen gives a convincing barfly's after-school lecture in the leafblower groove of ""Better Ways"". The rest of Side sounds like sci-fi soundtracks for the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones and the Van Dammes; where commentaries on the human condition and destiny are articulated by M-60 gunfire. PTP (Ministry with longtime collaborator Chris Connelly) delivers ESPN grooves that the Everquest and Quake burnouts might enjoy. Their standout is ""Show Me Your Spine"" from the Robocop soundtrack, which features the priceless orchestra-stab and Skinny Puppy Nivek Ogre's forked-tongue. Much stronger is Acid Horse (the crew versus industrial pioneers Cabaret Voltaire) and the Chicagoan electro-funk of their lone single, ""No Name, No Slogan"". Some purists argue that Ministry ruined industrial music, converting the genre's multimedia terrorism and rawness into mere metal fodder. Perhaps we could have been saved from the mid-90s dreck of bands that major label sold to Hot Topic shoppers if Ministry still aped to be the next Thompson Twins. Nonetheless, Side Trax has a few fresh ideas still worth returning to.","Rykodisc offers two new compilations from Ministry, collecting the duo's early pre-industrial/pro-synthpop years.

KCRW Sounds Eclectic 3,Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8319d034d5c69bf39a6/1:1/w_160/d3e21e9c.jpg,2005-01-13 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2060-kcrw-sounds-eclectic-3/,Palm,"It has been nearly nine years since the U. S. Congress voted to revise and re-imagine the Telecommunications Act of 1934: in 1996-- in a supposed show of support for capitalism and free competition-- Congress (operating under then-President Bill Clinton) effectively eliminated rules restricting the sizes of the companies owning and operating media outlets. Consequently, a freshly deregulated American radio somersaulted through a period of massive and unchecked consolidation, quickly and severely limiting options for helpless consumers. Check it: In the past 10 years, corporate leviathan Clear Channel has gone from owning and operating 25 radio stations to commanding a stifling 1,200-- unsurprisingly, all this skybox-intervention has resulted in one-page playlists, unilateral censorship, and the disintegration of the DJ-as-unique-personality (see, instead, piles of middle-aged men with stupid names hollering obnoxious nonsense into giant microphones). Now, we drag duffel bags of CDs into our cars, buy adapters for our iPods, and think about radio stations the same way we think about Viacom: with disgust. Unfortunately, deregulation-in-favor-of-competition is hardly a phenomenon that's unique to radio (nor is it inherently destructive); likewise, the dourness of contemporary radio is not entirely Clear Channel's fault. Ultimately, Clear Channel was simply the first corporate entity to pounce on an ample opportunity to make more cash by buying up every satellite in sight, acting on perfectly common-- if vaguely depressing-- capitalist itches. Given all this, the continuing prominence of the Santa Monica-based public broadcasting station KCRW, a community service of Santa Monica College, seems even more imperative. Long considered one of the nation's most universally-acclaimed public radio stations-- offering slices of NPR and PRI's programming as well as plenty of locally-grown news and music shows-- KCRW is to the West Coast what WFMU is to the East: a reliable, intensely non-commercial forum for new and emerging talent, determined wholly independently of major label marketing dollars. The results are impressive: KCRW music director Nic Harcourt, host of the station's celebrated weekday morning spot, ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"", can take at least partial responsibility for the stateside ""breaking"" of previously un-backed artists like Sigur Rós, Coldplay, Norah Jones, Dido, and David Gray. (Harcourt credits at least some of his influence to the impossibly car-bound Los Angeles record execs that comprise much of his audience.) Each week, 15 hours of ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"" is condensed into a two-hour best-of, pithily dubbed ""Sounds Eclectic"". This nationally syndicated wrap-up, also hosted by Harcourt, features the week's best live performance and interview, as well as a mix of the show's trademark ""eclectic"" tracks. ""Sounds Eclectic""'s latest promotional compilation, Sounds Eclectic 3"" (which is available for purchase on KCRW's website-- all proceeds directly support the station's music programming), collects the show's best live tracks from 2002 and 2003, and features an impressive lineup, including Interpol's ""Untitled"", Iron & Wine's cover of the Flaming Lips' ""Waiting for A Superman"", Steve Earle's ""Jerusalem"", Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out"", Radiohead's ""Go to Sleep"", and My Morning Jacket's ""One Big Holiday"", among others. All of the performances were recorded directly to two-track digital audio tape, and none have been re-recorded, remixed, or overdubbed, thus preserving all the awkward intimacy of performing rock songs in a radio studio at 10:30 a.m. To this end, the Flaming Lips offer a dawdling, piano-led version of ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt. 1"", in which vocalist Wayne Coyne, mewing careful and soft, manages to sound approximately 11 years old. Given the undeniable intimacy of KCRW's format (and Coyne's child-nightmare lyrics), that pre-adolescent whining becomes oddly, staggeringly appropriate, and ""Yoshimi"" is instantly transcendent-- as chilling as it is charming. My Morning Jacket's live version of ""One Big Holiday"" is equally impressive, their guitar bonanza even more spectacular when captured live, and so palpably ecstatic that you can almost see the hair lassos swinging. The Polyphonic Spree's ""It's the Sun"" booms in full, multi-voiced, psychedelic glory. Welsh songstress Jem coos the dulcet ""Flying High"" over tender acoustic strums (Jem's subsequent record deal with ATO is generally considered a direct result of Harcourt's airplay), murmuring plaintively, each breath captured with impeccable fidelity, making it sound like Jem is curled up in your armchair. The tragic flaw of Sounds Eclectic 3 is that the eclecticism so staunchly implied in the title never actually reveals itself on the compilation: The artists included are (by now) relatively well-known acts, and the comp's curators failed to slip in any of the weird, demo-only discoveries that contributed to ""Morning Becomes Eclectic""'s renown. The bands included are mostly white, from either North America or the UK (save Mexico's Kinky, whose fantastic ""Mirando De Lado"" is an immediate standout), and play quirky variations of radio-friendly pop, folk, and rock. No matter how compelling some of the performances may be, there's not much here to make you sprint off to the record store. (Remember: It has been two to three years since these songs were recorded, and the laws of trickle-down indienomics totally point to your dad being way into Franz Ferdinand right now.) Still, Sounds Eclectic 3 features interesting, extremely well-recorded live cuts, and the price of the disc-- essentially just a small donation to support public broadcasting-- is more than worth it. Last October, incomparable Radio 1 DJ John Peel (posthumously celebrated in Britain's The Observer by former Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker, who wondered: ""To have your own radio show and play just what you like!

Grab That Gun,The Organ,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba31eb335119a49ec97a/1:1/w_160/d525b641.jpg,2005-01-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6083-grab-that-gun/,Mint,"The Organ-- they weren't lying. In fact, there's one right on the first track of their debut album Grab That Gun, buried deep beneath the snappy, melody-bearing picked bass that's the first and most conspicuous indication of where this pipe-driven Vancouver quintet derive their sound. Another tip-off is Katie Sketch's yearning, almost Gregorian vocal delivery. Sulky and chorus-laden, opener ""Brother"" nods to a lengthy roster of rockers emeritus: Morrissey, Joy Division, the Shaggs, Interpol, Blondie, and the Cure-- especially the Cure. But ""Brother"" is no microwave dinner: It's the Organ's best song, a glistening fresh-caught tuna of spot-on nostalgia that casts the brightest of Grab That Gun's fast-burning rays. Rarely have I been as excited by eighth notes as I was hearing the opening bars of ""Brother"" anew. Unfortunately, it's something of a bait and switch: Grab That Gun starts with a bang and rides it for the entirety of its brusque 29 minutes. By the end, it's floundering in pallid melodies, stalled and spent after such a brief time. For many bands, Smiths and Joy Division invocations are about cheap thrills and scoring easy points. The Organ's enthusiasm is a bit more sincere-- the band affect their moody aesthetic as if it were a genetically inherited disorder. But accuracy isn't enough to justify a conservative approach. The Organ must convince us that reverb-swollen dirges laced with heart-melting baritone vocals are a fresh dish in 2005. Grab That Gun makes an ambiguous case. On the bright side, songs like ""Brother"" and ""There Is Nothing I Can Do"" follow trails blazed by On!Air!Library! and Interpol, who are among the more progressive-minded purveyors of new wave and post-punk revivalism. ""There Is Nothing"" is this record's obligatory sorrow-stauncher. Sketch is typically heavy, but awash in phased drums and sprightly guitars her voice takes on a more radiant character. ""Sinking Hearts"" is a paradigm of concision, packing a set of swift, seamless melodic maneuvers-- including Grab That Gun's best chorus-- into a stout two minutes. Elsewhere, however, things feel redundant. Homogenous melodies wash over the album, bleeding into one another and taking on only slightly different hues. The Organ's forebears wrote catchy songs but often grew laborious in their gloom; by contrast, this bunch is much starchier. Grab That Gun strives to resurrect a sound and give it a soft safe spin for posterity's sake, but all it does is take a proven formula that's already been run into the ground and drive it further down. Nestled inside that cozy-- if occasionally fertile-- matrix, they'll have a difficult time making significant ripples.","Hope you like Pat Benatar.

Lowflow,Thomas Fehlmann,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7213d197565213b53d/1:1/w_160/762529c9.jpg,2005-01-12 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3025-lowflow/,Plug Research,"The past 15 years saw a common rite of American manhood: driving through a neighborhood in the dead of night; staring at passersby with a homicidal glint, and trash-compacting your soul with a CD of electro-bass molesting your car's subwoofers. Clichés about ""auto-erotica"" aside, there is something peculiar about having so many egos become inflated by monotonous basslines. I thought about this rite when I first played Thomas Fehlmann's second solo album, Lowflow, in my car's time-tattered, circa-1987 stereo. All of its details-- the choral hums, synth spasms, faux Middle Eastern melodies that could charm garter snakes, etc.-- were lost. Only the depth-charge basslines and clanking hip-hop beats were left. The music itself is now German dub as crunk. This treatment is nothing new as labels like ~scape, Merck, and sometimes one too many glitch-hop artists explored that connection. However, Fehlmann's minimalism admirably scrapes out landscapes with charcoal and flicking watercolors here and there. He also hails from over 25 years of importing Detroit techno into Berlin, engineering/producing The Orb's Earth Day acid-picnics, and contributing to the ~scape and Kompakt labels-- all lending further credibility. Oh, that and the fabulous Bob Mackey-style rendering of a pom-pom on Lowflow's cover, as done by legendary SoCal punk artist Raymond Pettibon. Opener ""Goldhaar"" sketches the album's template with its Hollywood espionage soundtrack of icepick stabs of bass, drilled brass synths that blurt their name, and an odd, droning medieval choir. The following ""Prefab"" continues the tone, spicing in steadier smacks, some decent Middle Eastern reeds and dolphin-like rattles. The too-brief ""Interstellar"" deftly kicks in the crunk through a vintage German digital-dub jaunt, while the briefer (39-second) ""Intertwine"" hammers junk-metal on the one. Elsewhere, Fehlmann further proves that he did his undergraduate studies on Dirty South hip-hop on ""Intersect"" with its marrow-thin handclaps, but the peculiar time-stretched clavichord tone earns his work a ""B-"". As what's common with quite a few German dub artists these days, he sometimes drops Weather Channel soundtracks that try to spice up coverage of seasonal, partly cloudy and 68-degree weather. The guilty are ""Lindt"" and the overpolished Bill Laswell-style dub of ""Slinky"". Fehlmann's biggest strength is treating a dub groove like a storm-drain; allowing random detritus to fall into the rainwater and steadily drift along. ""Springer"" resembles a live band jamming along to a busted ghetto blaster; as ham radio transmissions sputter with a looming machina bassline. ""Andrea Is Delighted"" is a year-in-a-day trance that sets a Kompakt-style whirlpool orchestration to a classic Berlin dub strut that flickers like a skyscraper's office lights gone haywire. The closer, ""Fellmaus"" was a leftfield, grime-dub oddity on ~scape's digital-dub comp, Staeditizism (2000) with its spider-spun cymbals wind chime marimbas, and time-mutating rimshots. That track's inclusion on Lowflow now makes it seem that Fehlmann only gave a 15-percent expression on this album. He's forgiven, but that's quite deadly for a minimalist record.","Berlin-based veteran of electronic music offers a new full-length via Los Angeles' Plug Research label.

Sleeps With Fishes,On Fillmore,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba459d034d5c69bf541e/1:1/w_160/2eb90430.jpg,2005-01-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6103-sleeps-with-fishes/,Quakebasket,"If you're the type who likes to get belligerent about such things, there's an argument to be made that-- Nels Cline or no Nels Cline-- Glenn Kotche has had the most consistently intriguing career of any member of Wilco. (Although heaven help you if you find yourself crossways with a sanctimonious John Stirratt fan.) Both prior to and concurrent with his time in Wilco, Kotche has lent his uniquely expansive style of percussion to a remarkable array of projects, from solo works to stints playing with such acts as the Boxhead Ensemble, Bobby Conn, the Fred Lonberg-Holm Trio, and Simon Joyner. Some of Kotche's most adventurous and satisfying activities have been conducted as one half of On Fillmore, his experimental duo with bassist Darin Gray (another guy who's built himself a weird and wondrous discography with his work in bands like Brise-Glace and Dazzling Killmen.) On Sleeps With Fishes the two utilize double bass, vibraphone, and an inscrutable assortment of tuned percussion and field recordings to create a mesmerizing, pointillist topography; one built of tiny sounds that twinkle like the reflection of fireflies upon an ink-black river. One quick side note: My dog typically ignores all music, usually remaining completely oblivious to whatever crazy sounds might be emanating from my speakers. But for\xCAsome reason Sleeps With Fishes drives her absolutely bananas. The main culprit is the album's first track ""Hikali"", which not only features tapes of what sounds like chirping birds or squirrels but also several bell-like tones that sound, to the unwary, suspiciously like the sound of my doorbell. To the canine mind, all of these collected sounds apparently signal some sort of call to action. Exactly what that action is supposed to entail remains vague, although it certainly seems to require a lot of barking. Hopefully, however, your human response to Sleeps With Fishes will be more subdued though perhaps just as fervent. With Gray's serenely strolling bass anchoring Kotche's shimmering, melodic vibraphone, tracks like ""Hikali"" and ""Taisho"" can be as tranquil as doing a little nightfishing in your neighbor's koi pond using a set of glow-in-the-dark chopsticks. And invariably each of these songs reach a point where gravity fails and their various pixels can no longer hold together, so maybe you'll decide to just settle right into the pond to enjoy an extended float, with the fish generally well-behaved and nibbling on you only occasionally. On shorter tracks like ""Showa"" and ""Asagi"", On Fillmore sound slightly more conventional-- their gauzy, pincushion melodies sounding something like miniature versions of Tortoise's gamelan-inspired tapestries. And on the closing ""Doitsu"" they initially slide into a sleek uptown jazz lope, before the song's swirling double-helix structure gradually dissolves into chiming hiss and static, and this beguiling apparition of an album is appropriately permitted to exit with a whisper.","Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche and bassist Darin Gray offer their latest experimental collaboration.

Strange Bird,Augie March,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b1ea9e61561daa4870/1:1/w_160/d1f178e9.jpg,2005-01-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/463-strange-bird/,BMGBMG,"How many times have you heard that intro? That thundering ""Boom! Ch-chik! Boom!"" that Phil Spector stopped time with on the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" back in 1963, that one that nobody seems to be able to trump 40 years later. It's in ""Just Like Honey"" and ""Everything Must Go"" and ""The Bear"" and ""You Are the Generation Who Bought More Shoes and You Get What You Deserve"" and it sounds just as good every damn time. If a band is stealing this intro, it's probably because it has realized it wasn't going to write a better one. Augie March's sophomore album Strange Bird opens with just this intro, cleverly transferred from the snare and toms to the guitar and hi-hat, but still booming with immediacy. So now that they've got your attention, does this Aussie quintet have anything to say? Quite a lot, it turns out, with an 18-page lyric booklet to spell it out if you become lost in their heavy accents. Such charming accents, though, and more power to them for not trying to sound like they're from Southern California, even as much of their music dives deeply into Brian's sandbox and leans on Spector's Wall of Sound. Strange Bird is a Technicolor pop opus that's so stuffed with ideas and instruments that it's wont to rupture from time to time, as the band's ambition blows away the substance of the songs with organ overdubs and enough Zildjian crashing and bashing to overwhelm the treble. Indeed, if there's a complaint to be made about Strange Bird, it's that there is a surplus of sound. At the end of ""Brundisium"", they sound like three Wrecking Crews, and it distracts a bit from the exquisite melody that the jam overtakes. Likewise, Glenn Richards' rich, soft lead vox on closer ""O Song"" are backed by a wailing accompaniment uttering the same lines low in the mix, a la Pink Floyd's ""Southampton Dock"", and it's slightly too much-- the harmonium and horns had the backing down just fine, thanks. But we're complaining too much here, I'm afraid. There's much more good stuff to talk about than bad. Take opener ""The Vineyard"", for instance. After the Spector tribute, it becomes a languid, labyrinthine ballad stuffed with ghostly harmonies, lovely descending piano parts, wandering backwoods guitar leads and a generally warm, Fridmann/Lips glow that invites you into the band's florid poesy and symphonic arrangement sense. But it's a setup, because while you're adimiring their slow beauty, they blindside you on track two: ""This Train Will Be Taking No Passengers"" is a wailing rockabilly psych raver that chug-a-chugs through verses like ""Onward and on to the ends of love/ Pricked vanity, habit and ruse/ Onward and on to a premature silence/ Where death finds too much use."" Place those lyrics in the shadow of the death of the band's original keyboardist, still fairly fresh in 2002 when this album saw its original Australian release, and they take on other dimensions. Having covered their ground in just two tracks, Augie March set out to refine it and expand it in the 50 or so minutes that follow. ""The Night Is a Blackbird"" is a pretty thing moving at the pace of a Galapagos tortoise, melody upon melody upon melody. ""Up the Hill and Down"" is a horn reverie to introduce ""There's Something at the Bottom of the Black Pool"", which sounds like its title, and ""Addle Brains""? Well, as if the title wasn't already enough, it's a loopy, almost Victorian swinger stuffed as usual with keyboards and character-sketching lines like ""Addle Brains would drink for four days and no eats/ And sleep in the glens of botanical parks/ And on the humped bus shelter seats."" The original Augie March was a character dreamed up by Saul Bellow, a man ""in search of a worthwhile fate,"" and his namesake band, halfway around the world, has nicely found that fate on their second album. Frankly, it's amazing that it took two years for these songs to reach the states-- those folks down in Australia already own an entire continent, so no need to hog the greatest music they produce for themselves as well, right? At any rate, it finally made it here, and is waiting to be heard.","Originally released to thunderous acclaim in their homeland two years ago, the debut from this Aussie indie pop combo hits the states to build steam for the anticipated follow-up.

Osirus: The Official Mixtape,Ol’ Dirty Bastard,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba469d034d5c69bf5420/1:1/w_160/15c07460.jpg,2005-01-12 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6104-osirus-the-official-mixtape/,Sure ShotJC,"In the rap family portrait, Ol' Dirty Bastard was the Downsy 30-year-old cousin with his pants pulled down. Nobody asked him to do this obviously, and though the scene was gross, nobody protested either. Everybody just laughed-- the only option, really. ODB had so successfully blurred the line between playing the fool and actually being retarded, nobody would dare criticize him for fear of seeming pointlessly cruel or, worse, painfully out of the loop. ODB was better than a fool though: Not only did he say and do what others didn't, but where fools get away with their foolishness, ODB fell victim to his own heedlessness at every turn. He lived the life-- cash money, bitches, crack, fast cars, etc.-- but unlike others, ODB always suffered the consequences: poverty, child support, crippling addiction, prison, and traffic violations. ODB was simultaneously everything and nothing most MCs want to be. A few seconds into ""Pop Shots""-- the lead track on the posthumous Osirus: The Official Mixtape-- ODB invokes his most foolish public display, that surprise interruption of Puffy's Grammy acceptance speech in 1998. ""Look here, more money, more problems, my ass/ You're a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real/ That's a trick to try to keep you where you at/ All content, while niggas ridin' Bentleys and Maybach"", the fool says. He's right to chide, wrong to look past the personal contradiction but in the end completely unassailable, if only because he's ODB. At this point only our coolest friends can say, ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"" when they break their own rules. Really though, no one-- maybe not even Rick James himself-- deserves the line more than ODB. Nigga Please made the Superfreak/ODB kinship explicit, and the best tracks on Osirus pin Dirt's ululations and double-edged sex-crazed rants on cold-blooded, rubber-band funk. An early tit-for-tat with Rhymefest on ""Dirty Dirty"" makes the gluttonous ODB sound like a permanent morality play: ""What can make a ho look more cuter?/ Hennessy shots and smoke more buddha/ [I don't know, Dirt, now she look like Jab Zuda/ Test my manhood go get my dick ruler]/ Now you're hungry wanna eat right through her"". Similarly, none of us should ever command a girl, ""Come sit on Mini-Me and put a smile on Dr. Evil,"" as on slow jam ""P*ssy Keep Calling"", but we're happy ODB said it-- if only to remind us that we shouldn't. Says Rhymefest, ""What's rap without Dirt? What's the whole world without Dirt? Just a bunch of fucking water."" Extend the dirt/water boast to the rapper/producer relationship on Osirus, and we get to the mixtape's biggest flaws-- most beats are shit, and guests flow muddily. This isn't The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones Part II, but RZA's production is again sorely missed. When tracks go retro-thug without a hitch (several of them do), ODB just sounds past-prime and pathetic: ""If y'all want war/ let's get it on/ Cause we don't care/ Where y'all from"" is a career nadir. ""Down South"" is, I guess, a Lil Jon crunk send-up, but the song's too listless to make a point of it. However official this mixtape says it is, Osirus is still just a test run for Ol' Dirty Bastard's more official posthumous release on Roc-A-Fella later this year. Which is good news, of course. For every posthumous album, there's a Posthumous Album Game to be played, and hardcore ODB fans will surely pore over his last release hoping to uncover a death prophecy. Perfect fool that he is though, ODB has been hinting at his death since the beginning of his career. Every asinine rhyme he's dropped, every child support check he hasn't paid, every little girl he's saved from a moving vehicle's impact-- from all these, we can be sure ODB intimately understood his fate. Otherwise, wow, what a fucking retard that guy was.","Whoever's handling the craziest Wu-Tang motherfucker's estate has wasted no time in getting out this posthumous ""official mixtape,"" a teaser for his Rocafella finale, due later this yea.

EP,The Fiery Furnaces,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a140b1335d7bf16981eb/1:1/w_160/b4277f39.jpg,2005-01-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3273-ep/,Rough Trade,"Okay, I'm done being a nice guy about this: If you don't like Blueberry Boat, I don't like you. It's no longer a matter of taste, other than the fact that I have good taste, whereas you, Fiery Furnaces-hater, do not. Don't have time to take in the full sweeping grandeur of Blueberry Boat's 80 minutes? I have no respect for your calendar priorities. To those who find their multiple-movement symphonies and keyboard-fetish arrangements overcooked, I feel only loathing, utter disdain, and approximately one tablespoon of pity! And for the few of you that cannot handle the frenetic uber-medley that is a Fiery Furnaces live set, I want to make provocative documentary films about your inept and offensive taste and take them on the festival circuit. But if my depraved fanboy rants and threats don't convince you, this here spartanly-titled EP just might. Dare you infidels bear witness as this collection of the Furnaces' assorted table scraps easily outshines most bands' main course? Not content to merely isolate the most accessible tune from their long players and ship a CD-R out to campus hundred-watts, Eleanor and Matthew Friedberger are prolific vinyl-pressers, releasing new or reinterpreted material betwixt and in conjunction with their albums. EP does the Soulseek virtual crate-digging for Furnaces devotees, collecting most of these odds and sods while wisely catching amnesia on their less-collectible Clash and Fall covers. I know of some misguided souls who find that the accoutrements of Blueberry Boat's three-ring concept album circus overwhelm any songcraft talents the siblings Friedberger originally exhibited on Gallowsbird's Bark, and for these people my hatred burns only slightly less bright. Nevertheless, EP starts off with a trilogy of tunes that should lay this ridiculous claim to rest, restoring their most recent single to its original director's cut. Running a little over 10 minutes, the suite simultaneously reminds the doubters of the Furnaces' considerable pop abilities, while not compromising on the Casio blitzes or thematic density of more recent work. If ""Single Again"", in a slightly expanded take, remains a bit cold in with its jump-rope chant refrain and stiff drums, reinstated bridge ""Here Comes the Summer"", is the perfect thaw, showcasing the duo's deft hand with electronic rhythms, guitar pedals, and swooning melodies. ""Summer"" seasonally segues into ""Evergreen"", the band's sweetest ballad to date, and the first that comes close to making the Carpenters comparisons more than just commentary on the Friedberger's slightly creepy sibling dynamics. There's enough to digest in that opening salvo to fulfill the effort's modest title, but there's still a half-hour smattering of B-sides and remakes for dessert. A few (""Duffer St. George"", ""Smelling Cigarettes"") swerve towards the ADD collage style of Blueberry Boat's longer tracks, telling similarly intricate stories of infidelity, drinking, and gallivanting around London. Matthew's imaginary Cockney accent takes the lead more often than on the full-lengths, whether on the tongue-twisting sea shanty of ""Cousin Chris"" or the Bowie piano-rock of ""Sing for Me"". Meanwhile, the complete reconstruction of ""Tropical Ice-land"" featured here is a taste of the band's Dylan-like compulsion to perennially revise the back catalog, expanding the sing-songy original in every direction, right down to a wonderfully gratuitous backwards-vocal verse. In the end, it's perhaps this quality of perpetual evolution, best exemplified by their delirious live shows, that has me drawing Fiery Furnaces logos on my All-Stars-- few other bands of the indie world seem to have such mercurial aspirations. EP then comes off like a quick appendix to the band's work so far, concentrating their strengths in parts while elsewhere lovingly dumping the stray ideas that may not fit into their next conceptual flight. That it still manages to skirt the hazards of being a for-fan's-only release only deepens my stalker-love, not to mention the accompanying abhorrence for all who don't see the light. Honestly, how do you people wake up in the morning; you pathetic, mouth-breathing [the remaining 1,000 words of diatribe deleted by Pitchfork editors, who cordially apologize to the readership for Mr. Mitchum's unfortunate outburst -Ed.] ","The band we love but you love to hate skip the multipart song cycles on this immediately accessible collection of singles, b-sides, and other rarities.

Box the Bunny,Bunnybrains,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4779d034d5c69bf3090/1:1/w_160/1030499a.gif,2005-01-11 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1145-box-the-bunny/,Narnack,"You've probably never heard of Bunnybrains. Hell, even if you're from their hometown of Danbury, Conn., it's likely you've missed them, even though they've been around in various incarnations for more than a decade. There is a chance that you've seen them without realizing it, though they may have been that group of weirdos with sheets over their heads playing incomprehensible, disorganized psych-rock at top volume before Gas Huffer came on. Their frontman, Dan Bunny, would have screeched like a baboon, maybe burned a book or something and quite possibly yelled at you. It might have been ironic, but God only knows these days. Box the Bunny, a four-CD set of everything the Bunnybrains released from 1993 to 2004, is the apotheosis of bizarre, inexplicable reissues, an unbelievably comprehensive career retrospective of a band that in all likelihood very few people care about. They've even scraped together an interminable DVD of poorly filmed, wicked low-fidelity live performances that I watched in its entirety in the name of journalistic integrity. By the time I got to the just plain weird footage of Dan Bunny gyrating naked, covered in soap with his hands in his crotch I wasn't sure what day it was, what was going on, or why I was still forcing myself to watch. In total, it barely has the appeal of a car wreck. But even without the DVD, four CDs is a lot of music, and it's impossible to sit through all of these particular four CDs in one sitting. I've tried it, and it can't be done-- at least not without the aid of hard, hard drugs. Bunnybrains didn't exactly mature with age, and the stomping, chaotic garage-psych jams on the fourth disc, which comprises the Show Me the Bunny album, sounds about as soupy as and actually less developed than the first, which goes all the way back to their 1993 debut album. The basic sound of Bunnybrains is built from a few simple elements-- heavily distorted guitar, pounding drums and sporadic, gruffly shouted vocals, and in fact the last disc is the least diverse and most listless, consisting almost entirely of thrashing guitar feedback, bass strangled in fuzz and flailing crash cymbal (it seems sort of fitting that the band really devolved over the course of their...um, career doesn't quite seem like the right word). The only respites come from Dan's humorous interjections, particularly his verbatim quotation of the countoff intro to Sweet's ""Ballroom Blitz"" in the opener ""Dan Says Alright"", one of the rare songs with no parentheses in the title (most of them have more than one parenthetical [or bracketed] section). The earlier material is more inspired after all, the band actually managed to get Matador to release one of their albums on vinyl, Bunny Brains Easter (one wonders if Gerard Cosloy lost some kind of bet). You get the occasional Andy Kauffman moment like ""(I'm in the) Bucket (Keith)"", where it sounds like the CD is skipping, complete with the noise of the stuck laser, a smattering of answering machine messages from angry neighbors and skits mostly involving college DJs, but it's still pretty universally ponderous stuff, and there's just no way of getting around the fact that a lot of the material just sucks, and even the stuff that's focused enough to leave an impression, like ""Hello (Reset the Single Malt)"" isn't exactly melodic. It also doesn't bother being either accessible or experimental, and frankly, I've seen dozens of bands playing in Connecticut church basements, high school cafeterias and Elks' clubs who were much better, or at least more distinctive. There are a couple of fairly brilliant moments on the first two discs, and in fact if anything is going to make this unwieldy set worthwhile to anyone, it's undoubtedly the best material on these two volumes. ""Drugs No Way"" is an out-and-out fantastic (and sarcastic) PSA featuring schoolkids singing an anti-drug jingle that out of context could be mistaken for a real Nancy Reagan-approved ditty for fifth graders to sing to their parents. ""Jimboogie"" is credible psych in the Tadpoles vein (though not nearly as good as that band), and the two consecutive versions of ""Model Bitch"" that appeared on their first album are stomping, righteously amateur freakouts that hint at real talent unfortunately hidden elsewhere. It's difficult to imagine anyone but the most rabid 30 or 40 aficionados of American pop culture arcana and rock so obscure it barely qualifies as underground finding much worth in this nonetheless lovingly compiled collection, even with its (low by collectors' standards) $17 price tag. The sad truth is that this doesn't dig up some underappreciated geniuses or lost classics of Northeastern counterculture. It just puts the output of a willfully, justifiably obscure local band in one place for easy consumption. I suppose there's a place for that, but it's a very limited place, and this set ultimately doesn't reward the investment of time it requires.","Four discs and one DVD from...Bunnybrains?

The Wreath,Jason Anderson,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19e5e6ef95969320218/1:1/w_160/cb706b0c.jpg,2005-01-11 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/443-the-wreath/,K,"K Records-- the standard-bearer of all things touchy and feely-- is an apt home for the almost pathologically earnest Jason Anderson. In interviews, he's perennially enthusiastic about unexceptional people and places; about the joys of music for trains, campfire songs, and handholding sing-alongs. His is the rare personality where a Zen-like awareness of the sanctity of the moment, an unremitting gratitude for the gift of existence, and an ostensibly genuine capacity to love strangers are combined into a sort of super-empathy that verges on the grotesque. This deep-seated sensitivity courses sweetly through Anderson's music, which pulls no punches in its pursuit of the bittersweet: Only one song, ""I Was Wrong"", actually has a doleful harmonica, but you can almost hear those spectral strains tacitly bleating over the others. ""Spectral"" is the watchword for The Wreath, which is all about the phantom distance between memory and experience. Anderson is concerned with cataloging what's been lost, what's left behind, and what never was; and with trying to hew meaning from the tropes that float aimlessly through these void spaces. On ""O, Jac!"", a slow-burning lament flickering over a handful of guitar and piano chords, the symbolic language is articulated: an albatross, a bracelet, a noose, a millstone, ""a weird heavy amulet of expectation,"" ghost weights that alchemically transmute the heart from flesh to lead. Like most of the album's more winning songs, it achieves its peak force in its transition from simple quietude to shuddering incandescence, as Anderson trades impassioned cries of ""Where are you?"" with guest vocalist Rachael Jensen. ""If I'm Waiting"" finds Andersen ""slowly embracing the concept of you as a ghost"", a ""never-was and never-will"", as he returns from the thrift store ""to tear through the caller ID"". This is another guitar and piano number embellished with elegiac brass-- ever since Anderson dropped his Wolf Colonel moniker and became self-titled, he's veered away from Guided By Voices style indie rock and toward emo-folk in the vein of Bright Eyes, David Dondero, and Son, Ambulance, all of whom he evokes with remarkable fidelity, down to his confessional / narrative lyrics, his occasional ventures out of key, his penchant for crescendos, swooning blue notes, and febrile vocal vibratos. But in music so intent on preserving the past, nothing can truly disappear, and the old Wolf Colonel still rears his head on lo-fi rockers like ""Citizen's Arrest"" and ""Our Winter"". If it seems odd that someone so attuned to joy sings such gloomy songs, consider what it means to truly love the world and to live with the knowledge that it will all be spirited away. The friction between bliss and the inevitability of bliss's end lies at the heart of The Wreath, a pasteboard carton filled with dog-eared books, a shabby scarf, an unlabelled mix tape, and a sheaf of yellowing letters, holding fast to its secrets in the corner of a bare room. This is mo(u)rning music, where hope and bereavement collide.","Hope and bereavement collide on Jason Anderson's latest K Records release.

Cultural Norms,Blanket Music,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30213d19756521389be/1:1/w_160/6c597237.jpg,2005-01-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/794-cultural-norms/,Hush,"Blanket Music has always sounded ""nice""; that's even the title of their first album. But as founder/frontman/Hush label boss Chad Crouch declares, he's sick of being ""nice."" Their earlier records subscribed to lush bossa nova and soothing, acoustic indie rock, cushioning lyrics that, while smart and witty, never had a victim, and never broke the peace. Blanket Music was nice, and Crouch has decided that doesn't play in today's world. Crouch opens with both barrels in ""You Shouldn't Have Said That"", where he threatens a rock critic over a bad review. (Chad, point taken-- but John Zorn's ""Perfume of a Critic's Burning Flesh"" is, y'know, a catchier track.) But after that, Blanket Music's third studio album, Cultural Norms, takes subtler aim at today's ""cultural norms"", from the everyday (fat kids, filesharing, Grand Theft Auto) to the newsworthy: a gay bride or groom waiting to be married by Gavin Newsom, a soldier's eye view of Bush's Thanksgiving press op in Iraq. Although the lyrics are heavier this time, the music is even catchier than Move, from ""I'm Fat,"" where the hook swirls from a Swiss chocolate-flavored accordion, to the Rhodes and horns on ""Guernica"". Building on sweet and simple indie pop in the vein of Belle and Sebastian, Crouch doesn't let a song go by without a great tune and swinging arrangement, aided by members of the Portland indie syndicate including the Decemberists' Chris Funk and Jenny Conlee, Reclinerland's Michael Johnson on Fender Rhodes, and best of all, the rhythm section of bassist Dave Depper and Greg Lind on drums, who bring muscle and class to Crouch's breezy strumming. But if Crouch is sick of ""nice,"" that doesn't mean he's become nasty-- and his best weapon is his frailest: his voice, a thin reed that sounds ragged and vulnerable to the elements. While his vocal style fits the band, his best moments come when he sings a capella, cooly drawing you in by singing in a vacuum. Most of the lyrics take the form of a monologue, and while they're sometimes too literal or limited by their topicality, they catch the confusion and doubts of the characters, who never decide if what they're seeing is wrong. When Crouch is handling topics as serious as war or as banal as wage-slavery, that tact is crucial: He never hits you over the head with an idea, and what better way to bemoan, say, the trivialization of ""Guernica"", Picasso's major statement against facism, than in a song so breezy that you can dance to it a dozen times without ever hearing the lyrics? Crouch understands the difference between getting in people's faces, and inviting them to come to him. This style of indie pop often takes the latter route, making it easy to overlook but that much more seductive. Maybe Crouch feels that in his nicer, earlier days he didn't work hard enough for the limelight, but he easily could have erred in the other direction by pitching headlong into the cultural wars. Instead, he found a perfect balance, and this is his most compelling album.","Hush Records owner Chad Crouch has a frail voice but he still creates powerful indie pop.

Thè au Harem d'Archiméde,Ricardo Villalobos,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98113d1975652139897/1:1/w_160/294f0ec9.gif,2005-01-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8507-the-au-harem-darchimede/,Perlon,"I suspect that a lot of this tech-house stuff is easy to make. Perhaps process shouldn't be a determining factor in the opinion of a final product, but nevertheless I respond pretty consistently to Kompakt and Force Tracks and especially Perlon releases in part because the tracks just sound more thought-out and labored over. If anything, they're extremely detailed. Sometimes detail work makes us dance harder, and on rare occasions it can even give a track some unexpectedly human quality: Michelangelo Matos talks about the thread of pessimism that courses through Luomo's Vocalcity, for instance. Whatever gives icy tracks like ""Tessio"" or Jan Jelinek's ""Tendency"" such emotional depth, Fruity Loops definitely doesn't have a preset for it-- at least just yet. Blame the detail work, the drugs, or the greasy long hair in his eyes: Ricardo Villalobos' Thè au Harem d'Archiméde is the sound of paranoia, a ticking bomb that never quite goes off. Nine well-carved tracks fidget violently within a remarkably controlled spectrum of sound. While tech-house in 2004 widened its scope for bigger sounds, trading computers for synths and hard grooves for genre and song structure, Villalobos approaches Thè au Harem with a monkish, almost classical degree of top-down restraint. It seems as if the Chilean-Berliner sticks to only seven or eight percussive sounds throughout the whole album, running them through every possible permutation, milking them till they're miraculously warm and woozy. Villalobos gave us great hooks on 2003's Alcachofa; here he stalks us in a sweaty haze of Amazon rhythm, challenging us to find the hooks ourselves. Dizzying and sometimes nerve-wracking, Villalobos is hardly a shyster though, hooking up Thè au Harem's hardest working listeners with fantastic payoffs throughout the mix. While the first three tracks flaunt grooves as tightly-wound as Maurizio twelves, Villalobos still finds an unsettling amount of wiggle room for wind-chime strings in ""Hireklon"", swashbuckling slurps in ""Serpentin"", and noirish synth accents in ""For All Seasons"". As the album progresses, tracks become livelier and more unpredictable, each building on the rhythmic developments of the one before. Lush pun-on-title-track ""Thèorème d'Archiméde"" is the tipping point, thereafter Villalobos insisting on increasingly chaotic routines: ""Temenarc 2"" spins like a shattered Tiefschwarz record, and follow-up ""Temenarc 1"" all but bats its way out of an aluminum trash can. By the time the aptly-named ""True To Myself"" finishes out Thè au Harem, Villalobos has become quite the derelict, offering 14 minutes of weary chants and ghostly yelps. Think Dani Siciliano in Downtown 81 drag, chasing us through the jungle.","Chilean tech-house star Villalobos follows his fantastic and varied Alcachofa LP with a record that displays a monkish, almost classical degree of top-down restraint.

The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou OST,Various Artists,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7019d034d5c69bf36ad/1:1/w_160/d40f606d.gif,2005-01-11 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7895-the-life-aquatic-with-steve-zissou-ost/,Hollywood,"When David Russell's I Heart Huckabees launched its ad campaign, the wacky-wistful commercials used what you could call ""Wes Anderson music""-- 1960s/70s folk pop, light but not MOR, the kind of song that has a strong kick but soft edges. The music to films like Rushmore complimented a style that's drily bittersweet, and so quirky that his critics say he cushions his blows: the plot devices of giant aquariums and Jaguar sharks are too fantastic, real people don't live in the Franny & Zooey world of The Royal Tenenbaums, Gene Hackman never comes out and calls Danny Glover a ""nigger,"" and on and on. Meanwhile, the legion of Anderson's fans who dig the quirk also appreciate the understated but real sadness that runs through the films-- the genuine emotion that's fed by botched dreams and unexpected, unremarkable deaths. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou has proven more exotic and divisive than even Tenenbaums-- check out the 47% fresh rating at Rottentomatoes.com-- and though I'm a diehard Anderson nut, I'm still digesting it, or to paraphrase the old saying, I had trouble seeing the ocean for the millions of brightly-colored, made-up fish. So fittingly, this may be Anderson's most jumbled soundtrack record. The Life Aquatic splits its time between excerpts from the score that are almost too cute, and old rock songs that sound even better than you remembered. The instrumentals take about a third of the album, and they come from both Anderson regular Mark Mothersbaugh and Sven Libaek, whose additions are jazzy and warmly fluid. Libaek's flute propels you more gently than Mothersbaugh's harpsichord, and while Mothersbaugh has the more distinctive style-- and the gorgeous ""Ned's Theme""-- he also sounds like he's writing a score that could either be used by a big-budget movie or by junior high school kids reenacting the same. Sure, that's the point, but it's stronger on the screen. Anderson's soundtracks are most popular for those 1960s and 70s pop songs, as with Rushmore's resurrection of the Creation's ""Making Time"". This time, along with cuts by Iggy and the Stooges, and Mothersbaugh's old band Devo, he uses two tunes from David Bowie's Hunky Dory, including ""Queen Bitch"" and ""Life on Mars"", the centerpiece of the whole soundtrack. As the strings on the chorus foam over like bubbles from a 50-foot-tall washing machine, Bowie's voice cascades in sublime triumph-- though Anderson probably also picked this tune because of the line about the sailors. When he does retreat to a softer folk cushion, he picks curveballs like Joan Baez's ""Here's to You"" as a love theme, or the Zombies' ""The Way I Feel Inside"", which is so plainly pretty and understated that I couldn't predict how it would be used in the film. Then there's Scott Walker's ""30th Century Man"", a minute-and-a-half of golden-throated absurdity: ""See the dwarves and see the giants/ Which one would you choose to be?/ And if you can't get that together/ Here's the answer, here's the key."" (Was this the inspiration for David Brent's songs on The Office? Wait wait guys, gimme back my critic's license-- I promise I'll never make fun of Scott Walker again.) You can decide for yourself if you want to pay the price of two movie tickets for new Mothersbaugh instrumentals and a handful of classics. But one thing sets The Life Aquatic apart from Anderson's last soundtracks: the five songs by Seu Jorge, who sings acoustic versions of Bowie songs in Portuguese. Jorge appears in the cast-- Americans may recognize him as Knockout Ned from City of God-- and these recordings basically come right from the set, as Jorge strums his guitar around the ship. You could treat these as a novelty, but my only complaint is that they didn't throw in more of them; Jorge's beautiful samba version of ""Rebel, Rebel"" and his vigorous ""Starman"" are the record's real highlights. Like Anderson's movies, they're strange, sweet, and revelatory. ","Director Wes Anderson offers yet another of his signature soundtracks for his latest film, to which Mark Mothersbaugh produces another charming score, with help from flautist Sven Libaek. Also present is the usual smattering of 1960s and 70s folk pop songs-- this time from Joan Baez, Scott Walker, and The Zombies-- and a series of acoustic samba covers of David Bowie songs by Life Aquatic co-star Seu Jorge.

Abhayamaudra,Cul de SacDamo Suzuki,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b9ea9e61561daa541b/1:1/w_160/c4450f17.gif,2005-01-10 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1688-abhayamaudra-with-damo-suzuki/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Since returning to performing music in the mid-90s after long layoff, Damo Suzuki has become something of an avant-garde Chuck Berry, schlepping from town to town to jam with local musicians (who by appearing with him become the ""Network"") as part of his Never Ending Tour. In 2002 and 2003, he toured the U.S. and Europe with Cul de Sac as his backing band, but the method conformed to Suzuki's ""instant composition"" dictum: hours after meeting each other for the first time, Suzuki and Cul de Sac played their first show together. Abhayamudra collects 11 long pieces from those tours, most of which range between nine and 20 minutes. Supposedly Suzuki rang up Cul de Sac after hearing one of their albums, and it's not surprising he heard something in the band that he could work with. Early 70s Can is a huge influence on Cul de Sac, and on record they periodically break out an uncanny impersonation of Holger & Co. (see ""Tailing the Strangler"" from the Strangler's Wife soundtrack). In spirit, if not quite sound, we'll probably never get closer than this to a reunion of Suzuki-era Can. Though ""instant composition"" seemingly could lead to chaos, many of these tracks are quite orderly and structured. Cul de Sac's monster rhythm section of Jonathan LaMaster (bass) and Jon Proudman (drums) give the upbeat pieces shape, becoming the hulking mass at the center around which the other players orbit. The opening ""Beograd 1"" has a thrusting beat reminiscent of Eno's ""Third Uncle"" (which, of course, owed a lot to Can) as Glenn Jones lets his guitar bleed feedback all over the tightly measured rhythms. Soaring above it all is Suzuki, ranting at the sky like he's back busking in Munich. Suzuki is really more of a riff-based singer, shrieking out short phrases of sound (don't recognize much here in terms of words) that always exist in direct relation to what the other musicians are doing. On rocking tracks like ""Beograd 1"" and ""Berlin 3"" (where Proudman displays his perfect Jaki Leibezeit tone) the record's promise is realized, and the result is an infectious sense of creative alchemy that can only be described in spiritual terms. For minutes at a time, years of the far-out new ageisms Suzuki has spouted in interviews make perfect sense. But balancing out these sublime moments are a few impressionist soundscape pieces that seem to drag forever. On ""Baltimore 5"" Cul de Sac quivers quietly in the background, spinning out the occasional guitar arpeggio from the cloud of cymbal wash, while Suzuki, mixed too high, babbles on and on. That's the nature of experimentation; sometimes you wind up with a pile of broken beakers and noxious gasses stinking up the lab. You still have to hand it to Suzuki for staying on his utterly unique path for this long, and to Cul de Sac for continuing to challenge themselves. They could be making easier choices at this point in their respective careers, but that would keep them from Abhayamudra's occasional moments of bliss.","Former Can leader Damo Suzuki collects 11 tracks recorded on tour with experimental post-rockers Cul de Sac.

ZE Xmas Record Reloaded 2004,Various Artists,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80ec0084474cd0c0d3c/1:1/w_160/dafb609c.gif,2005-01-10 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2029-ze-xmas-record-reloaded-2004/,ZE,"There ought to be a new name for the day after Christmas. With its discarded trees, glacial lines of benevolent givers at returns and exchanges counters at every shop in the temple, and the beginning of the final week before New Year's-- six days to reflect upon how much you aged and how little you accomplished -- somehow ""Boxing Day"" just doesn't cut it. Until Hallmark designates that day of peace and anticlimax, Parisian ""mutant disco"" label ZE offers two fitting carols from ZE Xmas Record Reloaded 2004, a record on which the resurrected label continues reissuing its Reagan-era backlog of ""no wave"" and avant-disco comps by throwing together its various Xmas Records into one disc. Was (Not Was)'s ""Christmas Time in Motor City"" only sees holiday joy on the Rudolph and snowman paper cut-outs tacked above the window for the welfare office. ""I can't even remember seeing Santa Claus!"" they group-pout to a Funkadelic metal-strut. Yet one bandmate vaguely recalls seeing St. Nick in the unemployment line, and queuing for soup at a shelter that'll 86 him for visiting too many times. Midway through the track, a poet interrupts and reminisces about spending his Christmas feeding pigeons and watching traffic mosey by while hearing ""Silent Night"" on a donut shop radio. This routine of feeling ostracized from the Somebodies also drives Alan Vega's gothic R&B; ballad, ""No More Christmas Blues"". The Suicide frontman perfectly exhales his undead Elvis persona, whimpering and mumbling like an alleyway drunk aglow with red and green Times Square neon: ""This year is going to be different/ I ain't going to be so broke/ I'm going to smile, smile and smile"". Many of the artists here either attempt to pay the bills with easy listening AOR jingles or pout in a corner. Guess which songs make this record worthwhile to buy in July? On ""Things Fall Apart"", Cristina reminisces about broken Christmas tree angels, absentee boyfriends, and parties where nobody knew her name. ""I went back to my flat and wept a bit and fed my cat,"" she concludes over queasy new wave chords. Giving that glum premise a Cathy touch is the Waitresses' ""Christmas Wrapping"". Here, Patty Donahue of ""I Know What Boys Like"" 15-minute fame delivers a dry, schmaltzy reciting of her Christmas letters of ""low and behold"" moments. No Wave tweeker icon James White is a complete bastid as his ""Christmas with Satan"" attests. He imagines hell as the perfect escape from the Christmas hype with a brass section that parodies classic carols and Jewish folk songs with a mouth full of bile and bourbon. White's mockery is a relief after so much AOR dreck on ZE Xmas. I'll keep it short and painless: synth-funk that bends its knees to look funky at an office party (Lisi's ""My Silent Night""); a Brian Wilson homage at Disneyland (Miss OD & Gentlemen League's ""Bells of Christmas""); auto-pilot cheer for when you open your credit-card bills (Lio, Helena Noguerra & Marie France's ""Sleigh Ride""); and John Denver's muppet ghost (Davitt Sigerson's ""It's a Big Country"").","Mutant disco label ZE offers this Christmas hangover cure as underground funk and new wave luminaries like Suicide's Alan Vega, James White, Cristina, and the Waitresses celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.

Advent,Richard Youngs,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aae013d1975652139af6/1:1/w_160/a27ac244.jpg,2005-01-10 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8843-advent/,Jagjaguwar,"Privately issued in 1988 in a batch of 300 and then released on the Table of the Elements label in 1997 before again going out of print, Richard Youngs' debut album Advent has secured a significant underground reputation despite its obscurity. Writer-musician Alan Licht once placed the album on his ""minimal top 10"" list, and The Wire recently included Advent alongside Can, the Stooges, and Neu! in a celebration of their all-time favorite riffs. Now Youngs' longtime label Jagjaguwar reissues the album, allowing curious newcomers the easiest opportunity yet to finally catch a glimpse of this uncompromising, highly-individualized work. In his liner notes for this edition, Youngs refers to Advent as ""a record by an intense young man,"" and after a few spins you're unlikely to detect anything that'd persuade you to disagree. Essentially one 41-minute composition divided into three segments, the album's primary distinguishing characteristic is a hypnotic, two-chord piano figure that pulses with limited variation throughout its entirety. This relentless piano phrase is in fact knotted so loosely that to call it a riff almost feels like an overstatement. As the album progresses the piano begins to scarcely resemble a manmade construction at all, seeming instead a simple, erosive fact of the landscape like a constant wind patiently carving an arch into sandstone or the steady drip of cave-water building a stalactite. Over the course of the album, Youngs proceeds to stage three offensives against this piano's impenetrable bulwarks. On Part I he makes his approach wielding only his plaintive vocals, repeatedly pleading ""don't fall apart,"" in a manner that suggests he's not directly addressing anyone outside his own skull. Though Youngs' vocals have been frequently (and accurately) compared to those of Robert Wyatt, there is also a lonesome quaver in his singing here that recalls Jandek, a resemblance perhaps made more obvious by Youngs' recent and unprecedented live collaboration with the elusive Corwood Industries representative. After that nagging, imperturbable piano emerges from Part I unscathed, Youngs brings out the heavy artillery on Parts II and III. On II he performs extensive surgery (without an anesthetic) on a diseased oboe or two, conjuring a variety of unearthly noises from every sector of the instrument's established range and beyond. Though abrasive, this caterwauling does open a nice hole in the roof to escape through as the claustrophobic walls of piano continue to press in. And the hinges are torn off completely on the 18-minute Part III when Youngs finally resorts to a full frontal electric guitar assault. Forgoing any actual recognizable notes, his guitar unleashes rapturously anarchic sheets of sound, filling the air with red sparks as he sharpens and bends all his blades in a futile attempt to overtake the unyielding piano. Though its harsh and heady minimalism undoubtedly makes Advent a demanding listen (and a potential room-clearer if played amongst the wrong crowd) it remains the most potently concentrated document of Youngs' peculiar and captivating talents.","Privately issued in a batch of 300 copies in 1988, the debut album from minimalist Richard Youngs is now given a wide release by Jagjaguwar.

When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up,Snow Patrol,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4975e6ef959693208e1/1:1/w_160/cf424939.jpg,2005-01-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7305-when-its-all-over-we-still-have-to-clear-up/,Jeepster,"I knew I hated Coldplay even before Snow Patrol released their sparkling third record, Final Straw, with ""Run"" as its anthemic centerpiece, and the British press anointed their lead singer Gary Lightbody 2004's Chris Martin. Lightbody's straightforward songs about the nuances of grown-up romance moved me more than they did Pitchfork reviewer Stephen ""Doozy"" Deusner, but other publications' breathless Rush of Blood comparisons made me queasy. Thankfully, Jeepster has a new distribution deal for Snow Patrol's first two albums, which hadn't been available in the U.S. since 2001. The illicitly downloadable versions of these records-- along with those by side project The Reindeer Section-- were my introduction to Lightbody. Snow Patrol's sophomore release, When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up, somehow slipped under Pitchfork's radar at the time, but nearly all of Final Straw's defining elements were there: naked, lovelorn lyrics, simple melodies, and the occasional whorls of well-placed noise. Everything, that is, except the faintest echo of Gwyneth Paltrow's beau. Where his band's debut, Songs for Polar Bears, tested out a broad expanse of subject material, When It's All Over finds Lightbody discovering his strength as an observer of relationships. Lightbody's narrator is ever aware of his own faults, watching helplessly as he fucks everything up-- though whether he's slept with his lover's best friend or merely stayed out late without calling, it's hard to say. In ""On/Off"", a subtler precursor to later gems like ""Chocolate"" or ""How to Be Dead"", Lightbody confesses, ""I knew it would hurt you, but not like this."" Lightbody idol Lou Barlow might add, ""I know you're lying, too."" Snow Patrol's debut earned them not a few comparisons to fellow Glaswegians Belle & Sebastian, but the disc also touched upon pre-Parklife Blur (""Starfighter Pilot"") and bizarro hip-hop (the unfortunate ""Absolute Gravity""). On the group's second outing, only airy ""Batten Down the Hatch"" and pensive ""Firelight""-- which features piano from then-labelmate Stuart Murdoch-- have much in common with B&S.; Elsewhere, Snow Patrol's arrangements begin to coalesce into the sound that's won them international fame, from the crunching power chords of opener ""Never Gonna Fall in Love Again"" to the gussied-up Sebadoh verses of shoulda-been-hit ""One Night Is Not Enough"". In retrospect, When It's All Over sounds like a trial run for Final Straw. Lightbody's unsparing eye for interpersonal dynamics and his knack for a hook were already worthy of the Barlow comparisons. But the new album's soaring ""bigness""-- likely influenced by Coldplay's now-ubiquitous arena-pop-- is absent. I miss it. Not much, though.","Before the Coldplay-lite Snow Patrol, there was the twee-pop Snow Patrol. Jeepster reissues the 2001 album that bridged the two.

The Secret Migration,Mercury Rev,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43b13d197565213bee9/1:1/w_160/8dfb5443.jpg,2005-01-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5237-the-secret-migration/,V2,"Ever since the mid-90s departure of former lead sideshow David Baker, each successive Mercury Rev album has been a step further from the mayhem. With The Secret Migration, the band completely deserts the peculiarities that distinguished them from both peers and progeny in favor of a dull collection of pastoral fantasias that frequently wander dangerously close to adult contemporary. OK, so nobody expects another Boces from Mercury Rev, but a reasonable derivation of Deserter's Songs or even All Is Dream would be more than what they've offered this time around. Abstaining from the bowed saw or flute solos and startling tempo changes that made previous efforts not only engaging but inestimably influential, Migration is a relatively dry collection of soft-psych fairytales that wouldn't sound out of place whispering through the speakers of a ponytailed yoga instructor. Particularly troubling is ""Black Forest (Lorelei)"", a prolonged dungeon-master's come-on with its checkout counter mysticism and drowsy instrumentation. Singer Jonathan Donahue asks, ""If I were a white horse/ And offered you a ride/ Through a black forest."" Well Jonny, I'd smack you on the ass and give you a good spurring to fire you up a bit. ""Across Yer Ocean"" is similarly lite in both expression and execution, with new age synths and fretless bass triggering a narcoleptic reaction first acquired thanks to repeated Sting marathons at Mom's house. Elsewhere, the results are less laughable but just as uninspired. ""In the Wilderness"", a pounding inquisition, has been done better both by Mercury Rev and Doves. ""In a Funny Way"" turns Phil Spector's ""Be My Baby"" into a hippie husband's anniversary song. ""The Climbing Rose"" unfortunately will come out post-Arcade Fire and cannot match their emotional intensity, supplanting it with a more generic ode to spousal support. The face-savers on Secret Migration are ironically the sparest arrangements. ""My Love"", ""First-Time Mother's Joy (Flying)"", and closer ""Downed Poured the Heavens"" isolate Donahue's delicate vocals by eliminating everything but a McCartney-esque plodding piano chord, creeping guitar vines, and a simple shuffle of the drums. This trio of songs indicates the band's potential divergence from their pals in the Flaming Lips who successfully segued from thrashy psych-punk to acid-washed epics on Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi, all under the watchful eye of Dave Fridmann. Though on Migration, Fridmann's trademark glisten is almost too clean, too precious, sterilizing songs dedicated to personified insects and hugging trees. The disappointment of the album is as much due to an apparent complacency in the songwriting as it is to any sense of nostalgia for what Mercury Rev has done on previous landmarks. The breadth of their influence spans over much of the current indie and mainstream heartthrobs, and that status should be a liberation for a band that made its name on its aggressive experimentation. For the first time, they seem content to sit back instead of lean forward. If that's the case, if Mercury Rev intend to hole up in the Catskills and make front porch music, they'd be better off giving up the schmaltzy mushroom rock and focusing on the noises they can actually make on the front porch.","With Dave Fridmann again at the helm, these one-time experimental indie pop heroes continue their long descent into soft-psych fairy tales.

Be With,Koushik,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc41ea9e61561daa7430/1:1/w_160/a03e8109.jpg,2004-12-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4591-be-with/,Stones Throw,"File under HBA (Hip-hop By Association). The syllogism goes: Stones Throw is a hip-hop label. Koushik Ghosh is on Stones Throw. Therefore, Koushik is hip-hop. Seems cogent enough. But let me tell you, friend-- this doesn't sound much like hip-hop to me. Koushik doesn't rap; he breathily sings, and Be With is more about gauzy collages of ephemeral melodies than hot beats. But, hey, it's on Stones Throw, got to be hip-hop. Genres are tricky like that. Cex made hip-hop safe for Radiohead fans by pretending it was indie rock. If Stones Throw signed Coldplay, would they then become hip-hop? It's a side issue anyway; let's paddle back to shallow waters before it gets any metaphysicaler up in here... Be With collects three vinyl EPs onto one compact disc: Not so hot for DJs, but top-slot for casual listeners. The first four tracks on the album are taken from an upcoming twelve-inch EP of the same name. The middle tracks are from Koushik's 2003 Stones Throw debut, One in a Day, and the final four are from his 2001 Text Records seven-inch, Battle Times. Koushik is a talented producer who's crafted remixes for high profile friends like Four Tet and Manitoba. He cobbles together frugal astral jazz, gentle funk, and 60s pop and folk using an array of keyboards and samplers-- and it's nice. But it frequently fails to transcend nice, leaving behind a scanty impression. Thus does this amalgam of temporally diverse EPs wind up weirdly blank in its total effect. It stretches out in a long, foggy procession of pleasant monotony-- soothing yet mundane aural wallpaper. That said, Koushik's newest material is his strongest, and one understands that the first two EPs were the product of a nascent musician finding his feet. They're spotty, but the third is consistently engaging, beginning with the title track, which reveals Koushik's favorite suspension: Hip-hop drums, a funk bass line, poppy acoustic guitar, jazzy melodic trills and sighing vocals (My Bloody Valentine type shit y'all). The brief ""Homage"" is more typical IDM fare, but displays Koushik's knack for pairing charming melodies with assertive, variegated drum patterns to good effect. And ""Pretty Soon"" begins as a pretty standard folk song (a pretty bleak one at that: ""Pretty soon I'll be ready to die"", Koushik sings in his monochromatic lilt), but quickly accumulates clattering sound effects that conceal this traditional core. The two earlier EPs hold to this formula, but tend to be heavier on drone and lighter on detail: Koushik had yet to achieve the clarity of vision evinced by the new material, and the songs blur one into the next without his current aptitude for effectively juxtaposing soft and hard sounds. But there are still bright, flashing instances amid the filler, and it has to be mentioned that the album's most exciting song is from the first EP-- ""Battle Rhymes for Battle Times"". The track is brocaded with screwball raygun zaps, brassy jazz embellishments, one of Koushik's least tedious vocal performances, and absolutely explosive drums, making the meandering Bitch's Brewisms of the following song, ""Younger Than Today Part 1"", more frustrating. Koushik is hit-or-miss, but his misses aren't disagreeable-- they're simply lackluster. The progression of these EPs shows him tipping toward the hit side of the equation, and I expect Koushik will continue to refine his strengths and downplay his weaknesses on future recordings.","File under HBA (Hip-hop By Association). The syllogism goes: Stones Throw is a hip-hop label. Koushik Ghosh is on Stones ...

Red v Green,Yannis KyriakidesAndy Moor,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4213d197565213b29f/1:1/w_160/03924fa9.gif,2004-12-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4592-red-v-green/,Unsounds,"The musical avant garde is a broad spectrum, encompassing the most extremely austere minimalism and the most jam-packed maximalist statements, the most rigidly structured formalism and the most chaotic improvisation, sounds drawn from nature and generated by man. It's so broad as to render the very term avant garde meaningless as a descriptor, and yet we still know it when we hear it. Yannis Kyriakides and Andy Moor come from different zones of that spectrum, Kyriakides the formal world of electronic composition and Moor the wild world of art punk (with the Ex) and large ensemble free jazz (Corkestra), but their basic desire to color outside the lines is fraternal enough that the two have not only founded the Unsounds label together, they've also recorded an album together for their imprint. The setup is simple: Kyriakides does live programming and sound manipulation while Moor plays guitar and fiddles with a radio. The effect is something approaching minimalism, but too active to fully qualify-- it's actually quite similar the Gilbert/Lewis Wire side project Dome, and anyone who enjoyed that duo's third and fourth albums in particular is quite likely to enjoy this as well. Ex fans looking for an extracurricular fix might find themselves as puzzled as many Wire fans were after hearing Dome. But Moor's trademark six-ton razor-blade attack never makes itself known here-- instead he uses the instrument percussively or stretches out string noise to blend with Kyriakides' static-electric buzzes, twitters and crunches. The guitar sounds as if it's being torn asunder on ""Eel"", a track that stretches and distorts the sound of knocking on the strings into a miniature replica of a black hole. On the other side of that singularity, ""Little Bittern"" is the sound of guitar leaking through a pinhole in the roof, dropping a particle at a time amid trebly buzzing and electronic sloshing noises. While some tracks are haunting, a few are too shapeless to do much harm, and tracks like ""Possible Wheels""-- which drags fumbling percussive sounds out over four-and-a half-minutes-- are the most amoebic. It's these tracks that draw the album a bit past its welcome, but they're very little harm done overall. The reward for making it past ""The Eye on Its Side"" is great, however: the 10-minute closer ""Nocturnal"" is a haunting, suspenseful piece of music built around low-level string noise and a steadily tolling bass tone that sounds like the sort of timbre Harry Partch might have dreamed up on one of his oddball marimbas. It's a stunning conclusion that makes for the album's most affecting (the effect, in this case, being a profound fear of going into dark rooms) moment. Red v Green is a relentlessly abstract affair, but it still manages to get inside you more than many similar records, and it's a fascinating meeting point for two very different constituents of the modern avant garde.","The musical avant garde is a broad spectrum, encompassing the most extremely austere minimalism and the most jam-packed maximalist statements ...

Clicks & Cuts 4,Various Artists,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b3c0084474cd0c0c56/1:1/w_160/5a5e877d.gif,2004-12-16 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1936-clicks-cuts-4/,Mille Plateaux,"Clicks_+_Cuts was supposed to be the future. Right after the Y2K Bug was a dud and modern civilization realized that it didn't have to organize militias to defend top ramen and Wonderbread supplies, Frankfurt electronica label Mille Plateaux announced its ""first genre"" of the 21st century. Clicks_+_Cuts was their vanguard-- a compilation of artists romancing the glitch or, ahem, intentional accidents with their audio software. The triple-disc Clicks & Cuts 2 and Mille Plateaux's tragically underrated Electric Ladyland: Click-Hop Version 1.0 kept the street festival alive for the entire year of 2001, branching off into the virgin lands of microhouse and digital slapstick. And then came the butcher's bill. As revolutions usually go, the CC aged in dog years and died of natural causes. A funeral wake followed within two years when Mille Plateuax dared to release Clicks & Cuts 3. It seemed that the once almighty label began venturing into a marketing firm for Motorola cell phones, cologne, and breath-fresher gum; concocting soundtracks ripe for ladies in off-white unisex bodysuits lounging in matching rooms. The curiosities and mysteries were over. Mille Plateaux had great nerve to revive the Clicks & Cuts series with this fourth volume. Yet, most of its music is terribly comforting. Much of the CC regulars here seemingly draw from the same well of ideas-- Morse Code beats, menthol-lit, jazz organ harmonies, and locust symphonies of clickey-klack glitches. Nonetheless, there is scant homogeny-- it's more of a DJ mix that drizzles time with much breathing space. Frank Elting's ""Spoken Word"" opens with a lackluster, humidifier lounge number. The following ""Got Mad Love"" by Micronost is more promising with a crunk tune that vaguely recalls M's white-bread disco hit, ""Pop Muzik"". Eight Frozen Modules' ""Dogsbark People Grow"" then grooves with coagulated synth harmonies flailing like double-jointed limbs, and a foghorn Rhodes organ blaring hopeless warnings. The majority of CC 4 explores rain-strewn digital decay and the melancholy that entails. Electric Birds' soothing ""When I See the Sun"" ka-thunks along with confused satellite signals and a solarized guitar tone that steams through gutters. Tilman Ehrhorn's ""Clear"" ventures into the loop-jazz territory that is well-staked by Jan Jelinek. Yet, the song is somehow imbued with a greater scope as its digital static sways like birch branches; it bleeds into the amniotic digital-dub of Jay Haze's ""Too Good"" that recalls Vladislav Delay's glory days. Twerk and Thomas Brinkmann toy with oddball field recordings of Japanese chatter. The former's ""Haiiro"" sheds some Rhodes tears whilst a shaving session and a conversation between a Japanese man and kid, the latter's ""Decoupe"" enters an alleyway full of annoyed shouting, offset by some peculiar Geiger Counter funk. Ultra-red's utterly surreal ""Neue Wirtschaft (Freedom of Movement)"" begins with a sample of a rally speaker stressing the importance of defying privatized space, and then falls into spastic microfunk. I wish CC 4 had a cliffhanger ending such as Bizz Circuits' stroboscope horrorshow ""Ghetto Ambient"" instead of Håkan Libdo's anemic dub shrug, ""Lebensformen"". Sebastian Meissner (Bizz) boils a Middle Eastern orchestra in raw diesel, causing it to jitter for dear life, cutting it off when the tension sinks the soul, and proving there is still some kick left in glitch.","The newly minted MillePlateauxMedia bucks the odds and common sense by returning to the seemingly dry Clicks & Cuts well for a fourth time.

The World Is Saved,Stina Nordenstam,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97b13d197565213ae74/1:1/w_160/2451bf2a.jpg,2004-12-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5909-the-world-is-saved/,V2A Walk in the Park,"Stina's previous effort, This Is Stina Nordenstam, was a lush, vibrant record, with the big-name production/engineering duo of Tchad Black and Mitchell Froom fussing and polishing behind the glass. It even featured a few appearances from Suede's Brett Anderson, no stranger to glamor and bombast. Needless to say, it was a departure from the pensive, reclusive noises Stina was best known for, and if this snippet from her online bio (written in prose, but laid out on the screen as a free verse poem) is any indication, it wasn't a welcome departure: ""For so long Stina Nordenstam appeared to be running away. Like escape itself became the destination. Her music was homeless because that's what she wanted it to be. Albums were recorded in Los Angeles; musicians were flown in from all over the world, silly amounts were spent on photo sessions in New York. Until the only constant was her voice."" For The World Is Saved, Stina returned home, writing and recording the record in Stockholm, employing Swedish musicians-- including jazz trumpeter Goran Kajfes and Ken Vandermark collaborator Johan Berthling-- and even setting up her own record label (A Walk in the Park) to issue the record. (A slightly larger recording concern, V2 Records, is co-releasing this album with Stina's modest conglomerate.) As you might imagine, the result of this cautious and introspective effort is a cautious and introspective record. Complex instrumental arrangements abound, and there are plenty of moments where wry humor and sobering truths flourish, but space and silence dominate. As her biography attests, Stina's voice remains a constant throughout her work, whether she's abetted by hyper-processed bells and attenuated whistles or alone with a guitar and studio ambiance. For example, take these lyrics from the first song off the album, ""Get on With Your Life"": ""They put a needle once in my spine/ It took them so long to find it/ I can't get this porn film out of my head/ Let's get on with it."" Stina seemingly enjambs the first two lines when she sings them but pauses midway through the second line, after ""it took them"". Nearly a full measure goes by before she finishes the line. She turns this trick again in the second verse, stopping on the word ""love"" and then, after a few beats, finishing the thought-- ""dies every second"". It's a small detail, but it undoubtedly unsettles the listener. Beyond the way she handles the words, there's the way she sings them, voicing them in a bleached cracking mewl-- at once distraught and disinterested. She doesn't hold notes, there's no melisma or scale exercises, no multi-octave pyrotechnics. She sings the way a 10-year-old girl would sing-- if the 10-year-old had a sore throat and was afraid to annoy her parents. To folks unfamiliar with Stina's work, this seemingly juvenile style of singing could be off-putting. However, an interesting thing happens halfway through this song, around the end of the second verse. When the orchestra-- to this point reticent and timid-- in the background of the chorus decides to gingerly enter the fray with pensive tremulous notes, Stina's recessed wisp of a voice is imbued with a fragile resonance. There are examples of this throughout this album, and her other records as well, and it's what sets her apart from other singers-- she manages to convey a range of nuanced emotions by foregoing superficial emoting, which is no easy feat. In many ways, it's better that she avoids any demonstrative flourishes. The second song on the album, ""Winter Killing"", an incisive portrait of a love triangle-- the narrator is distancing herself from her lover (and her lover's wife)-- wouldn't be nearly as effecting in the throat of a different singer. At first, it seems as though the narrator's departure is a selfishly selfless gesture: I was stopped in customs/ Quite proud of the knack/ I have of knowing/ When it's over."" The narrator takes pride in the distance she's created, insisting ""You're safer with me here/ And you there"". And then, near the end of the song-- against a sparser version of the song's syncopated backdrop-- this bravado is revealed to be a faltering facade: ""You'd made a lover out of me/ And spring was coming."" Instead of her moving away for his sake, she's doing it to keep herself from feeling anything: ""I'm safer with me here/ And you there"". Stina's voice presents this confession in a calm matter-of-fact fashion that belies its devastating impact. The World Is Saved is filled with these sardonic moments. Most of them are a result of Stina's lyrics juxtaposed not only with her voice but atypical musical settings as well. You find yourself sitting on a gorgeously mournful trumpet refrain? Make it into a song about writing snarky postcards to your ex-lover (""From Grand Cayman With Love"")! You want to recast Gregor Samsa as a butterfly instead of a cockroach (""Butterfly"")? Do it with this jaunty toe-tapping junk-driven jalopy! As for the title track, why not use plucked strings, craggy violin bowing, and rumbling xylophones to gleefully pervert the title's sentiment? From the sound of this record, salvation came at a high price. The stories Stina tells, and the means she uses to tell them, paint extraordinary portraits born of hard lessons and harder struggles. If-- as her bio claims-- ""this is some of the most hopeful music"" Stina Nordenstam has ever recorded, it's a sinewy, ragged hope. Even after all that she's been through, there is something to look forward to. ""Yet I hold nothing/ In my arms but my arms"". For better or worse, and with all due apologies to her previous work, this is Stina Nordenstam.","Abandoning the lush, vibrant sound of her previous effort, This Is Stina Nordenstam, the Swedish singer returned to Stockholm and created a cautious, instrospective gem.

Leviathan,Mastodon,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d55e6ef95969323904/1:1/w_160/a18eb893.jpg,2004-12-16 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5143-leviathan/,Relapse,"Famed liberal journalist and political commentator Bill Moyers recently remarked ""I believe that journalism is all about writing in the sand and whistling in the wind. The wind blows the sound away, and the sand flows over the writing. A journalist has impact on his time, if he's lucky."" Sadly, for many of us at Pitchfork, our brand of journalism is often reduced to pounding sand and pissing in the wind-- particularly where metal is involved. With metal, so much effort goes into pasteurizing the product, congealing an intrinsically harsh and offensive form of expression into G-rated drivel, that our wind swallows the sound. What results seldom resembles the melodic and thematic content of sometimes brilliant modern metal albums, and instead focuses on the critic's unquenchable need for primal screams directed at a genre he/she simply doesn't get. I've been away from journalism for the better part of two years. In that time I've sat back and stiffly scrutinized the metal landscape. So much of what I've witnessed is offensive-- both in the arenas of music and music criticism. I've seen dozens of rudderless bands ebb and flow, milking the same old derivative metal props for all they're worth. I've seen an entire genre (black metal) continue its decade-long decay into a wretched puddle of milky white afterbirth. And most notably, I've watched scores of pseudo frat boys reinvent themselves as ""metalheadz."" Whether it's the crystal meth or $10 dollar cases of PBR, these guys have tons of energy, a healthy appreciation for Terrence McKenna, and above all else, a whole lot of noise to make. Unfortunately for these clowns-- and more so for the ""journalists"" who lap up this rubbish-- this wolf in American Eagle clothing is little more than the noise of hyperactive brats. Ample time is spent bemoaning the aesthetics of the so-called true metal as puerile, obsolete, and anachronistic, and at the same time lauding the dubious originality of bands like Isis, Pelican, and Neurosis, who seemingly missed the whole point in the first place by latching onto the very unmetal aesthetic of putting their audience to sleep. And then a band like Mastodon comes along and just clusterfucks the entire landscape for every indie kid who thought they had the whole scene pegged. Starting with their ironically acclaimed 2002 release Remission, Mastodon's Bill Kelliher, Troy Sanders, Brent Hines, and Brann Dailor displayed considerable technicality and staggering chops. Although initially loathed by yours truly, I eventually recognized this album as a turgid-- occasionally murky-- statement from one of the most relentlessly forceful young bands on the Relapse roster. With their 2004 beast, the aptly titled Leviathan, Mastodon finally find their niche as a thinking man's metal band. Blending Voivod's neuro-thrash, Therion's majestic gloom, Morbid Angel's spirit of restless and morphing liquid black melody, and EyeHateGod's Southern rock gone awry, Leviathan is nothing short of supernatural. Evincing a decade's worth of maturity gained in just two short years, Mastodon have authored a bombastic modern interpretation of Herman Melville's Moby Dick, the classic metaphor for mortality's eternal (and unwinnable) struggle with divine injustice. On tracks like the blistering ""I Am Ahab"", the band revels in one of its most tightly structured offerings to date, showing precision and patience roaring with power chords and drummer Brann Dailor's mastery of playing both within and around the groove. With the fusion of guitar stabs and snare hits assaulting the listener like a hammer to the skull, the track evokes the unquenchable vengeance and contempt of Melville's symbolic white whale in a little over two-and-a-half minutes. ""Iron Tusk"" is a particularly resonant ode to Sabbath's raw sludge rock sound; another swollen groove that just grows and flows in circles and waves. What's most impressive about this album is evidenced here: Mastodon have learned how to flaunt their musicianship and still allow a song to evolve. Their confidence is such that they're quite capable of building an awesome wall of drone and harmony and then getting the fuck of its way. Where a band like Isis seems to content to treat the audience like morons and basically repeat the same sound over and over again until it's nothing more than glorified elevator music, Mastodon stumbled onto the delicate art of weaving complexity and sophistication within an audience-respectful format. ""Megaladon"" is an ode to the mythos of early 80s Maiden and Diamond Head-- and a simultaneous tip of the cap to Molly Hatchet with a wonderfully idiosyncratic, and damn near arbitrary trailer park riff before going into full throttle thrash for the remainder of the track. Fusing the narrative trademarks of King Crimson and Slayer, ""Naked Burn"" is one of the more beautiful pieces of Leviathan, a shifting, swaying exercise in orchestration and intelligible vox within a metal format. Marking a stark contrast with Remission, ""Hearts Alive"" continues Mastodon's revisitation of the new wave of British heavy metal-- and homage to the mysticism of the Viking Metal movement-- by unleashing a sweeping 13-minute epic, briefly featuring some of their most gentle vocals to date. Indeed, the addition of actual sung vocals-- while often suicidal to other metal bands-- lends a coherence and humanity to Leviathan basically alien to Remission. Ultimately, there's very little to dislike about Mastodon. The genesis from their marginal 2001 EP Lifesblood to present day has been nothing short of stunning, and I can't imagine why anyone with even half an interest in the preservation of metal as a legitimate art form doesn't have a copy of Leviathan on his shelf. These guys aren't part of the tedious mediocrity they've been lumped in with, nor do they hold any contempt for their audience or their forefathers. They're simply one of the best things we metal fanatics have going for us, and if that's not reason enough to toss Panopticon in the trash, I don't know what is.","Mastodon find their niche as a thinking man's metal band. Blending Voivod's neuro-thrash, Therion's majestic gloom, Morbid Angel's spirit of restless and morphing liquid black melody, and EyeHateGod's Southern rock gone awry, Leviathan is nothing short of supernatural.

Inner North,The Guild League,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c00d13d197565213b9b1/1:1/w_160/c080bfa1.jpg,2004-12-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3660-inner-north/,CandleMatinee,"Many critics, including my managing editor, lamented the newfound lachrymosity of The Lucksmiths' most recent full-length, Naturaliste. But to me, that album's bittersweet tenor (abetted by lead vocalist Tali White's literal one) marked a deepening of emotional range for an Australian outfit that always had a knack for sunny school's-out-for-summer melodies and idyllic Kinks guitar licks but often seemed, well, silly. New, unhurried ballads like ""Sandringham Line"" were growers, but they were also grown-up, and Naturaliste ended up topping my 2003 best-of list. Inner North, White's second outing with side project The Guild League, is more melancholy still (some will say maudlin), but sadder isn't better this time, sadly enough. The first Guild League effort, 2002's Private Transport, reflected the talents of a 16-member outfit including members of such indie-pop groups as The Fairways, The Aislers Set, and Sodastream, recording on both sides of the Pacific. The album's playful travelogue conceit and manifold styles were in keeping with its far-flung creation. The same jangly acoustic guitars, sinuous cello and brazen bursts of horns that enlivened Private Transport remain on Inner North, as do White's clear, Aussie-next-door vocals, which occupy a gorgeous middle ground between Morrissey and Nick Drake. But now the group is down to a core trio of White, guitarist Rodrigo Pintos-Lopez and cellist Cressida Griffiths, all Australian, and I can't shake the feeling they're trying too hard to make up for what White might call the quiet burden of their bandmates' absence. Even White goes overboard like a deep-sea diver, the endlessly melismatic ""please"" in dismal melodrama ""Time Please Gents"" marking his nadir. It's worth remembering that The Guild League began as a vehicle for White's songwriting. Though he sings for The Lucksmiths, the compositions are rarely his (effortlessly elegiac ""What You'll Miss"" being a notable exception). But where the best songs on Private Transport, such as ""Cornflakes"" or ""The Neatest Hand"", boast bouncy melodies and lyrics that find poetry in love's subtle everyday quirks-- ""sugar on cereal,"" ""mixtapes with careful print""-- Inner North stems from the previous record's soporific ""Dangerous Safety"" (dangerous for late-night drivers, heavy-machine operators and sleep-deprived rock writers, that is). That little dirge marked White and co-writer Pintos-Lopez's first songwriting collaboration and-- oh frabjous day-- they've decided to write the entire new album together. There's still a lot to like about Inner North, particularly the familiar Lucksmithian wordplay (""into the morning of last night"") and scattered instants of exuberance (""The Storm"", the strongest song on the album). ""Scientist"" toes the line between schmaltz and true romance nearly as well as Private Transport's finest songs. ""Shot in the Arm"" has the punch of early Lucksmiths and the rapid-fire lyrics of The Guild League's earlier ""Siamese Couplets"". Even ""Animals"", ""Citronella"", and the quietly insistent, love-it-or-hate-it ""Trust"" provide some charming moments. But worshipers of White's other works would do well to take his lyric from ""Fingers of Sun"" as a characteristically quiet caveat: ""It's all coming undone."" Please, please, please don't quit your day job.","Many critics, including my managing editor, lamented the newfound lachrymosity of The Lucksmiths' most recent full-length, Naturaliste. But to me ...

Die Rugged Man Die,R.A. the Rugged Man,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a311ea9e61561daa4bca/1:1/w_160/778ab5d2.jpg,2004-12-15 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6934-die-rugged-man-die/,Nature Sounds,"Die Rugged Man Die has the grit of a classic horror film. From the marshes of Long Island, a man-- better yet, a Rugged Man-- arises to deliver an album so drenched in self-deprecation that listeners bypass any notes of sympathy and gas themselves, if only in solidarity with R.A.'s overwhelming antipathy. R.A. the Rugged Man hates you, but he hates himself more. To be fair, the former Biggie collaborator has a lot to be angry about. Die Rugged Man Die is the autopsy of disaster as R.A. reflects on his heartbreaks and hostilities with a familial bluntness. By the early 90s, R.A.'s future beamed with opportunity. Russell Simmons and the Neptunes courted the raucous underground star before Jive scooped him up in '93. On the brink of celebrity, everything fell apart with Rube Goldberg precision, culminating in R.A.'s release from Jive after a sexual harassment suit and a carnivalesque CMJ showcase that prominently featured saloon-style brawling, tied-up prostitutes, and a gleefully urinating Rugged Man. Since then, R.A. has played the albatross, trekking the underground and garnering reputation as the Chupucabra of the underground. Aside from an appearance on Soundbombing, Vol. 1, R.A. has been an apparition, adding a celebratory import to his Nature Sounds debut. Now, the ghost finally speaks. No one can walk away from Die Rugged Man Die without a clear sense of who R.A. is: The man has a gift for autobiography and he draws the listener with the familiarity of a fireside, storytelling uncle. Granted he's the uncle who takes shits on your face while you sleep. Against Nilez' dawdling guitars on ""A Star is Born"", R.A. regurgitates his griminess as a Jive Records leper: ""'They say he's a beast, he's a creature/ Keep him in the other room, don't let him see Aaliyah."" All vulgar showmanship aside, Rugged Man addresses subjects with clarity and humor. On the album's single ""Lessons"", he deftly caricatures the myopic label execs who stifled his career as a white rapper. Rising producer Koran pushes a pre-school child's vocals over Fischer-Price keyboards as R.A. jests: ""They say maybe if you had Dr. Dre or Timbaland/They say a white boy need a black boy to win/ Bubba Sparxxx did and so did Slim/ Just Blaze is hot. Why don't you get with him?"" Concerned with the trends of hip-hop consumers, R.A. fires a simple critique on the memory-lane ballad ""On the Block"": ""Now that rich kids love [hip-hop], so fuck the poor kids now."" As a composite, however, Die Rugged Man fails to rework the well-worn, preachy ""mainstream=cancer"" equation. Aside from establishing his bad luck with majors, R.A.'s complaints often pose as a subconscious bid for sympathy, which is difficult considering his implosion from self-induced calamities. Why care about R.A's tales if he unflinchingly claims on ""Dumb"" that he doesn't give a fuck about his career? Nonetheless, the completion of Die Rugged Man is a triumph in itself. Hip-hop's Forrest Gump has seen almost everything and tells his story well. Let's hope things at Nature Sounds stay civil so we don't have to wait another decade for his next album.","- The Guild League: Inner North OST

Perhaps that's either because they toss the genre's grainy trashcan beats in favor of gentler, funked-up MIDI rhythms, or because when they sing about fucking someone's brains out they make sure back it up with mundane scene-setters like, ""I'll order a chai tea and you will have the usual au lait"". Either way, Karin and Olof Dreijer have hatched an album that works where so many others fail, proving that fun needn't be spooned with irony. Every pop duo seems to need a gag, and The Knife's is familial: The Dreijers are siblings, and Deep Cuts is teeming with winking incestuous undercurrents. ""I'm in love with your brother,"" sings Karin Dreijer over a popping steel drum melody on ""Pass This On"", and it's unclear if she's being addressed or what. Elsewhere, the lyrics are generally about parties and sex, dating and relationships. But, nevertheless-- topics that few sibling acts would so affably address. The Knife don't seem to care much about how their lyrics are interpreted. Instead, they're preoccupied with cheeky and lascivious synth sounds: hollow, creeping mallet instruments (""One for You""), glowing arena glides (""You Take My Breath Away""), and spitting saw-waves that grab for echoing space (""You Make Me Like Charity""). The varieties usually don't intertwine, except on ""Heartbeats"", Deep Cuts' first single and by far its standout track. Besides being densely layered and exquisitely written, a grandiose, saw-heavy track like ""Heartbeats"" is a wistful, quixotic dancefloor closer. Bands seldom make albums full of songs like these, but you almost wish the Knife did. That's because ""Heartbeats"" is so out of step with the rest of Deep Cuts. Lodged in the opening slot, its plasticized emotional bombast stands apart from the album's general malaise. ""You Make Me Like Charity"" is cheap, austere and vulgar; ""Heartbeats"" is warmer and brimming with existential urgency. Karin conquers her apathy and belts like a less anglophilic Madonna. The beat is thick and shifty, providing a solid foundation for the layers and layers of cascading melody. And though you might expect a track of such intensity to spoil quickly, ""Heartbeats"" has a durable shelf life. Even though its strongest song is a head-scratching blip on the radar, Deep Cuts is still an impressive effort. ""She's Having a Baby"" is as misleading as it is delightfully twisted. Beneath french horn, vacillating sustained pad swells, and Olof's languid vocals, the track's coruscating music box melody suggests something slightly and eerily askew. Elsewhere, ""Girls' Night Out"", with its whirring synth zaps and fast clicking pulse, could score the bomb detonation scene in a techie thriller if not for carpe diem salvos like, ""and we ride through the moonlight, far beyond."" If the Knife want to make merely good records, they need only to make up their mind; but let's hope they strike a balance between the quaking sentimentality of ""Heartbeats"" and the svelte realism of their other songs and start making great ones.","Co-ed sibling electro-pop duo The Knife are out to prove they're more than just the outstanding ""Heartbeats"" single.

In the days before widespread literacy, a ballad was a dramatic (frequently tragic) story-poem that functioned as something of an oral newspaper, constructed simply with recurring rhymes so that it could be easily remembered and repeated. And on her captivating debut album, Ballads of Living and Dying, Marissa Nadler does her small part to return balladry to its vivid and illustrious past. On the surface this might not sound like a compelling proposition, but fortunately Nadler has the sort of voice that you'd follow straight to Hades. Her luxurious, resonant soprano is immediately transfixing, and throughout these songs it envelops the listener like a dense fog rolling in off the moors. Nadler's vocals are highly reminiscent of Hope Sandoval's-- with perhaps the faintest glimmer of the languid phrasing of cabaret chanteuse Marlene Dietrich-- and her unadorned arrangements recall the rain-weary solitude of early Leonard Cohen met with Mazzy Star or Opal at their most hazily narcotic. Nadler is clearly savvy enough in her material to know that a true collection of ballads must include a body count, and the most obviously successful auld school example here is her arrangement of Edgar Allen Poe's poem ""Annabelle Lee"". As you might recall from junior high English, this is a classic tale of ill-starred love with a stretched-by-your-grave finale that fits the ballad form to perfection, and Nadler's melodic rendition here is flawless. And poor Annabelle Lee is not this album's only casualty; there's also ""Virginia"", which respectfully chronicles the death of Virginia Woolf, as well as dreamier, more ambiguous songs like ""Undertaker"" and ""Box of Cedar"" which certainly contain whispers of foreboding for their subjects. Each song on the album comes lightly-dressed, usually borne along by little more than Nadler's voice, her fingerpicked guitars, and ornamental flourishes from the occasional accordion, autoharp, or blurry wisp of feedback. On ""Hay Tantos Muertos"", one the album's loveliest tracks, Nadler branches out from the strict balladic format, quoting lines from Pablo Neruda's haunting ""No Hay Olvido"" (""There Is No Forgetting"") in a manner resembling a traditional Portuguese fado, and on ""Days of Rum"" she busts out a banjo and takes an enchanting turn at a Dock Boggs-style country blues. It's worth noting that, aside from the Poe and Neruda quotes, all of these songs are original compositions rather than the traditional works they appear. Throughout the album Nadler writes and performs with a weathered maturity that belies her young age. In fact, several tracks (""Mayflower May"", ""Days of Rum"", ""Fifty-Five Falls"") seem to be narrated from the perspective of older women looking back upon the adventures and mistakes of their youth. Also an accomplished visual artist, Nadler's lyrics showcase a perceptive eye and a genuine empathy for her creations; and when coupled with that intoxicating voice the resulting landscape is one you may want to get lost in for a century or two.","Debut album from balladeer Marissa Nadler, whose luxurious, resonant soprano are reminiscent of Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval and cabaret stars such as Marlene Dietrich.

World of Echo,Arthur Russell,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f75e6ef9596932053c/1:1/w_160/cd9505f7.jpg,2004-12-15 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6909-world-of-echo/,UpsideUpside,"At first listen, World of Echo sounds like meaningless dreck that barely wakes up to complete a melody or enunciate a single verse of poetry. And Arthur Russell's legacy has never been richer for it. This year's mass rediscovery and mythologization of the late Russell-- an Iowan who seemed to be swinging on a tire over the Mississippi, even when in downtown Manhattan-- was remarkable. Russell's various projects-- including Dinosaur L, Indian Ocean, and Loose Joints-- got feted as textbook examples of ""mutant disco."" His disco was pure clay-- bending, scraping, and glazing its rhythms, harmonies, and vocal arrangements into permanently incomplete sculptures for DJs to puzzle over. Nonetheless, he could still hypnotize dancefloors with dozens of anxious ideas that in the 1980s-- after 1979's white flight from disco-- could only have stemmed from the NYC underground. Soul Jazz's definitive primer, The World of Arthur Russell, and Audika's studio vault dump Calling out of Context both garnered this very obtuse man some retro dignity, for good or ill. Audika now thankfully reissues World of Echo-- a collection of almost deconstructed, ""rough draft"" versions of his singles-- in a limited-edition package with a few b-sides and a DVD of music videos and concert footage. Recorded between 1980 and 1986-- the year in which the collection was originally released-- this material still sounds timeless. It's also Russell's most personal and radical statement: Here, he isn't cloaked in any congas and hi-hats, shouting divas, or ring-a-ding-ding Latin keyboards. It's just his folksy, muppet tenor, cello, and scant electronic microtones-- all lathered with echo, distortion, and reverb. On these tracks, Russell creates beatless dance music that travels through outer space, making the journey his destination. His onomatopoeias and string-work are uncannily percussive and seem to be faintly picked up by radio satellite. His improvisations mine every conceivable sound from his bow and cello's amplified body: hollow thuds, window-washing brushes, chipped strings, knuckled knacks, and the boom of a floor peg dropping on concrete. However, the instrument startlingly duets with his voice, as it breathes along with him and clears its throat during his awkward moments. Whatever lyrics can be understood are stream-of-conscious blurts that exhibit pinhole views of his soul. The opener, ""Tone Bone Kone"", is a baffler. Russell huffs alliterations while his cello ransacks a room to chase after a ringing UFO noise. The following, three-part ""Tower of Meaning - Rabbit's Ears - Home"" is a gently narcotic ballad as he hums perfectly in-tune with his tapestry-weaving chords, uttering odd lines like ""I'm watching out of my ear"" and letting his vocal tones overpower all semantics. The nine-minute trance of ""Soon to Be Innocent Fun - Let's See"" drifts through waters that mirror the moonless sky. As Russell seemingly daydreams of escape from the urban din, he shades and trickles melodies instead of fully playing them. ""Answers Me"" is an afterthought of ""Soon"" as Russell yelps in the same key, ""I'm going where the islands are going,"" while his cello shakes its head with scrapes and mumbling harmonics. The same restlessness drives ""Place I Know - Kid like You"" as Russell drenches his Hendrixian riffs in hydrochloric distortion, as he also does on the backward-looped shimmering of his bluesy space-out, ""Wax the Van."" That song's textures vaguely would resemble the garage-sold Americana of Sonic Youth's Sister if it wasn't for some tacky synth bloops. ""Lucky Cloud"" makes better use of the synthesizer as its tweaked swiggles and bare-boned tones fittingly offset growling strings. ""Let's Go Swimming"" eschews the fidgety Miami electro-funk of the Walter Gibbons mix for a cubistic moment where reverb-polluted drones and squeals give way to flickering chords. Russell then deadpans childlike phrases like ""What country are you swimming to?"" and ""I'm banging on your door in the clear-blue sky"" into a muffled whisper. Once the groove picks up, the music ends. Russell's most poignant moments are when his production's playfulness articulates his fractured thoughts better than any lyrics. On ""Tree House"", he pits his vocals in different rooms, soaking in their acoustics, as if sneaking into his tree house to play hookey. World's finest moment, ""See-Through"", lets his cello's high registers criss-cross about to blanket his dazed sighs that fade into an ether like Polaroids left in the sunlight too long. It's a fitting eulogy. ","Russell's most personal and radical statement consists simply of his folksy tenor, cello, and scant electronic microtones-- all lathered with echo, distortion, and reverb.

Chapter 1: The Sandworm Cometh / Chapter 2: Learning,My Morning Jacket,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42dea9e61561daa80bb/1:1/w_160/66a66c16.jpg,2004-12-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11780-chapter-1-the-sandworm-cometh-chapter-2-learning/,Darla,"If you're a My Morning Jacket fan, you likely know that the band have lots of unreleased material, old tapes, and reel-to-reels scattered around the silo propped against rusting farm equipment and crusted with the hardened wax of a thousand candles. And you probably figured out that unreleased material sounded rough and raw, all those songs saturated in reverb and tape hiss. And you knew scattered among that scattered archive-- long stepped over, or used as coasters for countless beers, or as ashtrays, or piled 10 high for footprops-- there were bound to be a few gems. You were, more or less, right all along, as these two mini-biographies from the band's original label, Darla Records, attest; both are subtitled ""early recordings, b-sides, covers, y mas"" (that's if I'm reading the scribbles along the spines correctly), which is an adequate product description, albeit one that omits a few live versions, several alternate takes, some half-assed doodles, tape experiments, and distractions on a bored Sunday afternoon. Most of these songs, as you could probably guess, feature just Jim James, the voice of My Morning Jacket, either strumming a guitar or playing rudimentary drum rhythms. He ostensibly compiled these tracks for Darla and divided them onto two separate disks. The first, Chapter 1: The Sandworm Cometh, almost has the easy flow of a proper album, beginning with the relatively polished ""Weeks Go By Like Days"", a full-band track from the Darla 100 comp and ending with a faithful cover of Elton John's ""Rocket Man"", which is particularly affecting here because James sounds like he's singing from the void of outer space. In between those two stellar tracks are alternate takes of ""They Ran"" and ""Evelyn Is Not Real"", which would end up My Morning Jacket's debut, The Tennessee Fire, with better arrangements; strong rarities like ""I Just Wanted to Be Your Friend""; some strange, short doodles (""What Will I Do?"" and ""Isobella With the White Umbrella""); a fuzzed-out version of Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit""; and, best of all, a ragged rendition of Santo & Johnny's ""Sleepwalk"" that leads into a live, slowed-down version of the Tennessee Fire track ""Olde Sept. Blues"". Surprisingly, the collection holds together remarkably well as you glimpse the band's creative process through its discarded recordings. Chapter 2: Learning is even more scattershot, both in its songs and in its tracklist. That subtitle is very likely a disclaimer, a tongue-in-cheek caveat to fans who might otherwise expect too much. The demo versions of album tracks like ""Just One Thing"" and ""Death Is the Easy Way"" anchor this volume, but other tracks uproot it. The three frontloaded covers are straightforward, but unlike ""Rocket Man"", they're also unimaginative and almost unlistenable. James peppers the band's straightlaced reading of Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"" with sound clips from Top Gun, which apparently passes for clever. That song is followed by an even greater disaster, an almost note-for-note cover of ""West End Girls"", on which James mimics Neil Tennant's half-spoken delivery without displaying the slightest awareness of the Pet Shop Boys' devastating decadence. But covers are half-serious undertakings anyway, especially on a hodgepodge compilation like this, and besides, James' rendition of ""Dream a Little Dream"" is almost charming-- that is, until he starts puppy-whimpering at the end. Similarly, the full-band version of Hank Williams' ""Why Don't You Love Me"" is a hoot until the drum solo coda, which in the liner notes James calls ""Hot!"" but which might be better described as ""Incredibly annoying!"" This percussive sound spoils ""Nothing 2 Me"" as well, burying a signature My Morning Jacket melody under six feet of reverby drums. This sort of self-sabotage can often sound fascinating if it serves a larger purpose, but here it sounds self-indulgent, juvenile, and-- quite frankly-- openly hostile, as if James is daring you to keep listening. Granted, he gives you good reason to endure all the shrill noise with songs like the live version of ""Bermuda Highway"" and ""I Will Be There When You Die/Sunrides and the Girls Scream"", but that only seems to make the lesser songs all the more grating. At their worst-- which is much of Learning-- these two hodgepodge volumes will interest only the die-hardest of fans, those who probably already own the Darla comps and the European-only EPs. But at their best-- which is most of The Sandworm Cometh-- they offer a compelling if not altogether listenable chronicle of a band with an already prickly creativity and only a nascent idea of what works and what doesn't. Taken together, they're about what you might expect from My Morning Jacket's early stuff, give or take.",,6.9,
Danny the Dog OST,Massive Attack,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ceea9e61561daa7fe2/1:1/w_160/41e6758d.jpg,2004-12-14 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5136-danny-the-dog-ost/,Virgin,"Some folks will tell you that the English Channel is the murky, frigid sleeve of water that divides Great Britain from France. I tend to think of it as the giant crack in a massive ""Best Friends"" necklace, with the Chunnel representing the continual efforts to rejoin the Be-Fri to the st-ends. I mean, did you see the two of them at the Iran nuke negotiations? Darling. The pretend hatred between these two is cuter than Nick and Jessica by a country mile. It was only a matter of time before the ocean-sized heartache between the French and the English manifested itself in a collaborative artistic masterpiece. Until that happens, we'll have to settle for shit like the Danny the Dog soundtrack. First of all, the film, produced by Luc Besson and directed by some guy named Louis Leterrier, aka ""The Terrier"", is a martial arts rehash of Le Femme Nikita starring Jet Li as a man raised as a pitbull, aka a terrier. Eeeeeyeah! If you aren't totally psyched already, you can download the trailer that features Hong Kong's most exciting action star eating ice cream with an irritating teenage girl. If the soundtrack is any indication, the movie will alternate between sleep-inducing banality, weepy sentiment, and dumb stunts. Once upon a time, around the same time actually, brown-nosed critics worldwide were lauding Besson and Massive Attack as the Second Coming in their respective fields. They were changing the direction of art on a grand commercial scale, critically praised, artistically imitated, and publicly consumed. They arguably produced two or three classics apiece, and their money men gave them carte blanche. Besson crapped out The Fifth Element, and Massive Attack took four years to release the outstandingly mediocre 100th Window. Oopsy. I'm not even sure how artists fall this hard. Hopefully, it at least involves a lot of expensive drugs and high-priced whores. Now, like two wounded nobles with hungry commoners storming the castle from all sides, Besson and Massive Attack have banded together. Unfortunately, they are slaughtered and the commoners play soccer with their heads. Massive Attack's efforts here range from the plodding downtempo on the titular ""Danny the Dog"" to Crystal Method outtakes like ""Simple Rules"". In between, is a whole mess of leftfield horse tranquilizers. The internets tell me that the soundtrack is sequenced chronologically, exactly how it appears in the film. If that's true, 90% of the movie will be Jet Li staring out of a window onto the rainy streets of gay Paris, the reflections of the streaking raindrops serving as metaphors for his inner turmoil.","Some folks will tell you that the English Channel is the murky, frigid sleeve of water that divides Great Britain ...

Strong for the Future,Scientific American,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a696b1335d7bf1698e78/1:1/w_160/60444d53.jpg,2004-12-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7796-strong-for-the-future/,Mush,"0. Andrew Rohrmann once played in the Seattle indie band Hush Harbor, and the indie rocker's innate ardor for melody is hardwired into the laptop IDM he creates as Scientific American. Strong for the Future suggests an affinity for Dntel's choppy, hiccupping tunefulness and sonorous percussion, The Flaming Lips's emotive sweep, The Album Leaf's spangled serenity, and Prefuse 73's serrated hip-hop. This is a gently inexorable record that accumulates piece by crystalline piece. 1. ""When it Was Ever Everything"" clearly announces the record's intent: To tenderly envelop the listener in dappling clouds of lunar light, shot through with hot, sparking wires. A recursive circuit of sparse, plucked strings, muffled chimes, and sculpted waves of bass. 2. With its title track, the album rejects the impossibility of voice implied by the first song's amorphous void and opens its mouth to speak. Bootsy Holler's cherubic warbles diffuse across tidal glitch-pop that makes drums sing. Attention Lali Puna: The gauntlet has been thrown. 3. Once an indie dude, always an indie dude. ""Drift in Place"" features guest vocals from 764-Hero's John Atkins, who sounds more like Wayne Coyne than ever, chopped up amid Scientific American's medley of dewy, pointillistic indie electronica. Sublime. 4. ""Victory Hold Still"" gets back to the essence of composition, abstaining from embellishment in favor of denuded elegance. The drums spit like raindrops appearing on a sidewalk. A lonesome cascade of imbricate, synthetic strings carries the melody. A pleasant confection, if less ambitious than its forerunners. 5. After the lulling benevolence of ""Victory Hold Still"", it's doubly galvanizing when all hell breaks loose on ""Between Urban Movements"". Over a modulating EKG tone, crisp drums fall into rigid lockstep and you feel a freestyle coming on. Instead: a sampled belligerent voice diced into infinity. Crunkness ensues. 6. ""Four Hour Window"" slaloms and slithers with pickup like a sonofabitch, zero to max in six seconds flat. A superlative driving-at-night song, shifting fancily around the curves as streetlights roll over the windshield. Sveltely ominous. 7. ""Your Utopia"" : [UNTRANSLATABLE]. The immolated ghost of Ejak's voice commits unnatural atrocities amid a flurry of trembling binary code. Post-human. 8. Back on Earth, it's business as usual. ""Million Lines (Slow Fade)"" spreads out in concentric rings of skittering percussion and a jostling brace of linguistically fallow syllables - all stresses, no glides. Watch for the break. 9. Bootsy's back, sighing and whispering through the mutated waltz of ""The Seas are the Skies"". It gets a little claustrophobic here; you might want to open a window. Unless you're worried about the sea roaring in. 10. ""We All are Already Are"" closes Strong for the Future with an unwieldy title that somewhat reflects the vague meandering within, which has satisfying moments (see the warped piano figure that comes to the fore when the beat drops out), but lacks the focus of the album's hella strong front end. Still, while Strong for the Future's clarity blurs a bit in the late stage, its hermetic, lustrous atmosphere remains intact - a soundtrack for the planetarium.","- Massive Attack: Danny the Dog OST

East Nashville Skyline,Todd Snider,by: Stephen M.

Perhaps knowing, or hoping, he'll have new listeners, he even offers an early caveat: ""My new stuff is nothing like my old stuff was, and neither one is much when compared to the show, which will not be as good as some other one you saw."" That makes any introduction I could write for him useless and redundant. Suffice it to say, Snider has released the wittiest and feistiest album of his career, one that distills the wit, melody, and bristly songwriting of his previous albums into a dozen concentrated songs bolstered by a rowdy backing band that includes long-time cohort Will Kimbrough. As the self-assessing ""Age Like Wine"" suggests, Snider has been in the music business for so long that it's about all he knows: almost every song on East Nashville Skyline is about some other song or some other singer. While this might limit some artists' scope, Snider has thrived on commenting on the music industry-- it was the satirical ""Talkin' Seattle Grunge Rock Blues"" that stood out on his 1994 debut Songs for the Daily Planet. ""Play a Train Song""-- which is set at some beer joint, ostensibly during one of Snider's show-- presents a character sketch about ""the unofficial mayor of East Nashville,"" a hard-living guy who buys into the romance of country music: ""Play a train song,"" he shouts at the band, ""Pour me one more round/ Make 'em leave my boots on when they lay me in the ground."" ""The Ballad of the Kingsmen"" connects the FBI's investigation of the Kingsmen's garbled ""Louie Louie"" to Marilyn Manson's numerous controversies, all of which now seem quaint. The Manson reference is a little dated, but not as much as The Kingsmen, and damned if the Columbine reference doesn't have the force of a gut punch as Snider describes the folly of blaming musicians for such atrocities. He insists he's not preaching, though, and ends the ballad by singing ""Let's Get It On""-- a pitch-perfect punchline on several levels. As ""The Ballad of the Kingsmen"" makes clear, Snider's songs can be surprisingly complex, doubling back on themselves to deepen and complicate their meanings. ""Nashville"" purports to defend the city against its detractors, but the song rolls along on Craig Wright's Memphis boogie piano and extols the virtues of Texas country music and Bluff City piano player Jason D. Williams. But ""there ain't nothin' wrong with Nashville,"" Snider sings, ""that we can't fix in the mix."" Similarly dodgy, the timely ""Conservative Christian, Right Wing Republican, Straight, White, American Males"" (that title just sings itself) isn't just about how those extremists blame ""tree-huggin', peace-lovin', pot-smokin', porn-watchin' lazyass hippies like me"" for the country's problems. Instead, Snider's point is that both sides settle for easy answers to complex problems, finding their solution in pointless blame-placing and muckraking. And Snider has a laugh making his point. Snider's closing cover of ""Enjoy Yourself"" seems to sum up the most valuable lesson he's learned in his long career-- and, fittingly, it's tempered with a little grim humor: ""Enjoy yourself/ It's later than you think."" Even though he's not going to die young, Snider knows he's still going to die. In the meantime, he's looking forward to all those ""cans and cans and cans of beer, and bottles of booze, and bags of pot.""","Veteran singer-songwriter Snider's new album is about the music industry itself-- almost every song is about some other song or some other singer.

Tripper,Efterklang,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfdeb335119a49ecda8/1:1/w_160/aec40fe9.jpg,2004-12-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2916-tripper/,Leaf,"Tripper is the debut full-length by the 10-piece Danish ensemble Efterklang, a band whose name translates literally to ""after-noise"" but more loosely to ""reverberation"" or ""remembrance."" All of these translations are in one way or another appropriate descriptors for the wondrous music created by the group, which settles beautifully into an open area somewhere between the elegant minimalist orchestrations of Max Richter, the electronically-enhanced chamber music of Rachel's albums like Systems/Layers, and the more contemplative moments of Godspeed! You Black Emperor. The most obvious characteristic that separates Efterklang from these other artists is their extensive use of vocals to augment their spacious orchestral sound. The band regularly alternates between male and female lead vocals, and on many tracks it also employs a full Greenlandic choir. In addition, the band's roster now includes the trumpeter Kristina Schjelde, as well as Hildur Arsaelsdottir and Edda Run Olafsdottir from Iceland's Amina string quartet, who have also performed with Sigur Ros. The cumulative weight of these collected voices and players is considerable, imbuing even the group's most fragile melodies with an astonishing degree of dramatic authority. Each track on Tripper is constructed meticulously from the ground up, with a base carpeting of electronically generated beats and effects providing the connective tissue between Efterklang's frequent slow-burning crescendos. On numbers like ""Swarming"" or the exquisite ""Collecting Shields"", every element of sound is patiently introduced in sequence, allowing the listener to become familiar with each layer before subsequent waves of instrumentation arrive to crash and roil. On busier tracks, like album closer ""Chapter 6"", electronic and acoustic elements are integrated less cautiously, resulting in jarring sonic leaps that occasionally require strenuous listening but can prove enthralling if you're willing to put in the concentrative effort. Although most lyrics I can catch seem to be sung in English, I've only been able to pick up on every third word or so, and I'm unable to say what exactly these songs are about. Efterklang's extensive and strategic use of silence, partnered with their recurrent instrumental swells and surges will surely prompt many comparisons to Sigur Ros, and at their best the group is able to fleetingly capture something of the same dream-like, nebulous yearning that has made albums like Agaetis Byrjun or ( ) so endlessly compelling. Though Tripper was a full year in the making-- and the members of Efterklang have obviously given their full attention to even the smallest detail-- the album is not over-composed to the point of sterility. Perhaps it's a credit to the sheer number of cooks in the kitchen, but even with this music's grand scale each song is allowed enough space to be able to breathe on its own. And with their vibrant, continually evolving arrangements, Efterklang here ensures that, as their name implies, this music should continue to reverberate in your memory for a long time to come.","Leaf presents the debut LP from a Danish 10-piece who create music that settles somewhere between the elegant minimalism of Max Richter, the chamber music of Rachel's, and Godspeed!

Three Imaginary Boys [Deluxe Edition],The Cure,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6bf9d034d5c69bf35fa/1:1/w_160/54d7c02d.gif,2004-12-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1694-three-imaginary-boys-deluxe-edition/,Rhino,"This review inaugurates what'll theoretically be a whole series of reviews, as Pitchfork follows Rhino's ""revitalizing"" the entire back catalog of the Cure-- each album wrapped in a modern package, with a bonus disc of associated rarities and a nice glossy linerful of notes and photos. Someday, as the president readjusts her bra, you'll scroll past ads for Suicide Women and find out what this publication really thinks of Bloodflowers; let's leave it to that future-critic to evaluate the Cure as a Big Historical Entity. For the time being, let's just note what this reissue program stands to remind us of: This is a band so idiosyncratic that people hardly even noticed as they remade themselves, drastically, again and again, with an ease that'd make Bowie blush. They made minimalist punk-scene oddities and great gloomy dirges; they made synthpop of both the fey new-wave and grim New Order varieties; they made strangely day-glo pop that used bongos and horns and occasionally pretended to be jazz; they made Disintegration. And all that in more or less its first decade, and all of it without sounding like anything other than The Cure just being The Cure. So we start with this-- a straight-up, sonically-tweaked edition of the group's 1979 UK debut album. Later editions in this series will have the luxury of filling their bonus discs with high-quality outtakes and demos; to this one falls the task of collecting all the wobbly-legged rough takes every band gathers up in its infancy. The result is mostly anthropological-- and, yes, it's difficult to imagine anyone but die-hards and vintage punk enthusiasts needing a live rendition of a song called ""Heroin Face"". But the story told by the first half of these bonuses is a fascinating one. Everyone familiar with bootlegs of a skinny 18-year-old Robert Smith and a band called the Easy Cure will recognize the sound, essentially that of the punk band that wasn't. Because no matter how much they try to sound hard, no matter how classically 1977 they get (""fiery"" guitar solos!), and no matter how close they come to sounding like an Edward Gorey version of The Buzzcocks, you can hear something else bubbling up. And over the series of ""home demos"" that follows-- almost embarrassingly private ones, as if stolen from Lol Tolhurst's attic-- you can practically hear Smith realizing what that something is: He's interested in off-kilter pop songwriting, not the straight-ahead rush of punk; he's interested in slinky Roxy Music atmosphere and a dreamy, imaginary East, not gritty social realism. You might not spent hours relistening to a cheapy bedroom rough-draft of ""10:15 Saturday Night""-- or even its first-run studio demo-- but as a chance to hear a band become itself, it's remarkable. That's particularly true when the early result is something like Three Imaginary Boys, as original a record as anything else to spin off from the tail end of punk. These recordings are spare and simple-- just three guys in a room playing clean, clear lines and letting them ring. And yet everything snaps together like clockwork, from the ingenious songwriting to the precise performances to the decades-long thrill of Smith's voice. This is the simplicity of punk gone suddenly complex and spooky and sneakily psychedelic, whether it's on the creeping tick-tock thrill of ""10:15 Saturday Night"" or the sneering weirdness of ""So What"", which has Smith yelping the text of a coupon offer from a bag of sugar. In spots such as the effortlessly, idiosyncratically gemlike ""Fire in Cairo"" and the bouncy, apocalyptic ""Grinding Halt""-- both of which share some of the weightless charm that put ""Boys Don't Cry"" in the middle-school alternateen canon well into the 90s-- it's odd and quirky. In others, it spreads out the echo and gets slinky, trending toward later gloom. Is this what a new wave Wire might have sounded like, if they were better musicians and smoked opium and were interested in being sexy? Is this what a new wave Joy Division might have sounded like if they went for dreamy, guarded neurosis over the whole raw-passion thing? This is as bold as I'll get: Had The Cure retired after making this record, instead of complicating our appraisals with a whole ensuing career, this LP would be feted as an after-punk gem, a shinier oddball cousin to the current canon. And through the second half of that bonus disc, we come to the less anthropological material that backs it up: album outtakes, rarities, live tracks, singles. The dream-pretty ""Winter"" fills out the echo and points to the future; ""World War"" might be the band's last raw sneer. We'll spare the incomparably geeky discussion that could be had about the singles, running to alternate international releases and outdated collections and recent box sets: Suffice to say that you do get ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Jumping Someone Else's Train"", the latter one of the band's snappiest, sharpest, and most natural early tunes. Listening to ""Plastic Passion"" or ""Killing an Arab"" will, for better or worse, involve purchasing other Cure product. But this Cure product is a nice Cure product, no matter how little the casual fan needs basement-grotty demos or early live recordings. And it bodes well for a series of comparable packages, moving point by point through a catalog so broad and brilliant that it contains pockets and corners you can genuinely forget. Onward, then, until everyone's shocked and amazed to discover ""The Caterpillar"". ","Rhino Records kicks off its Cure reissue campaign with the first U.S. release of the band's 1979 debut LP, Three Imaginary Boys. The newly packaged record, naturally, features a second disc of outtakes, demos, and other curios, as well as a expanded (beautiful) packaging.

Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light,Afrika Bambaataa,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a475ea9e61561daa4eef/1:1/w_160/02c14138.jpg,2004-12-13 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1143-dark-matter-moving-at-the-speed-of-light/,Tommy Boy,"In 1977, Kevin Donovan appropriated the name of a 19th Century Zulu chief, began throwing Bronx block parties, and became one of the elite DJs of the early hip hop scene. He cut his funk 45s with Kraftwerk and helped to found the conscious, Afrocentric Zulu Nation movement, which briefly rose to prominence in the rap world in the late 80s and early 90s. As Afrika Bambaataa, he changed music forever in the space of just two 1982 singles, the sublime slices of electro-rap ""Planet Rock"" and ""Looking for the Perfect Beat"". So, given his hip-hop deity status, you'll forgive me for cutting him some slack as he continues his quest for the perfect beat at age 44. By the sound of things, Bambaataa is influenced today by all of the things his early records influenced-- big beat, house, electro, hip hop. It's funny to hear the updated beats and tougher low-end of the 00s paired with the stiff cadence of ultra-old-school rap; the way it's so unabashedly corny is an anachronism, but an entertaining one. A casual survey of the lyrics reveals that the most commonly uttered words by Bambaataa's latest Zulu Nation crew are ""Afrika"" and ""Bambaataa,"" followed closely by ""Zulu Nation,"" but it's impossible to call it boastful-- they just seem to be celebrating their ability to make funky dance music and have a good time. And it is a good time, uptempo and stuffed with spiky synth, the occasional scratch, catchy chant, and-- of course-- a parade of thumping, charismatic beats. ""Got That Vibe"" opens the album with a wicked sitar sample and a killer rhythm track and they're off, complete with covers of Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango's amazing 1972 club hit ""Soul Makossa"" and Gary Numan's ""Metal"". Numan even shows up to sing on ""Metal"", sounding like he has about 80 marbles in his mouth. ""2137"" and ""Almighty Rah"" show shades of ""Planet Rock"" with their tossed salad of bright beats and dark keyboards and it's on those songs that the reverb reaches Lee Perry levels, with MCs and soul samples echoing like crazy. Unfortunately, when they could have stopped it at 12 tracks and had a pretty good party on their hands (provided they switched out the awful, overly repetitive ""Pick Up on This"" with the wild dancefloor rave-up ""Meet Me at the Party""), they kept right on going, and it stops being fun after a certain point-- especially when songs like ""Electro Salsa"" don't develop at all. At any rate, I never expected a masterpiece from Bambaataa at this stage of the game, and Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light is, as one might reasonably expect, not a masterpiece. It's also not essential listening-- Tommy Boy's Looking for the Perfect Beat comp is probably all the Bambaataa most people will ever need-- but it sure is fun.","In 1977, Kevin Donovan appropriated the name of a 19th Century Zulu chief, began throwing Bronx block parties, and became ...

Midnight Movies,Midnight Movies,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5345e6ef95969323a77/1:1/w_160/c3d99be2.jpg,2004-12-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5624-midnight-movies/,Emperor Norton,"Judging from the press for Midnight Movies, you'd think Nico's stinky corpse had been exhumed from the Grunewald Forest and propped up on the east side of Los Angeles. While there may be no shortage of high cheek-boned talent leeches in town, I've yet to hear any firsthand accounts of a 66-year-old Bavarian cadaver wandering about. This, I'm sure, will be good news to Gena Olivier's parents as I'm sure she's been telling them for years that she, in fact, is the lead singer of Midnight Movies. While Olivier's ghostly baritone does occasionally hint at the Chelsea Girl's narco-drone-- especially when she drops tone at the end of a line-- she pairs the gloom with a winsome lilt that indicates actual emotion, all while pounding away on her drum kit. The easy comparisons are the nagging wench for Midnight Movies, though, and they don't stop with the singer. Guitarist Larry Schemel and keyboardist Jason Hammons blend the sprawl of Trail of Dead and Clinic's thundering hum with Stereolab's electronic flourishes, blanketing the album in a foreboding amber-tinted haze. At times though, having such contemporary influences arrests the record's momentum, particularly when they are not hidden all that well-- ""Just To Play"" damn near samples the intro to Walking With Thee's ""Harmony"". The band's saving grace is its commitment to and execution of its textural aesthetic, owing as much to David Lynch's oneiric odes to Los Angeles as any musical counterpart. Midnight Movies shoots for a fevered dream in which the broad day's shadows and the night beyond the headlights are equally ominous, and more often than not, it succeeds. Schemel and Hammons' melodies lurk and lunge where necessary, and Olivier taps out the telltale heartbeat. Olivier's lyrics frequently resemble the diary of an apparition doomed to haunt the bearded and black-rimmed corners of neighborhood dives. On ""Human Mind Trap"" she mourns, ""Pondering inside her grave/hopeless knowing there's no end/she cries and cries"". Elsewhere, she sounds like the crazy girl who slipped pages of Gorey into your locker scribbled with poetry, most preciously on ""Words For A Love Song"", literally a laundry list of apt vocab. And here's where the Nico comparison is relevant because it is Olivier's voice as instrument that is most compelling, much in the same way that Reed, Dylan, and Cale manipulated the German ice queen's voice to reflect the intention of their compositions. If Midnight Movies sucked you'd have read a list of influences like Lauper, Yankovic and Har Mar instead of what's above. Some bands are lucky enough to get paid to find their sound. Some never find it. If Midnight Movies don't allow hype to flop their buttocks over their ears, they should be just fine.","Leader of the Zulu Nation and legendary hip-hop/electro pioneer issues his first album on Tommy Boy since his 1986 classic, Planet Rock: The Album.

Skittish/Rockity Roll,Mike Doughty,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9beb335119a49eca97/1:1/w_160/c5ae6e76.gif,2004-12-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11724-skittishrockity-roll/,ATO,"Mike Doughty's transformation from mid-90s white-boy-rapping boho/jazzbo spoken-word vocalist for Soul Coughing to acoustic guitar-toting singer/songwriter has been a curious development. It's a little startling hearing the man who barked and onomatopoeia'ed songs like ""Casiotone Nation"" and ""Uh Zoom Zip"" now singing on Skittish, his first solo album, which was recorded in 1996, released with extremely minimal packaging through his web site in 1999, and finally re-released with the follow-up Rockity Roll by ATO Records this year. But Doughty's soft-rock proclivities shouldn't especially surprise anyone: Ruby Vroom ended with the gentle ""Janine"", a duet with his answering machine that informs almost everything on Skittish. What is really curious, however, is hearing Doughty's reedy voice sound so much deeper and grainier; stripped of his jolting irony, he sounds not just sincere, but genuinely wounded and much older, even though the album was recorded almost eight years ago. And there are others reasons this acoustic context is a little confounding: over three albums Soul Coughing worked a chaotic sampling aesthetic that played Doughty's half-spoken, half-scatted observations against a frenetic backdrop of funky drums, jazz bass, and Mark de Gli Antoni's samples, which sounded like another instrument altogether. By contrast, Skittish-- minimally produced by Kramer-- is mostly Doughty playing acoustic guitar and singing more traditional songs that he claims the other members of Soul Coughing refused to entertain. On the whole, they are love songs and they convey edgier, more complex emotions than he was able to express with his former band. Skittish begins with ""The Only Answer"", about meeting a new lover and all the excitement that comes with a new relationship. Doughty reveals his hopefulness in his snappy cover of Mary J. Blige's ""Real Love"" and expresses reservations in ""Shunned + Falsified"". The progression from track 1 to track 12 has the arc of a narrative, which makes ""Rising Sign"", the final track, all the more powerful, especially when Doughty sings ""I resent the way you make me like myself."" That statement sounds especially hard-won, and Skittish possesses the organic perfection of an album that needed desperately to be made, as if Doughty couldn't keep the songs inside anymore. They burble out freely and fully, and despite the minor flourishes of orchestra and organ on ""No Peace, Los Angeles"" and the bass rhythms on ""Looks,"" the overall effect remains elemental, unadorned, solitary. It's an aesthetic that he could not-- and apparently had no desire to-- maintain. Released through his web site in 2003, Rockity Roll dresses up similar, but lesser, songs in dinky keyboards and drum machines, and yet, for everything he adds, this mini-album seems to lose something. It sounds neither as immediate nor as fascinating as its predecessor, which is a comparative criticism but still reflects on Rockity Roll itself. To an extent, these six songs live and die with Pat Dillett's crisp, but often textureless, production: ""Ways + Means"" employs the same bouncy rhythms as ""Circles"" from Soul Coughing's slick swan song El Oso, and ""27 Jennifers"" sounds merely clever, its romantic sentiment lost among the drums and keyboards. But ""Down on the River by the Sugar Plant"" resonates with its frosty, noir-ish atmosphere and Doughty's precisely evocative lyrics about street merchants and heavy earrings, and ""40 Grand in the Hole"" offers an affecting-- and somewhat uncomfortable-- assessment of Doughty's financial, creative, and drug problems. To tempt diehard fans who purchased both albums directly from Doughty's web site or merchandise table-- and who very likely bought the live disk he's selling now-- ATO has appended five bonus tracks to Rockity Roll. The two live cuts were culled from his Bonnaroo appearance, but neither adds much to its original. The studio version of ""Move On"", from The Future Soundtrack of America compilation, was one of that collection's and this year's best and most measured protest songs, if only for professing simultaneous love for and exasperation with America. But this stage version loses the walking rhythm that made the original sound so neighborly, as if Doughty had written and recorded it while strolling through the boroughs. And that seems to be the key to Doughty's charms as a solo musician: as these two releases make clear, he is at his best when he's at his most unassuming, when it sounds like he just picked up his guitar and sang whatever came to mind.","Former Soul Coughing singer/speaker/mumbler combines two low-key 1990s solo records into one new uglier package.

Doll in the Box / Sleep It Off,Cristina,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a721c0084474cd0c0b0b/1:1/w_160/51d4ae8e.jpg,2004-12-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11707-doll-in-the-box-sleep-it-off/,ZE,"Turning campy vintage disco into smoky, dark-humored cinematic theater, New York City dance maven Cristina was too weird and forward thinking to make it out of the East Village gutter during her brief early 80s career. At times a leopard-printed turn-around-bright-eyes Bonnie Tyler, her vocalizations dip occasionally into the powder keg of squawky Long Island secretaries but just as often she laces her shuffle with Ann Magnuson, Kylie Minogue, and that other single-named downtown personality and launches into the ether around that great sparkling ball in the sky. Luckily for fans of dance-floor drama and those into the idea of a Cristina comeback, the folks at ZE have reissued her entire output, which includes 1980s sprawling, ultra percussive Doll in the Box and its darker 1984 synth follow-up, Sleep It Off. Self-titled when it was originally released, Doll In the Box was produced by August Darnell aka Kid Creole. The humid ""Jungle Love"" arrangements are clearly his, but the frenetic Latin beats work well with her sensibilities. Obviously intended for the dancefloor, only a 21-second bit of incidental noise dips below four minutes and the majority of the tracks are well above five. For example, ""Don't Be Greedy""'s handclaps and taunting group whines contrast with the smooth vibes, horn section, and Cristina's pouty ruminations that ""every time I mention sex you turn away and say you're out of breath,"" etc. The jazzy percussion's reminiscent of Liquid Liquid: snaps, shakers, cowbell, and maracas. Cristina's especially fun when she vamps: ""Temporarily Yours"", an up-tempo couples-only roller-rink spin cycle finds her asking not to be labeled a whore briefly before she makes like Veruca Salt lusting for that golden goose, breathily demanding ""Give it to me/ Give it to me/ I want it now"" over handclaps, flute, and a woozy string section. She emerges in salsa mode for ""Blame It On Disco"", lamenting the absence of her man, who she fears is dancing his life away. A taut bass and junkyard bongo army tear it down halfway through; later, she moans wantonly over a telephone synth, squeaker toys, and a heady Latin choir. The original album is buttressed with five strong bonus tracks. Besides two versions of her Betty Boop cover of The Beatles ""Drive My Car,"" the creme de la creme offering is the half-spoken cabaret of ""Is That All There Is?"" which focuses on Cristina's father burning down her childhood house and her hard-ass response: ""Is that all there is to a fire?"" The track resembles David Tibet and Gogol Bordello doing the Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack: ""If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep dancing/ Let's break out the booze and have a ball."" As with many of her compositions, she squeals about the NYC club scene of the time of ""bored bankers dancing with beautiful models"" and ""beautiful boys with dyed hair dancing with each other."" Then, of course, she falls in love with the ""most wonderful boy in Manhattan"": ""He'd beat me black and blue and I loved it."" The final coda mixes in a cuckoo clock and broken glass, people talking and laughing panning between speakers, a popped cork, a balloon. Proving this gem wasn't an anomaly, Cristina throwns down plenty of magic on her sophomore release, Sleep It Off. Adorned with a fabulous Jean-Paul Goude photograph of a long-necked Cristina swan as musical staff, the album was produced by Don Was and includes a contribution from James Chance and covers of Van Morrison's ""Blue Money"" and the 1980 country hit ""She Can't Say That Anymore"". Perhaps mirroring the times (the bohemia promise of 1980, the gentrification of 1984) this is a darker album all in all. The subject matter is especially downtown edgy, as if she was dipping into Kathy Acker and Lydia Lunch when she sat down to pen her libretto. Opting for shorter/tighter shorter songs (none reaching five minutes) and more hooks, Cristina sounds especially alive while also bringing to mind a patchwork-punk Debbie Harry with an ultra cool Euro backing band. ""He Dines Out On Death"" presents a suicidal woman with a fistful of pills in a foreign hotel. In the creaky ""What's A Girl To Do"" she sings, ""My life is in a turmoil/ My thighs are black and blue/ My sheets are stained so is my brain/ What's a girl to do?"" All this amid an off-kilter, squawky synthesizer coupled with very tinny toy piano break-up, and slithering distortion. She also offers her first of many Johnny Rotten snarls. (Also check out the Julie-Ruin styling of ""Don't Mutilate My Mink"".) It's on the bonus tracks that she especially shines. ""Smile"" is a Blondie-infused triumph. There are two takes on the ""Deb Behind Bars,"" more stiletto-punk cabaret. ""Things Fall Apart"" transforms a music box into fuzzed death disco w/ electric guitars. Best of all, her chirpy, whiplash cover of Prince's ""When You Were Mine"" (rendered here as ""When You Are Mine"") is an indispensable tablespoon of synth-pop sugar. While these albums are obviously old-school crackly, they don't feel dated or nostalgic. And though the time's past, perhaps a pair of reissues will give at least a glimpse of how complex and fun popular culture could've been if Harvard girl Cristina's intelligent kitsch had lodged itself in the popular conscious instead of the new-age pabulum of a desperately seeking diva with a goddess complex.","Mutant disco label ZE records reissues two downtown '81-era gems from this campy new-wave art-punk.

"Travel Edition, 1990-2004",Saint Etienne,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33dea9e61561daa4c2a/1:1/w_160/682b1bed.gif,2004-12-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6975-travel-edition-1990-2004/,Sub Pop,"Of all the cyclical trends in pop/rock history, mod revivalism is perhaps the most oxymoronic. England's original mods borrowed elements of continental style and danced to western music from black America and Jamaica, filtering it all into something uniquely English. ""Mod"" is, of course, short for modern, but since the first Weller/Quadrophenia-inspired revival of its fashion and music, this has been chiefly forgotten. Not so by Saint Etienne, who-- although they've probably been to a few all-night soul stompers in Italian boots-- have pulled up the kickstand on their lambrettas and rode open-eyed and eared through the past 40 years of music history, making stops in Rio, Paris, Wigan, Kingston, Ibiza, Munich, New York, SoCal, Detroit, and Stockholm along the way. Over the past 15 years, Saint Etienne's music has been the result of the marriage of the best mod traditions of style and sophistication with a restless engagement with the world's best pop sounds. Their albums are like the contents of giant trunks adorned with the stickers from all the places they've visited, unpacked and arranged seamlessly alongside charity shop-purchased souvenirs of London circa 1966 and memories of the city circa 1988. As a result, Saint Etienne have managed to make a career out of the mixing and matching of everything in the past 40 years of rock history except, well, rock'n'roll itself. Their music is a blend of girl group, Motown, Northern soul, disco, yè-yè and other French pop, soft pop/bubblegum, acid house, and Europop, with a few spots left on the dance card for techno, dub, hip-hop, bossanova, and tropicalia. They've also managed to somehow both inhabit and reflect a very familiar, ordinary world and yet somehow make it seem exotic. Cafès, clubs, dialogue from films, the detritus of failed relationships, the bonds shared by lifelong friends: It's everything your life is made up of except everyone they know is younger and better-looking and dressed more sharply than everyone you know, and yet they're still approachable and friendly enough to invite you round their house for vodka and lemonade and play you the b-side on the Frank Wilson or Skatalites or Walker Brothers 45 they found in Spitalfields market last week. What in the hands of many bands can seem like gravedigging or posturing is with Saint Etienne rather singular, and it's no surprise that this slightly conceptual pop band has attracted such a rabid following. And yet Sub Pop's new single-disc compilation, Travel Edition, 1990-2005, isn't for those fans; it's for the people who've avoided Saint Etienne, a task that should have been difficult but, depressingly, has been exceedingly easy. A pop band first and foremost, Saint Etienne are perhaps the blueprint for today's fluxpop-- artists with ultimately pop sensibilites who reach the fringe of success but never crossed over and became mainstream stars (a group that today includes everyone from Annie to Fox n' Wolf to M.I.A.). In the early 90s, Saint Etienne had their share of UK top 40 singles but no honest-to-goodness hits. They butted heads against grunge, in the process kick-starting britpop, and then-- once that devolved into guitars-only, 60s worship-- butted heads against it and the laddism that enveloped it, as well. Being slightly out of step may have allowed them the freedom to do what they wanted but it didn't afford them the popularity enjoyed by most of their contemporaries. Travel Edition does a succinct and frankly fair job of cutting through a career that is difficult for newcomers to approach. With no consensus go-to Saint Etienne album, and a catalog made of distinct and unique parts, it's difficult to drop in on any single moment and feel satisfied that you've gotten the full picture. Personally, my favorite Saint Etienne LP is the difficult-to-find German version of one of their more overlooked records, Tiger Bay. Ask around and you'll be just as likely to hear that-- save the slight stumble of The Sound of Water-- any of their studio records is their career peak. Even more confusingly, they have a number of brilliant tracks hidden away on soundtracks, rarities comps, and fan club-only releases. Travel Edition is surprisingly the group's first U.S. career-spanning compilation and-- although a pale comparison to the now-OOP 1990-95 singles comp Too Young to Die or the two-disc 90s comp Smash the System-- it's still a nicely chosen primer. StS is still easily available, but with the exchange rate the way it is, Sub Pop's abridged edition is a welcome option for could-be U.S. fans. Its first half is all highs, sullied only by the continually baffling decision not to include Britpop blueprint ""London Belongs to Me"" on any Saint Etienne comps and the omission of ""You're in a Bad Way"". The latter is seemingly replaced by its de facto, bouncing-around-London companion piece, So Tough album track ""Mario's Cafè"". All inside jokes and sunny optimism, ""Mario's Cafè"" describes London as a place of lazy pleasures like morning coffee, the Racing Post, the KLF on TV, and the quirks, hopes, and desires of close friends. ""Everyone's dreaming of all they have to live for/ Joking around/ Still digging that sound,"" singer Sarah Cracknell coos. Sometimes losing yourself in London isn't such a bad thing. The rest of the first first half of the disc is sublime: The acid-tinged cover of ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"", the single edit of ""Avenue"", and the tear-stained ballads ""Hobart Paving"" and ""Like a Motorway"" are all nearly flawless. The second half is a little heavy on tracks from Saint Etienne's prescient Swedish pop-tinged Good Humour-- no surprise, considering it was their only full-length studio record to come out on Sub Pop. It also includes the oft-overlooked ""Burnt Out Car"", the two best tracks from the underwhelming Sound of Water, and a pair from the return-to-form Finisterre. The tugs here for longtime fans are the short, early-90s instrumental that acts as the set's overture and a new song which serves as a taster for the band's early 2005 release. Both are excellent. The instrumental, ""Primrose Hill"", is a charming little acoustic strum that hints at the melody to Finisterre's ""Soft Like Me""; the full new track, ""Fascination"", is a continuation of that record's buzzing, whirling melodies and another of Cracknell's wise, detached urban-relationship narratives. The album closes with the title track to Finisterre, which reads like the band's manifesto, almost every line a slogan and a hint at why and how they've become such unifying figures over the past 15 years. The song's title refers to Land's End, the place on the English coast in which the world supposedly ends. When paired with claims that ""I like the feeling of being slightly lost/ To find new places"", ""There are too many bands that at length sound tame"", ""So bored with...the myth of common sense"", and ""I believe in love over cynicism"", as well as Cracknell's chorus call, ""Finisterre/ To tear it down/ And start again"", the song neatly encapsulates the band's longtime realization that pop music's traditional timeline and oft-told tales have reached that mythical land's end; that the well-traveled road that led from from Elvis to the Beatles to punk to Nirvana has run into a dead end, and it's time to go back and traverse some of the more overgrown paths, to tell the stories that have been consigned to footnotes in pop's back pages, to start again. If you've not travelled those roads, this is a good a place to begin as any.","Saint Etienne issue their first U.S.-only, career-spanning compilation, Travel Edition. This Sub Pop release draws from all of the band's studio albums and features two previously unreleased tracks-- a Foxbase Alpha-era instrumental and a newly recorded song.

"Tiger, My Friend",Psapp,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18813d1975652138666/1:1/w_160/9ece0a49.jpg,2004-12-12 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6558-tiger-my-friend/,Leaf,"Just in case you miss any of the auditory clues-- the plucked sting melodies, puerile rubber ducky background squeaks, Galia Durant's lulling syncopated vocals-- Psapp offer verbal clarification that they are, in fact, dream pop: ""Only when I'm sleeping do I see,"" sings Durant on ""Rear Moth"", from the band's new album Tiger, My Friend. But this isn't your ordinary MBV knock-off; the London-based duo fall into a glitchier category, fitting naturally and notably alongside bands like Lali Puna, Ms. John Soda, and a less sentimental Postal Service. While many recent albums in its vein have thrived on maudlin excess (The Postal Service's Give Up, Notwist's Neon Golden) or facile Portishead impersonations (Beth Orton's Daybreaker), Tiger, My Friend is much frillier. Psapp tread lightly, exploring instrumentation and rhythm with a touching, childlike curiosity. Their songs don't bear much weight, musically or lyrically, and that's part of what makes them so appealing. Psapp knock out intricate songs in odd meters with impressive dexterity. Frail strings, trebly pianos, and glockenspiels mingle quietly and expressively beneath Durant's breathy vocals. It's difficult enough to arrange such fickle instruments in straight time, but Psapp tackle daunting rhythmic blueprints without flinching. Most of the time it works. ""Chapter"" and the title track feature cascading polyrhythmic melodies while ""Rear Moth"" stomps out a jaunty 5/4. Of course, with music this purposefully airy, Psapp suffer from a certain amount of preciousness. But even Tiger, My Friend's most saccharine numbers are delivered cautiously. ""Curuncula""-- with its wistful guitar loop, click-clack beat, and faint sustained organ-- strikes the best balance: Durant levels the song's rhythmic pep with her demure vocal delivery and a chorus of, ""We have only ourselves/ Only ourselves to blame."" Though Psapp are sure to draw comparisons to Múm for their use of music box and glockenspiel, the songs on which the twinkling instruments feature most prominently are actually the album's darkest. ""Calm Down"" has a chilly opening hook and whooshing, glacial background textures. The following track, ""Velvet Pong"", with similar instrumentation and an almost identical melody, is sequenced perfectly; Durant stands out during the song's chorus, singing in a hazy, coquettish croon that recalls Cocorosie's Cassidy sisters. Tiger, My Friend is surprisingly coherent for a debut album. Compared to Ben Gibbard's in-your-face emotionality or Ms. John Soda's blissed-out urbanity, Psapp are refreshingly restrained, and the result is greater consistency. Sure, greater dynamic variety and some selective risktaking would be nice, but these precocious upstarts already got the tough part pinned down: subtlety. Psapp have laid themselves a remarkably self-assured template for subsequent outings.","Just in case you miss any of the auditory clues-- the plucked sting melodies, puerile rubber ducky background squeaks, Galia ...

As often happens with electronic producers, the records he releases under his own name tend to showcase his more ""serious"" academic side, jettisoning beats in favor of studied digital soundscapes. As with Piercing Music (1994) and Floating.Point (1997), Signal to Noise comes from Henke's own Imbalance Computer Music imprint, which is now distributed by Kompakt. One of Henke's enduring fascinations is completely digital composition that remains connected to the sounds of nature, and the three tracks on Signal to Noise continue his experiments in this vein. In Henke's sleeve notes, which perhaps give too much away (admitting that his ""recordings mainly consisted of harmonic droning, so I found them to be a bit boring after extensive listening""), he details his working method, which involved pitch shifting and filtering drones from the Yamaha SY77 synthesizer. The neo-moonscape photograph on the cover from Joshua Tree National Park is an appropriate visual analog to these dry and dusty tracks. ""Signal to Noise I"" is 20-plus minutes of morphing static, with an extended chord or two that also undergo gradual filtering. While much drone music gets mileage out of slow changes that exist in the threshold of perception, Henke's filter sweeps are explicit and obvious, such that you can almost see his hands slowing turning the nobs. ""Signal to Noise II"" is more standard ambient territory, with a simple series of held tones, while ""Studies for Thunder"" sews rolling booms, explosive crackles, and cyborg cricket chirps into the digital wind. Henke's prized Yamaha dates from 1990, but his favored textures seem much older. It all sounds a bit like an early synthesizer artifact circa Wendy Carlos' 1972 record Sonic Seasonings, illustrating how filtered white noise assumes the character of wind and rain with the proper tweaks applied. It's completely devoid of drama (quite intentionally, I'm sure), and instead seems to exist to facilitate some sort of meditative state. Too often, though, Henke makes the easy choices, and the predictability of these sounscapes keeps the listener from full immersion.

Volume alone doesn't make for great rock music, and A Cricket in Times Square take a risk on their debut album by ditching precision and almost rendering themselves faceless. They hit the usual reference points-- from the guitar jams of a ""Sister Ray"" to the massive shoegaze of Bailter Space-- so the trick is to set themselves apart from their forebearers. Frontman Michael Tyler often drowns his vocals by shouting into the winds, rendering himself almost anonymous. You can hear his space-weary voice more clearly on the slow numbers. He gets an extended showcase on ""Outliving Your Shadow"", a drowsy slow dance on which he sounds like he's drooling on his pillow; the last half of the song jerks awake with an extended guitar solo that wails and doubles up on itself. But even as the guitars try to crush the album, the band's songwriting triumphs. Each track is a distinct composition, from the climbing riffs of ""Careless"" or the ominous two-note figure that repeats through ""5 1/2-Minute Hallway"", chased by eerie leather-winged-bird noises that recall early Pink Floyd. In the quiet-to-loud Galaxie 500 dreaminess of ""Mourning Son"", the chorus hangs on like a battleship in high seas while the band struggles to bash it off course, and the frenetic melody of ""Everything Known About Medicines"" hits the highest energy mark, setting off eruptions at every chorus. Other effects-heavy guitar bands may be more psychedelic, outro or spastic, but by taking a straighter approach to their wall of sound they play to their strength: the gigantic melodies. The band's pedal fetish doesn't get in the way of songwriting, and each wash of noise yields a memorable tune. It's not clear why they named themselves after a children's book, except that the image of a cricket chirping in the middle of skyscrapers matches the way they sound like they're shouting into a vast expanse. In spite of the static, their message hits the mark.","Leaf Records dream poppers Psapp recall Lali Puna, Ms. John Soda, and The Postal Service.

Tell It to the Dust,Anders Parker,by: Stephen M.

This is not so surprising from the man who fronted both Space Needle and Varnaline-- the former was a spacey rock trio with psychedelic leanings, the latter an earthier counterpart that emphasized alt-country-oriented songs. Tell It to the Dust (which is possibly named for John Fante's Depression-era novel Ask the Dust) follows Varnaline's final bow, 2001's Songs in a Northern Key, and mixes elements of both bands-- especially in the songs that bookend the album. The record opens with its title track, which features the LP's loveliest melody and catchiest chorus-- both of which are sung in service to lyrics that communicate sober resignation: ""I know it's dust to dust/ I know it all will fade/ I know it's built to rust/ and that it all will change."" But the track's straightforward accompaniment turns a corner on the coda, as Parker's guitar wrings the drama out of his everyday observations. What began as personal becomes something immense and ascendant. Its counterpart, the closing ""Doornail (Hat's Off to Buster Keaton)"", works a murky blues riff into a nearly eight-minute jam, but remains grounded and mired in the mud, creating a very different kind of drama as Parker sings about how ""time won't change a thing."" Both songs inhabit the same emotional space, but the musical terrain is strikingly different. The 10 songs between ""Tell It to the Dust"" and ""Doornail"" don't reach the heights of those two, but they do reflect the tension between Parker's restlessness and his need for strictly defined musical structures. Parker lets various instruments define different songs, which not only lends each track its own distinctive personality, but also gives the whole an added dynamic. ""Feel the Same"" fades out on a George Harrison guitar line, and ""Into the Sun"" rides a ponderous guitars riff that threatens psychedelia. Kendall Meade's piano and Joan Wasser's violin make ""Innocents"" sound even more fragile, and kudos to Parker for using the words ""sunbeam"" and ""moonbeam"" unironically. If any song on Tell It to the Dust could have fallen flat, it's this one, which is a warble away from Counting Crows/Five for Fighting schmaltz. Yet in the context of these hard-luck songs (especially followed by the reassurances of ""Don't Worry Honey, Everything's Gonna Be Alright""), it succeeds as a tender ode to childhood and a lament over the hardships of adulthood. Despite his warring urges for both making and breaking form, Parker doesn't reinvent or even update the nearly dormant alt-country genre, but he does gently nudge it: Tell It to the Dust tweaks his sound just enough to make it sound not ambitious or innovative, but deeply personal, like something only he-- and not Space Needle, Varnaline, or anyone else-- could have recorded.","Former Space Needle and Varnaline singer Anders Parker issues his first solo album under his own name.

"Working for the Man: The Best of the Island Years, 1992-99",Tindersticks,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7be13d19756521394ba/1:1/w_160/d2c838e0.gif,2004-12-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8075-working-for-the-man-the-best-of-the-island-years-1992-99/,Interscope,"The early catalog of the always under-appreciated Tindersticks has recently been getting the royal spa treatment in the UK, with each of their first five albums receiving a full re-mastering overhaul, complete with oodles of added bonus tracks and rarities. While the title Working for the Man: The Island Years might imply a more comprehensive retrospective, what we have here is instead something of a sampler platter covering the years 1992-1999, and intended to whet our appetites for the day these lavish reissues finally see domestic release. One of the most brilliant and idiosyncratic (and now longest-lived) bands to emerge from Britain in the early 90s, the Tindersticks' timing was such that they quickly found themselves caught up in the wash of music press hype and Britpop bluster, and as an unfortunate result it seems their early records are far more often discussed than actually heard. Nevertheless, I don't think it's too outlandish to suggest that their luxuriant, melancholic orchestrations have exerted some degree of influence on acts such as Crooked Fingers, The Black Heart Procession, and Belle and Sebastian. With their blankets of violin and keyboard organized cozily around Stuart Staples' weathered baritone, some critics have suggested that Tindersticks simply comprise the lite version of Leonard Cohen or Nick Cave's literate romanticism. In fact, I was put off the group for a brief time after my mother mentioned that she enjoyed them because Staples' voice reminded her of easy-listening giant Roger Whittaker. (Although, who knows-- with his songbird whistling and pipe-tobacco warmth-- perhaps Whittaker is overdue for a Burt Bacharach-style career reappraisal.) But the uniformly excellent songs collected on Working for the Man amply illustrate that Tindersticks possess the inventiveness and compositional muscle to be considered the peers of bands like the Bad Seeds rather than mere imitators. Though the group has yet to release a bad record, most of Tindersticks' best ideas can be traced back to one of their first two albums (confusingly both are self-titled), so it's not surprising that each are well represented on this 11-song collection. Included here are such highlights as the galloping spaghetti western twang of ""Her"", the archetypal ""Tiny Tears"", which once served as a backdrop while a bathrobe-clad Tony Soprano gobbled Prozac, and ""Traveling Light"", Staples' debonair duet with The Walkabouts' Carla Torgerson. The main quibble about this set is its brevity-- for a band renowned for its expansive grandeur, a mere 11 tracks feels awfully skimpy. The tremendous Island-era album Curtains is only represented by one lonesome track, while the group's 1996 soundtrack for the film Nenette et Boni is ignored entirely. Early pressings of Working for the Man include a second disc of B-sides and rarities that greatly enhances the collection's appeal. Though several of these rare songs prove to be pleasant but unremarkable piffle, this disc does contain crucial tracks like the group's impeccable covers of Pavement's ""Here"" (which arguably trumps the original Slanted and Enchanted version) and Townes Van Zandt's ""Kathleen"". Reportedly these tracks will not be included as extras on any other of the album reissues, so if you want 'em, you'd better hop to. And if you've waited until now to get your first glimpse of Tindersticks' verdant landscapes, Working for the Man may just be the porthole you've been seeking.","The early catalog of the always under-appreciated Tindersticks has recently been getting the royal spa treatment in the UK, with ...

Stones Throw 101,Various Artists,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f1ea9e61561daa56e0/1:1/w_160/d318d7e5.jpg,2004-12-09 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2004-stones-throw-101/,Stones Throw,"God Bless Peanut Butter Wolf, Egon, and Stones Throw Records. No, seriously. Tear your ceremonial American Apparel sackcloth, dirty with your salon-tussled hair with sacrificial ashes, and thank Jehovah for almost a decade of Stones Throw goodness. I mean, who else would release a comp of late 1970s/early 1980s Connecticut hip-hop? Since PB Wolf (aka Chris Manak) dropped his opening salvo with then-deceased best friend Charizma in 1996, Stones Throw has been hip-hop's avatar, preserving all the merriness of a South Bronx block party and the dedication of a sleepy-eyed cratedigger. Since then, Stones Throw has burgeoned into funk reissue kingpins and the home of some of the finest, most original hip-hop on either coast. To christen their 100th release-- a limited edition white vinyl EP-- PB Wolf and his decks birthed a 42-track mixtape covering the breadth of the label's work. Needless to say, covering a label's entire collection is difficult-- especially considering the Stones Throw roster epitomizes idiosyncrasy. But Wolf's track selection is impeccable as he knits a seamless mix from a truly colorful yarn. (Besides, you can't go wrong when Madlib produces 70% of the tracks.) Charizma appropriately opens the retrospective with an Oliver Twist intro, an allusion to ST's dusty beginnings: ""In the b-boy stance, I'm in the smog all alone/ When I didn't have a mic, I rapped with headphones."" From there, ST 101 turns ""SportsCenter"": all highlights. From Yesterday's New Quintet's sonorous, lighthearted ""Young Girl"" to J. Rocc's cavernous breaks on ""Play This One"", PB Wolf dances through the ST catatlog, including a handful of oft-forgotten tracks from his funk subsidiary, Now-Again Records. Couldn't get enough of Hoagy Carmichael's fuzzy arrangements for Boston jazzmen Stark Reality? Lost your copy of Constitution State producer Dooley-O's 1990 12"" ""Watch My Moves""? Just can't bring yourself to buy from a group called Funkaho? The gang's all here. And, of course, the unreleased and material is on-point. Jaylib's foggy ""Blaze Up"" introduces a J. Dilla cum Max Headroom, swimming in a vocoded abyss. Meanwhile, on Madvillian's ""Figaro"", Doom's braggadocio marries the Bollywood cuisine of Madlib's mysterious Beat #222. If the mix CD doesn't clearly illustrate the Stones Throw sound, the accompanying DVD fills any gaps. From Madvillain's dazzling Stan Lee cartoon free-for-all on ""All Caps"" to the choreographed breakin' and poppin' on Breakestra's fiery ""Getcho Soul Together"", the videos provide a free-spirited alternative to music video's status quo. Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf's ""Red Light, Green Light"" is a hilariously dated collage of home video and live performance with the duo's head-bobbing antics from 1993. Jaylib's burlesque ""McNasty Filth"" is the only commercial fare but, don't worry, the girls ""volunteered"" to be in the video. (Way to be, kids.) The bonus features are the weakest part of the collection. While amateur video of Egon interviewing Lester Abrams of the obscure Omaha funk octet L.A. Carnival may hold personal value for the ST staff, the segment comes off like an inside joke. Moreover, the footage of Jaylib's first performance in London is poor and far too short. It's nice to see Dooley-O rock the mic again, but most of the bonus section seems unnecessary. Fortunately, the rest of the set is nearly flawless.","God Bless Peanut Butter Wolf, Egon, and Stones Throw Records. No, seriously. Tear your ceremonial American Apparel sackcloth, dirty with ...

Tales Told,Ian Broudie,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47313d1975652138cf1/1:1/w_160/ae677586.jpg,2004-12-09 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1142-tales-told/,Deltasonic,"It's long been axiomatic that actors want to direct, journalists wish they were novelists, and rock critics end up fronting bands like Yo La Tengo (just biding my time, man). Therefore, it's not surprising when a gifted producer tries to take a star turn on the other side of the boards. But for every College Dropout, there are a thousand dust-covered copies of Mitchell Froom's Dopamine or Daniel Lanois's Shine. Former Lightning Seeds singer Ian Broudie's first release under his own name, Tales Told, is destined to languish alongside the latter releases-- though not before its scattered moments of pop pellucidity spark some second thoughts. This former producer for Echo and The Bunnymen as well as The Fall has never confined himself to the production desk. In fact, Broudie got his break playing guitar for Big in Japan, whose other members later joined The Slits, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Best known for his shimmering synth-pop as the primary (and often sole) member of The Lightning Seeds, Broudie has taken a requisite turn toward the meditative on his first full-length since 1999's Tilt. Gentle guitars replace bouncy Casio tones, and Broudie is more likely to whisper words of regret than recite unabashedly over-the-top lyrics like ""love is the truth, I realize,"" from the Seeds' exquisite 1989 hit ""Pure"" (a clear precursor to The Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights"", in all its sappy glory). Lead single ""Song for No One"" best bridges the gap between the Seeds' infectious optimism and the new album's quiet despondency. ""I'll kiss the world with fingers crossed,"" Broudie sings over sprightly acoustic arpeggios and shaken percussion befitting The Guild League. He always had the clear, uncertain voice of an innocent, and age has only slightly rumpled its edges. At times the zaniness of Broudie's recent knob-twiddling work for fellow Liverpudlians The Coral and The Zutons seeps in, most regrettably during the closing vamp that disrupts the bright, Zombies-esque songcraft of ""Got No Plans"". Instrumental ""Super Cinema"", which opens with screeching violins and a ""Hit the Road Jack"" bassline, dances naked to the same hodgepodge 1960s rhythm as The Coral's best singles. But vaguely psychedelic lullabies like ""He Sails Tonight"" are more in line with ""Simon Diamond"" (or a glossy revamp of Pink Floyd's ""Green Is the Colour"") than, say, ""Zuton Fever"". Title track ""Tales Told"" echoes the plodding guitar, stately orchestration and, you know, title of ""Telling Tales"", from 1994 Seeds effort Jollification. ""The time for telling tales is gone,"" Broudie observes. Instead, one presumes from the repeated lyric at the end of closer ""Something Street""-- ""that's how I feel""-- Broudie is telling his heart. If that's the case, then he's acquitted himself admirably, but the tales were better. Tales Told lacks the charm of the Seeds' most ebullient singles, and it's certainly no Crocodiles, either. But buck up, Mr. Broudie. I mean, Tim Robbins directed Cradle Will Rock, which was pretty good, but he starred in The Player, which was better, and fuck if The Shawshank Redemption isn't on cable somewhere right now. Me? I'm still holding out for a more lucrative record deal.","Respected producer and former Lightning Seeds singer Ian Broudie issues his first solo album since 1999.

Bush Meat,Infinite Livez,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a05e6ef959693229e8/1:1/w_160/53bd5587.jpg,2004-12-09 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4157-bush-meat/,Big Dada,"So you're an armchair Anglophile but you're burnt out on your old Britpop records, which by now seem so humdrum that even your word processor's spellchecker recognizes that genre name. UK garage has fallen into disrepair, as has two-step (or were they the same thing?). Your own middle-American town is already clogged with more British Invasion revival bands and post-punk facsimiles than you know what to do with. You're still not exactly clear on what ""grime"" is. But you know you like The Streets. You're feeling Dizzee Rascal. Alas, you've played the available quartet of Dizzee and Streets LPs to the point of depletion. There's tons of Brithop to be found by filesharing, but if you're the old-fashioned sort who prefers label sanctioned releases, the pickings on this side of the Atlantic are slim. Roots Manuva? Fine, but you're looking for some next shit. You feel a profound empathy for fans of Argentine literature, ""all three books of it,"" as Guy Davenport caustically remarked in a recent Harper's article. You sink into a slough of despair. But then you stumble across Bush Meat by Infinite Livez. You can tell by the cover-- a bunch of Space Invaders-ish creatures menacing a sweating, Cyclopean hand puppet-- that something funny is going on. Since about a fourth of the track names include ""feat. so-and-so"", you glean that it's a hip-hop record. What's more, there are certain indications-- song titles like ""UKKrap"", a sans-full-stop ""Mrs"" (you've read Eats, Shoots & Leaves, natch)-- that maybe it's a British hip-hop record. And it is! Infinite Livez is Bethnal Green-based MC Steven Henry, a member of the Shadowless Crew, and his alter ego...or collaborator...or publicity stunt...or whatever, Barry Convex, the aforementioned one-eyed puppet. Henry's style recalls London expatriate Slick Rick with its vibrant, merrily obscene storytelling and velvety flow. On ""The Adventures of the Lactating Man"", a first-person narrator laments his newfound freakhood. It's leavened with clever wordplay-- eventually, the lactating man floods the streets of London, ""Everybody staying afloat in boats, 'cause I made it rise with breast milk, way (past your eyes / pasteurize)""-- and plenty of lurid trickling sounds. Or check out ""Pononee Girl"", which seems to be a pretty straightforward account of picking up a My Little Pony in a bar. The seduction hilariously unfolds over a bombastic bass track laced with suggestive whinnies. Over dense, bouncy beats that teem with cartoon and video game sound effects, Henry's rhymes are cadenced and musical, and will be more palatable than Mike Skinner's to those of you who dig the accent, but can't countenance his stilted anti-flow. Henry exhibits a broad range and natural sense of showmanship, his voice smoothly tripping between a plosive singsong and an intense growl. Bush Meat also salutes concept album masters De La Soul, with seamlessly sequenced skits that are inseparable from the imagined landscape of the songs. ""Claati Bros"", a slyly satirical metaphor about selling art made of elephant dung, is book ended by skits that take place at an art show, where aristocrats with Oxonian accents gush over the scatological sculptures by ""Infinite Livez, a young black artist from the gay-to."" Others, like ""The Forest Spirit Sings the Bush Meat Song"", abandon hip-hop entirely in favor of cerebral, digitally mangled post-music soundscapes. At this stage, when the playing field for British hip-hop in America is so small, it still seems useful to weigh Infinite Livez against the genre's stateside pacesetter, The Streets. While Mike Skinner's music focuses on the mundane, Steven Henry's zeros in on outsized, lowbrow absurdity (he claims Andre Breton and Robert Crumb as influences), embracing rap's more slapstick qualities. But as more British MCs make their way to American shores, Streets comparisons will fall by the wayside. As Pitchfork's own Tom Breihan rightly noted in his review of the Lethal B posse cut, ""Forward Riddim"", ""There are hundreds of MCs running around East London, and they're hungry."" We'll see the genre shed its novelty status in the American mind and take on the sort of full-bodied variegation that Infinite Livez embodies in a single LP. That's something to look forward to.","The sadly underappreciated Tindersticks have their 90s output squeezed into an 11-track compilation.

HAMTA\xCF!! Allëhlüïa! Allëhlüïa! Allëhlüïa! Dear, dear earthlings. You never realized what awaited you from beyond the skies. You lived here, with your war and death, and wouldn't take good advice from a higher species. Worst of all, you have imprisoned the innocent ambassadors from the planet Kobaïa, who only came to teach you their peaceful, technologically advanced ways. Why did you do this? Didn't you realize that the Kobaïans would send help, in the form of the Ultimate Weapon? Of course, you had let the Kobaïans go, and were it not for the one guy on your planet with any sense-- the prophet Nebehr Gudahtt-- you would've surely failed to grasp the Kobaïan creed of self purification and communication with the Supreme Being. I mean, that's the reason you entered the Time of Hatred (Theusz Hamtaahk) and that whole Dead Earth (Wurdah Itah) thing. Come on, even you, adolescent beings of the universe, can understand that. Well, for the few of you still unaware, there is Magma. Magma-- don't worry, they're not aliens, just French-- play ""zeuhl"" (pronounced ""tsoil""), which means ""heavenly music"" in the Kobaïan language, and lucky for you, detail the whole shabang. Led by drummer/vocalist Christian Vander, Magma began playing this stuff in the late 60s, and throughout the 70s produced a series of records that are either some of the most bizarre, fiery prog ever, or just instant party killers. First of all, they sing everything in Kobaïan, which means ix-nay on the araoke-kay; second of all, zeuhl sounds like, well, about what you'd expect an alien rock opera to sound like: massed, chanted choral motifs, martial, repetitive percussion, sudden bursts of explosive improv and just as unexpected lapses into eerie, minimalist trance-rock. Vander actually came from a jazz background, and is a major Coltrane fanatic, so it's not hard to see why he'd be so into intense, spiritu-cosmic concerns. But even still, Magma are pretty out of left field. K.A is a nugget of wisdom revived from a different era. During the early 70s, in between such classic works as Mekanik Destruktïw Kommandöh and Köhntarkösz, Vander composed a piece entitled ""Kohntark Anteria"" that he never got a chance to record. Parts of it showed up in later albums, but like Brian Wilson's Smile, it lay dormant until the time was right. And that time, young pilgrims of love, is now. Believers will be delighted to know that the band's first studio album in twenty years retains all of their power; K.A features everything we already love about Magma and then some. Newcomers: now is your time to jump onboard the train. As Zebëhn Straïn De Geustaah might say, ""Kobaïa Is de Hundin."" Würd. Of course, it's not actually required that you follow the interplanetary libretto to dig Magma, which becomes very good news over the course of K.A three epic-length tracks. Titled simply ""I"", ""II"", and ""III"", they're joined together to form a single, monolithic slab of sound that really only has parallel in modern-day zeuhl disciples Ruins (whose self-invented language suspiciously resembles Vander's Kobaïan), and by proxy, the so-called brutal prog bands (Flying Luttenbachers, Hella, Orthrelm, Cheval de Frise, et al.). However, Magma are much less brutal, opting for more subtle, jazz-inflected dynamics: the churning, spiraling patterns of vocals, keyboards and drums in the last movement, the impressionistic choral harmonies in the second and fluid counterpoint of the opening section. Magma are often compared to really old-schoolers like Richard Wagner and Igor Stravinsky because of their aggressive, often dissonant performances of deceptively complex music. Vander's melodies seem simple-- modal and repetitive-- but the lines weave in and around each other in a dizzying fashion. What's more, no matter how often they threaten to resolve into something calm and final, Magma are restless and hyper to a fault. The final movement moves through over twenty minutes of propulsive, whiplash drumming, lengthy (and, frankly, a bit meandering) soloing, and even relatively straightforward choral melodicism, so that when it arrives at its climax of a hundred proclamations of ""hallelujah!"" (or ""allëhlüïa!""), I'm just about out of breath. Vander pushes the band harder and harder, and they ride out the last four minutes of the piece in continuous, orgasmic frenzy. In fact, another core aspect of Magma's sound is their almost religious-experience intensity. (Some people actually accused them of promoting fascism in the 70s, such was the unified, juggernaut front they presented in concert.) K.A is a monster, and as good an intro to this band as any. I'm only too happy to spread the gospel.","The famed French/Kobaïan proggers offer three epic-length tracks of ""heavenly music.""

For one thing, she's responsible for one of the best acoustic guitar strums of 2004-- the simple notes that usher in ""Stray Paper"", the opening cut off her new album Tambourine. They're everything they should be and nothing more: thick, melodic and in service to the singer. And when coupled with the track's lyrics, the song suggests a stately Neil Young, but with Merritt's composed, gorgeous voice rather than a world-weary falsetto. Already recognized for her heralded 2002 debut, Bramble Rose, Merritt is still languishing in pop purgatory, but Tambourine has all the makings of a smash. Recorded by George Drakoulias (who helmed albums for The Black Crowes and The Jayhwaks) and with session musicians instead of Merritt's backing band, the album dresses simple, solid Americana in glamorous, well-cut attire, swerving clear of prevalent mainstream gags such as goofy humor, crystalline production, and schmaltzy narratives. Instead, Merritt veers toward a more soulful sound: Tracks like ""Ain't Looking Closely"" and ""Wait It Out"" are classic backporch power pop, while ""Late Night Pilgrim"" sounds like Wilco had they hunkered down and refined their country licks instead of branching out into more experimental territory. And while these songs don't offer much variety, the buoyant, well-balanced instrumentation makes Tambourine a breezy listen. Emerging singer/songwriters face a tough task: Establishing a distinct personality through subtle qualities in voice. Merritt is still working on her image-- for now, she's more likely to be described in terms of her forebears than in laudatory descriptors-- but on ""Good Hearted Man"" she gives her best shot. If the track's horn refrain sonuds familiar, that's because it swipes the opening notes from ""Pomp and Circumstance"". Fortunately, the high school graduation standard provides a fluffy foundation for Merritt to lay down her wishes and avowals. The song-- with its sprightly upbeat guitar hits, tinselly horns, and crooned backup vocals-- reveals an affection for Motown and classic American soul, a refreshing homage coming from a country singer. Merritt's lyrics are sentimental and unspectacular but her sanguine voice infuses otherwise run-of-the-mill verses about finding a suitable bedfellow with fresh blood. And that's pretty much the norm for Tambourine. Who needs fancy words when an effortless turn of inflection can speak volumes? Merritt has a long way to go before she runs the risk of being mistaken for A-league stars like Emmylou Harris and Dusty Springfield. But that we can speculate about her one day achieving that status is itself a tremendous compliment.","Why isn't Tift Merritt famous?

Not that this is a bad thing-- Patterson should take pride in being able to both crunch numbers (as in the gear-shifting ""Honest to God"") and perform simple math (such as the spacious noodling introducing ""Loose Lipped Error"") with such violent grace. Charmer takes little time to get up to speed. The introductory track, ""An Insomniac's Complexion"", opens with three quick hits, pauses for a moment atop a bed of squealing feedback, and then begins thrashing. The group can squeeze five minutes' worth of song into 120 seconds (""A Passing Glance""), stretch their hyper kinetic pummeling out to comfortably fit a six-minute frame (""Amphetamine Praise""), and switch seamlessly between pensive throbbing and full-on fury without breaking stride. (Take your pick from any of the 11 tracks; I'll stand behind the aforementioned opener.) Though the sturm and drang the group regularly summons doesn't fail to impress, the quieter moments sprinkled sparingly throughout-- the guitar/trumpet duet that introduces ""As Far as Goodbyes Go"", the two minutes of relative quiet at the start of ""Loose Lipped Error"" slowly ratcheting the level of tension, and the scream at the end of the CD that morphs into what sounds like a sped-up bagpipe track digitally castrated-- might be more impressive. It's easy to just hit the one note and hold it; it takes skill and confidence to try different tacts, and it's a whole different proposition to try these sorts of changes at the speeds Breather Resist achieve. And, lest we forget, while the band grinds their way through these taut catharses, there's vocalist Steven Sindoni riding the wave and doing his best to splay his vocal chords through volume and will. If you can actually make out any words he's screaming, then kudos to you-- it's not as if Sindoni offers any help. The few moments of vocal clarity I found were quickly subsumed and subdued. Granted, in the wake of a glorious racket such as the stuff Breather Resist concoct, it's more important to get across to the listener the unfettered aggression and fury of the music as a whole than to be implicitly understood. Breather Resist send that message out loud and clear. And I do mean loud.","Rising alt-country star bears no relation to Stephin-- though if her career trajectory remains steady, she may soon not require that distinction.

For Those Who Hear Actual Voices,Zane Trow,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8929d034d5c69bf3a9a/1:1/w_160/270d1c78.gif,2004-12-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8279-for-those-who-hear-actual-voices/,Room40,"I got to thinking the other day about how incredibly odd it is that we keep free-roaming animals in our homes, little furry things that go about living their own lives as we go about ours, intersecting with us on the couch or at feeding time. I have two cats, and when I watch them on Sunday or in the evening during the week, it occurs to me that I have no idea what they are thinking or even the nature of their thoughts. We have no direct means of communication and even through our indirect means we can speak only in generalities like ""No!"" or ""Meow"" uttered with eyes fixed on the door that hides the food. I mention this in conjunction with Zane Trow only because the other day when I was playing For Those Who Hear Actual Voices at home, the more vocal of my two cats began to sing along. Not really, of course, but he was mewing and howling as he often does and Trow's frequency modulations were coursing in their aquatic way through the room. The overall effect was as though the cat was somewhere in the recording, like some strange whale lost in Trow's deep sonic abyss. Last week, I was soaking in the album on the train and the sound of the warning that precedes the door to the rail car's closing rose from somewhere within the music. Bum-bum! It's not quite a perfect fourth, but it's close, and it coincided perfectly with the swell of the music-- I think it was track five, ""Louder Sleep"". I spent the rest of the day at work testing out how it sounded at a low volume in my cubicle, mixing with the constant overhead sound of the vents and the chatter of co-workers. Although I couldn't always hear the album that well, looping as it was from the PC speaker under my desk, it would creep into my consciousness just often enough to give the day a profoundly different feeling from the others I've spent in that sterile tower. Pure FM synthesis has strange, unique qualities, and I've loved the sound ever since I first heard some of John Chowning's 1970s experiments with the technology. As academic as most of those recordings were, they still have a haunting beauty and natural logic to them, and that carries over into For Those Who Hear Actual Voices, which exploits similar techniques to beautiful results. The album has a graceful flow and almost supernatural glow that Trow heightens through subtle looping, delay, and laptop mulching. The result is purely electronic music that feels like it could be a thousand years old; it has a permanence and the terrifying clarity of Caribbean shallows, where everything beside you is crystal clear, but the water's density causes objects to appear as if from nowhere in the distance. There are no tired, glitchy beasties coming out of that unknown here, though, and I'm grateful for that. For those familiar with the general aesthetic principles that guide most of the Room40 label's output, this will be yet another piece of nearly perfect ambient, and for the uninitiated, well, imagine what it'd be like to listen to a million shades of blue, and you're getting there.","Zane Trow makes purely electronic music that both sounds as if it has been around for thousands of years and blends perfectly into the noise and clatter of contemporary life.

The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face,Man Man,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5315e6ef95969323a6e/1:1/w_160/9867e6bd.gif,2004-12-08 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5621-the-man-in-a-blue-turban-with-a-face/,Ace Fu,"I have two recurring dreams. The first: my feet are mysteriously attached to a skateboard (Birdhouse deck, Thunder trucks, 55mm Creature wheels) and no matter how hard I try not to, I somehow land every trick-- even the physically impossible ones. The second: I am walking down the Ocean City boardwalk when I see a band of bums napping in cardboard boxes. In the dream, I think to myself, ""Wait a second. A band of bums..."", and suddenly I turn into a bum and convince the other bums to start a band with me. The bums are reluctant. Then there's a fight of some sorts, then there's the kissing, and seconds later I wake up holding my hunting rifle and a copy of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. The skateboarding dream always made sense to me, but the band of bums one I don't know, I just never understood the appeal. Things started to click two years ago. In real life, Philly band Man Man, then performing as Gamelon, would show up for gigs with about 50 people in tow, half of them pushing shopping carts filled with recyclables, the other half carrying musical instruments straight off the Island of Misfit Toys: legless upright pianos, bent horns, clarinets made of human flesh, etc. I imagine that several of these instruments were trash-picked or, at the very least, made from pieces of trash. Man Man played songs that sound like Tom Waits, Captain Beef, and Frank Zappa, but there was something earthier about them, something twisted and gross and grimy (but not that kind of grime). Tom Waits' songs are heavyweight boxing matches we watch on pay-per-view; Man Man's debut, The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face, is an epic street battle between two Vietnam war vets fighting over who gets to sleep on the sewer grate. Brand me with a scarlet R-- ""R"" for Rockist, the target-du-jour of East Coast music-writer McCarthyism-- but I'm struck most of all by Man Man's honesty. Lead singer Honus Honus isn't trying to sound like Waits; he really just can't sing, and the screams and grunts are his best approximations. Man Man doesn't play guitars on these songs either-- not because they're trying to get the CMJ ""New Ideas in Indie Rock"" wheels spinning, and not because they're parodying that Chicks On Speed song-- but because guitars are expensive and bar chords probably bore them. Several Men-Men in Man Man have moustaches. This isn't Vice Party hyper-irony though; this is December in Philadelphia, and their upper lips are cold. Funny thing is, Man Man are spinning wheels. Trade in the six-strings for some trumpets, violins, and preschool choirs, and songs like opener ""Against the Peruvian Monster"" come along: strong melodies play off droopy rhythms, and the screemy-meemy call-and-response exchanges at the end sound scarier than Alien Vs. Predator, maybe even Leprachaun 2. On ""10lb Moustache"", Man Man kitchen-sinks saxophones, marimba bells, animal sounds, and stolen Steinways into a dirty-mouthed theme song for mutiny. ""Zebra"" cops Fiddler's avant-klezmer dog barks and clarinet melodies for Love Gone Wrong, and tops them off with bluesy bitterness: at the end, a freaky chorus sings, ""You stung me bad/ What can I do?/ But leave the stinger in/ So I won't forget you."" ""Gold Teeth"" takes the bright kindergarten melodies of ""Peruvian Monster"" and covers them in Coketown soot. The song could be about anything with lines like ""Her hips are a warm sarcophagus"", but Man Man, for all the song's fingernail dirt, rusty shaves and sleepwalking, still sound really tender. These are songs kids like Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger listened to before crying themselves to sleep. For the second half of Man in a Blue Turban With a Face, Man Man trade up melody for mania. The band touches on Need New Body territory before mustering the album's most focused narratives. The gritty-gorgeous ""I, Manface"" is a first-person Roman tale of a boy raised by wolves, and the similarly involved ""Werewolf (On The Hood Of Yer Heartbreak)"", Man Man's throaty doo-wop closer, goes something like, ""You're a diamond in the rough, baby/ A werewolf on the prowl, come and save me"", but with the charm of say Elvis' ""Don't Be Cruel"", or the Drifters' ""Under the Boardwalk"". Sounds crazy, I know, maybe even impossible. But just remember: under the boardwalk, down by the sea, there are probably bums sleeping, so try not to wake them.","Philadelphia spaz-rock freaks Man Man divide their time between melody and mania, all with a nod or three to Tom Waits and Captain Beefheart.

Tepid Peppermint Wonderland: A Retrospective,The Brian Jonestown Massacre,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a392b1335d7bf1698768/1:1/w_160/9f68e27a.jpg,2004-12-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/929-tepid-peppermint-wonderland-a-retrospective/,Tee Pee,"For almost 15 years, Anton Newcombe and his ever-rotating crew of accomplices in Brian Jonestown Massacre have been conducting a prolonged experiment designed to test the validity of the theory that there's no such thing as bad publicity. Over the better part of their career, the band has been more closely associated with outrageous ego trips, prolific drug use, violent feuding, and bountiful sideburns than with their actual musical output. The focus on the group's extra-curricular activities has been more magnified than ever since the release of Ondi Timoner's Sundance Grand Jury Prize-winning documentary Dig!, which candidly charts the relative career trajectories of the Brian Jonestown Massacre and their glossy nemeses, The Dandy Warhols. Although Newcombe has issued statements on BJM's website and elsewhere denouncing the film's portrayal of him as a tantrum-prone, self-destructive megalomaniac, there can be little doubt that the documentary has also generated an unprecedented level of interest in the band's work. Now, recognizing an opportunity to re-direct the attention of a curious public back onto the band's music, Tee Pee Records strikes with the massive two-disc retrospective, Tepid Peppermint Wonderland. From a distance, Brian Jonestown Massacre's rivalry with the Dandys has always seemed faintly ridiculous, since choosing between these two wildly erratic, frequently mediocre acts is a little like asking your kid which he'd prefer for dinner: a jar of pimentos or a can of water chestnuts? Though BJM can be an enthralling live act if caught on the right night, on record, their purebred Summer of Love psych-rock often suffers in comparison with their 60s formalist peers. They lack the wit and virtuosic scope of The Bevis Frond or Major Stars; the prodigious melodic instincts of The Green Pajamas or the Elephant 6 hordes; and the pure galaxy-flattening mass of Comets on Fire or Acid Mothers Temple. And needless to say, unlike such psych-inclined groups as Ghost, Sunburned Hand of the Man, or Boredoms, BJM have never betrayed any interest in attempting to transcend their influences in order to actually expand on rock's known territories. So where does that leave us for Tepid Peppermint Wonderland? With a full 38 tracks of Brian Jonestown Massacre's patented mid-tempo Between the Buttons-meets-The Notorious Byrd Brothers-meets-Loaded attack to plow through, that's where. The most remarkable thing about this career-spanning collection of older, rare, unreleased, and live tracks is to note how little the band's sound has appreciably changed over the course of their creative lifetime, despite all of the intra-band disharmony, wholesale line-up changes, and general turmoil. This fact is accentuated by the set's non-chronological running order, which places newer songs like 2004's ""If Love is the Drug"" cheek-to-jowl with BJM oldies like ""Wisdom"" or ""Stars"", which Newcombe claims is the first song he ever wrote on guitar. But the group's entire oeuvre is so entirely and uncannily of a piece that it's virtually impossible to date these tracks without checking the liner notes. So while you have to give Newcombe credit for keeping to his musical course regardless of outside trends or stimuli, you're also likely to wish that they could've incorporated more variety into their Tepid onslaught. 1996 was a particularly productive year for the band, and not surprisingly many of this collection's highlights are of that vintage. The three albums they released that year (Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request, Thank God For Mental Illness, and Take It From the Man!) essentially mapped out the boundaries of their sound, as evidenced on this collection by such inclusions as the hazy VU drone of ""Anemone"", the cosmic country jangle of ""It Girl"", and the loose-limbed R&B; shuffle of ""Oh Lord"". How much you'll enjoy any given BJM track depends almost entirely on your fondness for its riff (my personal favorite here is a live version of the Cure-like ""Swallowtail"") because once Newcombe and crew latch onto a couple chords they'll typically ride 'em straight through until sunrise. On epic-length tracks like ""She's Gone"" or the set-closing ""Sue"", their steadfast repetition can quickly cross the thin line separating the hypnotically powerful from the merely tedious. Particularly when you factor in these longer, more monotonous numbers, Tepid Peppermint Wonderland represents a numbingly large dosage (more than two hours worth) of Brian Jonestown Massacre. Significantly more, I daresay, than most listeners are going to require to get the point. Even if you're a newcomer with an appetite this will likely be all the BJM you'll ever need, and if pressed I'd suggest you instead get your hands on a copy of Satanic Majesties' Second and call it a day. Diehards may find joy in some of the previously unreleased nuggets included here, but the rest of us will continue to grow increasingly impatient for the day when the Massacre's musical feats can prove as adventurous as their off-stage exploits.","After nearly 15 years, Anton Newcombe and his ever-rotating crew of accomplises in Brian Jonestown Massacre are finally getting the compilation treatment. This two-disc, 33-track collection strips away the feuds, drug use, mental illness, and rock star aura from these subjects of the recent Sundance-winning documentary Dig!, and focuses, for once, on their music.

Bangzilla,Mix Master Mike,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35dc0084474cd0c345d/1:1/w_160/090337c6.jpg,2004-12-07 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5339-bangzilla/,Immortal,"Listening to most turntablism albums is like putting porn on the TV, turning up the volume really loud and leaving the room to masturbate. The interdependence of sound and vision are such that the spectacle of some character flipping his leg behind his neck while he juggles two records is perfectly reasonable as long as those two records are an old funk 45 and a Godzilla sound effects platter. Not only that, to become the creme de la creme, that same character is not allowed to repeat the feat two shows in a row, lest he dare wedging the panties of a thousand air-scratching credibility auditors. Mix Master Mike is one of the rare breed to dominate every corner of the turntable culture. He's the fanboys' favorite world champion, the old-timers' anointed torchbearer, and the ambassador to the mainstream, as appointed by The Beastie Boys. Yet, despite his credentials, his records are boring. Take the title track, ""Bangzilla"". It's basically a Prodigy demo without that screaming idiot trouncing all over it, supplanted by Cold War samples and Parkinsonian scratching. Now, if you were in a small venue watching the video close-ups of Mix Master's hands twitching like a Thriller zombie all over the place, you could probably cup your hand over your mouth and declare, ""Oh, snap!"" or something. But on record, as far as you know, he put a vibrator on the turntable and went for a sandwich. The rest of the album follows suit. The beats are slabs of gray concrete to be scribbled and tagged over with inexorable displays of wikky-wikked film noir snippets in lieu of any coherent mood or theme. The more impressive bits will raise some eyebrows on first listen, but that's exactly where Mix Master loses out to a fellow cratedigger like DJ Shadow, whose albums are less about technical prowess than impressionist sample layers. While Shadow might not stand up to Mix Master in a battle, he understands that the production album is not a proving ground. Mix Master has little to prove. In Doug Pray's 2001 film, Scratch, Mix Master has a scene where he runs through the basics of scratching in what looks like his mom's basement. It's like watching Lebron James show a fat white dude how to dunk. When Mike's done with the lesson, he rips the proverbial rim off your garage with an improvised assault on his poor little turntables. And then, of course, there are his live shows with the B-Boys where he interpolates whatever the fuck he feels like in the middle of the group's classics, enlivening the Boys' dog and pony show. Inevitably, connoisseurs of the genre will snap up this album like it's a mint copy of ""Skull Snaps"" because it will serve as a mnemonic device for the times they've witnessed Mix Master Mike move a crowd. But for the casual listener, Bangzilla is nothing more than a mechanical curiosity.","Listening to most turntablism albums is like putting porn on the TV, turning up the volume really loud and leaving ...

Happenstance,Boyracer,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a373b1335d7bf1698726/1:1/w_160/5548f208.jpg,2004-12-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/899-happenstance/,Happy Happy Birthday to Me,"The last time I wrote about Boyracer for Pitchfork, I compared frontman Stewart Anderson to Bob Pollard of GBV, which left me feeling kinda icky except that it's true. Both of these guys have gone through stretches of writing more pop songs per year than you'd think anyone would except as a stunt-- you imagine them waking up and writing one while the coffee drips, another before the toast pops, a single in line at the bank, and a couple of B-sides while sitting in traffic. Put Boyracer in a room and point cheap mics in their direction and they'll give you endless happy fast-strumming guitar-pop, stuff that sounds like exuberant English indie children in a garage in 1987. They love The Smiths but they're in love with The Pastels; if the packaging matched the content, the CDs would come wrapped in Scotch tape and loose-leaf. Except that Anderson isn't messing around, and that's what elevates this stuff: Despite the rickety joy, these are good serious pop songs. The ones on Happenstance may not be as consistent as on the band's last LP, To Get a Better Hold You've Got to Loosen Yr Grip-- the first half runs to the mediocre-- but they're more varied, and in a lot of cases more serious, more emotionally affecting. At best they start to pick up on the same charm that used to carry Belle and Sebastian-- real-life recordings of a band in a room, bashing out reckless pop with an unambitious purity that immediately wins you over. Different context, same half-nostalgic postcard allure; more machine-gun drumming and guitar feedback; noisy little notes from here and there. I read a recent complaint that the problem with Boyracer full-lengths is never knowing which tracks to put on your mix-tapes. Pretty spot-on for this collection: All 23 of these songs are about 1:30 long and hard not to like. By my count at least nine are certifiably cool, and unlike that last full-length they run to pop crooning (and pianos!) as much as guitar buzz. ""How Many Cars can You Fit in Your Garage"" sounds like a blooper from a Smiths Peel Session; ""A Chipped Tooth and Greasy Fingers"" has a creaky punkoid quality that'll sound great in cars come summer. ""I Thought Even More of You When You Told Me You Wanted Me Dead"" just looks great on a mix listing, but I'm going with ""On Bleached Gras"", which is simple old-school indie pop of the first order. Which is the thing here: good old English band-in-basement indie pop, totally unnecessary but endlessly charming, ever winning hearts and minds in the cozy apartments of Unrest nostalgists and the suburban bedrooms of Clientele fans. It's all too modest to go telling people they need to hear it-- but if anyone does the hard work of collecting Boyracer's two-minute gems into one 74-minute collection, it'll kill.","The latest LP from this turntabalism star and Beastie Boys pal.

Long Live the Well-Doer,Arbouretum,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1aec0084474cd0bfe7c/1:1/w_160/a90c81c5.jpg,2004-12-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/460-long-live-the-well-doer/,Box Tree,"From Ned Oldham's Box Tree Records imprint comes Arbouretum, a recording project by his brother Will's erstwhile backing guitarist Dave Heumann. Since the Long Live the Well-Doer was created, Arbouretum have developed into a touring band with a full roster; they're recording a group album now. But this record is primarily the work of Heumann and drummer David Bergander, and the skimpy lineup contributes to its clarity of vision and lucid specificity. The record rings with the quiet purity of a pin dropped on tile, locating its force in translucence and strategic omission. Long Live the Well-Doer is rather unusually divided into two distinct songwriting styles-- austere yet richly detailed instrumentals and majestic, lo-fi indie folk anthems. The demarcation is clear: Heumann doesn't allow the two modes to blur together; he deliberately counterpoises one against the other in precarious, hypnotic equilibrium. The most striking antecedent is Dave Pajo's Papa M project, particularly the instrumental/lyrical dichotomy and mirage-like shimmer of Whatever, Mortal. Long Live the Well-Doer immediately sets about conjuring the wilderness it wearily traverses with ""Sands and Sands"", with its intermittent cascades of clattering percussion, the ebb and flow of slithering arpeggios, and distant chimes. On ""I Am a Somnambulist"", a baroque acoustic guitar figure morphs into a ramshackle dirge of shuffling electric guitar and patchwork strings, as if a DJ were crossfading Six Organs of Admittance into Califone. ""Early Bird Gets the Worm"" changes gears, collapsing the other instrumentals' spacious atmospheres into linear articulations of forward momentum, with its clicking drums, rigid wire of guitar, lyrical bass line, and squealing electric leads. The savage blankness of the instrumentals is tempered by vocal tracks that ascend like beacons, their brightness amplified by the murky distances between them. ""Sands Upon Sands"" bleeds into ""Jonas Got a Tooth"", a (smog)gy four-track epic that unveils Heumann's matter-of-fact baritone-- it's a long crescendo described via muted, incremental shifts in intensity and rhythm. ""Don't Let It Show"" is a staticky, coasting lament that seems always on the verge of grinding to a halt-- like melancholic moans drizzling over a plodding folk ballad. And on ""All That Has Come Isn't Gone"", Heumann parades up and down his range, his voice cracking and stretching through crisply enunciated vocal glissandos. Profiting from the tension between these two modes, Long Live the Well-Doer is a startlingly fine (if discomfortingly barren) expanse of windswept aridity, a haunted and piercingly simple desert music limned in stark silhouettes and sepia tones.","This new project from Dave Heumann-- Will Oldham's erstwhile backing guitarist-- is a mix of austere yet richly detailed instrumentals and majestic, lo-fi indie folk anthems.

KA,Excepter,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf9eb335119a49ecd9f/1:1/w_160/ed66706e.jpg,2004-12-07 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2912-ka/,FusetronFusetron,"Chaos theory regards systems, and the idea that any simple one you can think of-- say, the world, or a rock band-- will generate irregular behavior born from decidedly ""regular"" conditions. Textbooks sometimes talk about chaos in terms of fluctuating animal populations, unpredictable weather patterns and ""strange attractors"", but it's everywhere, all the time. And paradoxically, there's order in it. If you put a thousand people on a deserted island, they'll turn into a society. It might seem hard to predict what they'd do for more than a very short period at a time, but if you graph their behavior, they start to look pretty orderly. Computer programs help diagram elaborate formations of tiny spirals that form massive, spiraled fractals to describe, say, the economic tendencies of your new, island society. Chaos is an attractive idea, not just because it often seems to match with daily life experiences intuitively well, but also because it feels like something nature has been trying to tell us all along. For all their unpredictable behaviors, Brooklyn's Excepter has individual parts that are easy enough to see. John Fell Ryan (ex-No Neck Blues Band), Dan Hougland, Macrae Semans, Caitlin Cook, and Calder Martin are-- along with groups like Wolf Eyes, Black Dice, Gang Gang Dance, and Sightings-- the new sound of chaos. They share musical similarities to This Heat, Can, and Faust, in as much as most bands playing ""fractal noise"" (what I would call Excepter's sound; ""fractal"" representing the idea that ordered patterns arise from disorder) are similar to them. However, that's not the same thing as saying those bands necessarily influenced Excepter. Rather, they are all in the continuum of musicians exploring/exploiting chaos in rock. So, yeah. Sounds kind of complicated (or just convoluted), right? It's not, really. From the seemingly limited array of possibilities that should come out of five people playing ""progs"", sampler, synth, and percussion, comes a bizarre artifice, albeit with a beautiful intrinsic logic. Excepter are ""important"" to me for the same reasons I believe they'd be important for anyone into the idea that music can represent culture, in the most general way-- so general, in fact, that it's hard to see unless you step back to look at the patterns. None of this is to say Excepter are trying to be chaotic or noisy; rather, their kind of organization is born from kernels of sound allowed to branch out into (near) infinity, restricted by nothing more than its own feedback-- much like the chaotic behavior of economies or weather. Fusetron's CD issue of KA (originally on vinyl in 2003) includes Excepter's incredible 2004 Vacation EP. It makes a very convincing case that the superficially, peripherally related worlds of electro-acoustic improvisation, IDM, psychedelic rock, and minimalism can not only be joined, but done so in a fashion both natural and ingenious. ""Vacation"" and ""Forget Me"" are particularly so, and comprise some of the most fascinating music I've heard this year. Over a simple, persistent drum-machine pulse, disembodied voices, both male and female reverberate through clouds of synth and echoed timbales. The tonality is decidedly major, but with sharp minor-7ths straight out of Can's ""Quantum Physics"" from Soon Over Babaluma. In fact, if you can imagine that piece slowed down by half, but twice as dense, you're getting close to ""Vacation"". It's impenetrable in the best sense. The rest of KA is less attractive but hardly less interesting. ""Shattered Skull"" features more ghostly voices, but replaces rhythmic pulse with the ebb and flow of a two-note loop and shaken percussion, sounding like blades of dry grass tied together. ""See Your Son"" is similarly mysterious but spookier, eventually converging on a chorus of voices in no particular harmony except during random, brief consonant asides. ""Be Beyond Me"" brings the drum machine back, though the feel of the track is turbulent where ""Vacation"" had been sublime. The track fades out in a drone, attaching a subtle synth pattern to the bass drum pulse in a way thousands of minimal techno tracks have, but never approaching watercolor bliss; rather, it's an imperfect model of repetition and mood. The one-minute ""Breast of the Wave Offering"" obscures the pulse by muffling the entire production and drenching it with bass drone and what sounds like homemade electronic squeaks. It segues into the wild ""The Fire and the Wood"", behaving like the unhinged cousin of Black Dice's Creature Comforts, digital animal kingdom and all. The untidy patterns are everywhere and chaos abounds.","One year after its vinyl release, Excepter's KA is issued digitally, with their excellent 2004 EP Vacation now included.

An Anthology of Noise & Electronic Music / Third A-Chronology 1952-2004,Various Artists,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82ab1335d7bf1699205/1:1/w_160/a9d54617.gif,2004-12-07 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11711-an-anthology-of-noise-electronic-musicthird-a-chronology-1952-2004/,Sub Rosa,"Guy-Marc Hinant's Anthology series is best taken as a primer on obscure artists who spent countless and often thankless hours and nerves in basements, laboratories, and studios struggling to translate cold electricity into actual music. His civil service is noble; too many greats were shoved to the side in many textbooks and ""hip, urban tastemaker"" namedrops that typically praise the graces of Cage, Stockhausen, Russolo, etc. Hinant was also guilty of sacrificing a few goats to these deities in his first Anthology. However, Hinant took his second volume into greener hinterlands. He featured the likes of BBC sound designer Daphne Oram and David Lynch collaborator/Eraserhead soundtrack mastermind Alan R. Splet, and he ended this set of noise and electronic music with a Captain Beefheart spoken-word performance. Hinant actually apologizes for the shortcomings of his third volume, which focuses on Germany's electronica heritage. His survey introduces a few laudable drone and musique concrete artists, but gives little sense about the German electronic aesthetic. The faces of Kraftwerk, Oval, Mouse on Mars, and even Der Pate Stockhausen are missing. The great krautrock legacy is reduced to Neu's Michael Rother drifting to sleep on the Autobahn with Jaki Liebezeit playing with his seatbelt in ""Feuerland"", and a tiny excerpt of The Faust Tapes that shall fly over heads. German post-techno doesn't get much justice either: Carsten Nicolai's ""time...dot (3)"" will remind one of the ""clicks and cuts"" backlash, and Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg donates a decent but monotonous recording of a chugging engine he recorded when 16. For the non-Germanic material, Hinant offers an often enticing survey of alien and hallucinatory soundscapes. Japanese warlord Merzbow will singe memories with ""Birds and Warhorse"". Masami Akita first discomforts with peaceful birdsongs heard through a hazy cell phone-- causing me to flinch as I anticipated a thermonuclear blast of feedback at any moment. And, by gar, the bastid delivers. The birds wail like mistaken SARS carriers on their way to a government biohazard disposal-- the monolithic distortion and digital hardcore beats drive the death march. Michel Chion also bites the neck with ""Requiem: Dies Irae"", a ballet of bathtub operas, whispered group chants, and theatrical death threats.

The rest of Anthology dwells in kitchen-sink collages and white noise indulgence best left to term-paper footnotes. The closer, ""Eternal Love #3""-- by Swedish minimalist techno unit Phauss, along with composer CM von Hausswolff and filmmaker Erik Pauser-- fails to seek transcendence with Geiger counter clicks and lawnmower guitar hums.

In/Out,Limblifter,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd8abf31b7dc715603b/1:1/w_160/3524b46d.jpg,2004-12-06 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4974-inout/,MapleLimblifter,"It has been four years since Ryan Dahle released new material with Limblifter; in that time, his band has undergone some major personnel changes. Most notably, his brother, drummer and co-founder Kurt Dahle, left in 2001 to join the star-studded Vancouver pop juggernaut New Pornographers. The Dahle brothers also worked together in the 90s pop group Age of Electric, so the disintegration of their longtime partnership could have presaged a noticeable shift in quality and content. But while In/Out is an uneven Limblifter release, its strongest moments suggest that neither the extended recording absence nor Dahle's departure has impeded the band. Which isn't to say that Kurt's absence is entirely inconspicuous. The album's most glaring flaw is Burento Follett's weaker, more anonymous drumming, which follows his predecessor's simple, effective pop style but lacks a necessary propulsive energy. Many of these songs were initially crafted around drum loops, and the technique shows-- Dahle opts for a mechanical, nondescript rhythm section to back his more interesting vocal melodies and arrangements. Opener ""Get Money"" is the first of three forays into MOR rock radio fare, but it's redeemed by Dahle's knack for melody and compositional variation-- which is highlighted by an interesting post-punk section. ""Perfect Day to Disappear"" suffers from a blander, more repetitive approach, and ""Fiercely Co-Dependent"" adds little to the formula established by the previous tracks, coasting on a standard-issue circular guitar riff. Though I/O is frontloaded with potential singles, Dahle's most interesting material appears in the album's latter half. ""Drug Induced"" layers a hazy guitar line over a Supertramp Wurlitzer foundation, veiling Dahle's bizarrely graphic lyrical imagery-- it's hard to imagine any context in which the line ""I'm gonna stop whoring from endorphins to the orphans of abortion"" wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb, but its concealment almost subliminally strengthens the track. ""Alarm Bells"" makes excellent use of understated string accompaniment, and the comparably gritty, garage-oriented ""On the Moon"" almost breaks though the sterility of the album's otherwise spotless production. The album's weakest moments-- such as the awkward free-association rocker ""Jumbo Jet Headache""-- aren't dealbreakers, but Limblifter would benefit from the diversity that has characterized Kurt's work with New Pornographers. Limblifter too often rely on rigid, conventional pop structures designed to accentuate Dahle's inventive melodies, sacrificing the complexity hinted at in the album's strongest tracks. As a comeback from an extended hiatus, I/O re-establishes Limblifter as a skilled pop ensemble, but the band hasn't quite reclaimed the kind of energy and spontaneity that has defined their best work.","It has been four years since Ryan Dahle released new material with Limblifter; in that time, his band has undergone ...

The Floating Glass Key in the Sky,Rainstick Orchestra,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a310c0084474cd0c01be/1:1/w_160/3baf0652.jpg,2004-12-06 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6933-the-floating-glass-key-in-the-sky/,Ninja Tune,"Many North Americans have spent time knocking about Western Europe or South America; fewer have ventured into the remote enclaves of Eastern Europe, and fewer still to Japan. No wonder the latter has been so extensively mythologized in America's books, films, and music. In the Western mind, Japan is often a trope for mystery and otherness, and two contrary images of it exist simultaneously, like a double exposure: A samurai scheduling his honorable suicide in a Palm Pilot. One can observe our collective vision of Japan evolving, as rapidly as the culture itself, from one of historical fantasy to one of futuristic wonder. It's the Japan of Lost in Translation-- a garish, hyper-accelerated land of rampant technological advance and debased tradition-- that's dominant today. Ninja Tune tends to be good at picking out international acts that avoid caricature, and Japanese duo Rainstick Orchestra's debut eschews the Western vision of Japan as a pinball machine full of lab rats. They also don't cleave to the imagined Japan of old, which occurs to us as a blur of cherry blossoms and hedge gardens, scented with vaguely detected aromas of honor, humility, feudalism, solicitousness, and quietude. Since America is so fascinated by Japanese culture, it's no surprise that the Japanese are intrigued by the U.S.'s as well, and Rainstick Orchestra's polite, placid debut evinces no overt connection to its creators' native country. Instead, it assimilates Western fragments-- the minimalist, avant-garde compositions of Reich and Cage; the breezy demeanor of AM Gold pop and smooth jazz; chill-out techno and laid-back funk; liquid glitchcore; maybe a little Sam Prekop or Archer Prewitt-- into a glassy, frictionless surface of meditative geniality. The duo's electronically sequenced clouds of guitar, bass, piano, and synthetic sound effects have an airy, fluid quality that echoes in both their moniker and the album's, although ""Muzak for Glass Elevator"" would have been equally apposite. The Floating Glass Key in the Sky takes its sweet time-- its seven tracks are longish, five to 10 minutes each, and develop in casually relentless inflections of detail and subtly shifting layers of repetition. ""Trick"" burbles and emotes with varied melodic percussion, fluttering piano, and expressive shadings of sliding bass tones. ""Waltz for a Little Bird"" is a romantically melancholic shuffle snatched from a 70s sitcom theme, all jaunty arpeggios and twinkling xylophone. ""Kiteletu"", besides the lively flute figure that peppers it, is less clear in its melodic intention, building itself from a swirl of sonorous rhythm that collapses into the piano dirge of its middle section. ""Electric Counterpoint Fast"" finds Rainstick Orchestra reworking Steve Reich's collaboration with guitarist Pat Metheny into an imbricate cascade of digital tones and whispery trills, and the ethereal keys of album ender ""Closed Circuit"" ebb and flow over a metronomic hi-hat. The Floating Glass Key in the Sky understatedly demonstrates how technical complexity can achieve pristinely simple results when melody is given priority over esotericism.","The first Limblifter LP in four years is also the first since the band's co-founder Kurt Dahle left to join New Pornographers.

Our Hopes and Dreams,The Owls,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2913d197565213b005/1:1/w_160/bbb77ed0.gif,2004-12-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6074-our-hopes-and-dreams/,Magic Marker,"Emotions take up space. They are not merely psychological but physical, and, as any tongue-tied 7th-grader knows, they have weight. Music is how they breathe-- through clenched teeth or a lover's soft exhale. The Owls' debut ""mini LP,"" Our Hopes and Dreams, gracefully explores the vacuum left behind when they escape, like helium from a popped balloon afloat somewhere between Sarah Records and Past Masters Volume Two. Opening track ""Air"" provides the pin. After an incantatory verse and skidding bass fill, multi-instrumentalist Maria May introduces the disc's koan-like vision with a deceptively simple couplet: ""There is only air/ Where I used to care."" A few tracks later she will be ""looking down over everything"" but for now, her breathy vocals are just beginning to flutter in the breeze, held aloft by acoustic guitars, piano, scattershot drums and-- nope, I don't even inhale-- a heavenly duet with The Legendary Jim Ruiz Group's Allison LaBonne. Plus, unlike that Ben Folds song a few years back, this ""Air"" doesn't even have painful associations with Godzilla. LaBonne's compositions hold up admirably alongside the more immediately arresting opener. Her ""Do Ya?"" has much in common with the irrepressible ""Air"" -- its deliberate pacing, oft-repeated chorus, and whispery harmonies -- but the capricious lyrics (""I think I might blow your poor house down"") flesh out May's minimalism with greater humanity. ""Drop Me a Line"" provides a darker, wind-swept sequel to the dizzy high and bare acoustic guitars of May's ""From Far Away"". LaBonne's voice drips with desolation: ""Drop me a line when you get there, far away/ I know you may never get there/ But you'll stay."" Unfortunately, she also proffers the disc's most insipid track, the daintily sing-songy ""Baby Boy"". This tune's goofy back-and-forth is a powerful argument against piano lessons. The Owls' most famous member, relatively speaking, is bassist Brian Tighes, frontman for Minneapolis power-pop mainstays The Hang Ups. He also happens to be LaBonne's husband. Tighes' lone songwriting contribution here, ""Forever Changing"", picks up where the classic 60s pop influences on The Hang Ups' self-titled 2003 release left off, with mellotron, instrumental passages that evince the ""sitting in an English garden"" bit of ""I Am the Walrus"", and the occasional handclaps. The title nod to Love is apt. Clocking in at nearly 25 minutes, the eight-song disc closes with ""Even Now"", written by drummer and fellow Hang Up Stephen Ittner, who has since left the band. With a shushing sibilance straight out of ""Come Together"" and a guitar solo befitting that single's double a-side, he tears out where he used to care and plugs it with bitter resignation-- smiling and melodic all the while. ""I will never change my mind,"" he insists. An ephemeral record that wafts gently in the clouds somewhere damn near the Platonic indie pop ideal returns to Earth at last like a lovesick comet on his final, raucous word: ""Yeah!""","This eight-track, 25-minute ""mini LP"" explores the space between Sarah Records and mid-period Beatles.

Nicky Siano's The Gallery,Various Artists,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e8ea9e61561daa56ca/1:1/w_160/b8ca8937.jpg,2004-12-06 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1994-nicky-sianos-the-gallery/,Soul Jazz,"Since being 'rediscovered' in an Internet chatroom in the late 1990s, New York DJ Nicky Siano has reaped the benefits of this decade's renewed interest in disco. One of DJing's founding fathers, Siano has recently made print and television appearances as well as a return to the live circuit; now we have Nicky Siano's The Gallery, a Soul Jazz-sponsored collection of early favorites from the legendary New York nightclub. Although the word ""disco"" features prominently on the cover, Gallery more accurately is proto-disco or, better yet, primordial-disco. Spanning soul, funk, gospel, and rock, its 17 tracks are united more by a bustling energy than a faithfulness to any one genre. It's not a disco history lesson, but a testament to how exciting and new those exploratory mid-70s sets must have felt. From the inlay photos of Siano and a young Larry Levan decorating the venue with balloons to the charmingly unfinessed way that these different tracks run into each other, Gallery succeeds at communicating the thrill of being in on something from the beginning. It also smolders, something you might not expect from a collection of album cuts and b-sides. Featuring a perfectly executed build, a 13-armed drum break, a narcoticized bass solo, a complete instrumental meltdown and a goosebump-inducing outro, The Isley Brothers' ""Get Into Something"" folds about 12 individually wonderful moments into its seven-and-a-half minutes. Just as tremendous is The Pointer Sisters' rendition of Allen Toussaint's ""Yes We Can Can"", which starts by coasting on a brittle, midtempo rhythm then explodes over the course of its six minutes into a loose, jubilant call-and-response. The remaining tracks can basically be divided into two sections: the soul/funk cuts that map out as disco's direct precursors (Loleata Holloway's ""We're Getting Stronger"") and Siano's more esoteric, far-out selections. With its clickety percussion, whistles, and brittle acoustic guitars, Exuma's ""Exuma - The Obeah Man"" triangulates African folk, Tropicalia, and American roots; elsewhere, the arms-up gospel of Gloria Spencer's ""I Got It"" and the swirling keyboard rock of Bonnie Bramlett's ""Crazy 'Bout My Baby"" hammer home just how wide Siano's umbrella must have been. Anyone who's ever seen a grade-A crate digger fall on his face can tell you that the best DJs aren't the most knowledgable ones, they're the most generous ones. And if The Gallery is anything to go by, Siano-- even 20 years removed from his glory days-- still manages to be both.","Soul Jazz pays tribute to the pioneering DJ and his legendary club with this compilation of primordial-disco, a 17-track record panning soul, funk, gospel, and rock.

Bee Thousand: The Director's Cut,Guided by Voices,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfc9abf31b7dc715636e/1:1/w_160/1fa64655.gif,2004-12-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3600-bee-thousand-the-directors-cut/,Scat,"Our Pollard, who art in Dayton, hallowed be thy name... man, look at that rating. The eighth deadly sin must surely be the curse of objectivity. By now, having been lucky enough to spill my guts all over this site on such diverse topics as the ghosts of GBVs past, present, and future, the myth of Robert Pollard, and a religious experience at a long-gone concert when it seemed like the band might just be the answer to any question rock 'n' roll wanted to ask, it may seem that my objectivity is in short supply. It is. The part of me that holds an irrational, almost baseless devotion to Robert Pollard's hissed-out anthems is screaming ""10!"" from the back of my brain, and it only takes a listen to the restless ghosts of ""The Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory"", or the rejuvenated arena dinosaurs of ""Buzzards and Dreadful Crows"" to weaken my resolve. But something's wrong, and every time that voice speaks up and asserts this album's perfection, it's shouted down by a simple, immutable truth: ""If it's right, you can tell."" Guided By Voices got it right back in 1994. Bee Thousand is the band's definitive moment, the point when the ringing Who-isms of Pollard's youth-- filtered through four-tracks and his own post-punk, X-Men, stream-of-consciousness quirks-- finally matured beyond the atonal growing pains of Vampire on Titus and Propeller. The distinction was slight but unmistakable-- like learning to harness all the jaw-dropping, stadium-quaking power of Propeller's triumphant exclamation (""I'm much greater than you think!"") without all the run-up or refining the unworked defiance of ""Exit Flagger"". On Bee Thousand, GBV mastered all those fragments of greatness and assembled an entire album from them. Sure, it stumbles occasionally, and falters as only four spare-time, blue-collar bandmates from Dayton, Ohio can-- that is, humanly and forgivably-- but the original Bee Thousand simply stands alongside the greatest of the modern era. The original warrants a 10. So what of The Director's Cut? Shouldn't this just be a bionic Bee Thousand? In what parody of a just universe is this not every ounce of the original plus whatever else was left over? I feel faint... Track sequence, it turns out, is really, really important. This new, expanded version of the record includes an early, 33-track sequence. It's spread out over four vinyl sides, along with another record containing the standard B1000 tracks that weren't initially included, as well as The Grand Hour and I Am a Scientist EPs. Unfortunately, this original sequence is so bafflingly unsatisfying that it might've kept Guided by Voices in the basement for another decade had clearer heads not eventually prevailed. ""I Am a Scientist"" first earned GBV a measure of notoriety and in some small way helped legitimize the rise of lo-fi to minor prominence in the early 90s; sadly, it wouldn't even have been included on Bee Thousand (here, it's relegated to the extras and outtakes disc). And that's least of the original's tracklist problems: The ""new"" material in the early sequence is composed almost entirely of Suitcase and King Shit and the Golden Boys tracks-- material that was substandard even on those collections of outtakes. The burden is only slightly ameliorated by an older, thinner version of the otherwise classically bombastic concert staple ""Postal Blowfish"" (better reprised on the Brain Candy soundtrack), a four-track demo of ""It's Like Soul Man"", and a few lazy, acoustic charmers like ""Indian Was a Angel"" or ""Supermarket the Moon"". But for every new highlight, there's an equally inaccessible ""Deathtrot and Warlock Riding a Rooster"" or ""Zoning the Planet""; the resultant load proves to be a little too heavy for even classics like ""Echoes Myron"" to completely bear. With the remains of the final cut haphazardly tacked on at the end, in addition to a thoroughly mixed bag like The Grand Hour, and almost-redundant alternates of both ""Shocker in Gloomtown"" (included twice in the span of four tracks, and yet still valuable for the energy infusion it provides both times) and ""I Am a Scientist"", the ""bonus record"" is as slapdash as The Director's Cut itself. Thankfully, a fantastic unreleased version of ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"" ends this ordeal on perhaps its highest note, dispensing with the haunting atmospherics found on the Alien Lanes version and plunging into a sea of churning guitar and a clipped, punchy vocal performance from Pollard. Of course, a phenomenal finish isn't quite enough to correct the confusing missteps of the previous hour. Despite containing the core of one of the most stunning, unexpectedly triumphant records ever recorded, and a few wonderful tracks besides, Bee Thousand: The Director's Cut manages the almost impossible feat of reducing itself to a merely good album with some incredible highlights-- maddeningly similar to almost every other album our beloved Fading Captain has ever tossed off. The slipshod nature of this expanded reissue serves only to prove two things: for better or worse, GBV is ever Robert Pollard's child (and thankfully Tobin Sprout was around to shepherd it, at least for a time), and that the final edit of Bee Thousand is every bit the miracle it sounds.","Guided By Voices' classic record gets a makeover on this vinyl-only release. The new album includes the original 33-track sequence for Bee Thousand, another record's-worth of tracks that weren't initially included but eventually made their way onto the LP, and The Grand Hour and I Am a Scientist EPs.

Palimpsest,Yasunao ToneFlorian Hecker,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a890ea9e61561daa5856/1:1/w_160/75100714.gif,2004-12-05 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8277-palimpsest-with-hecker/,Mego,"Imagine a poem that cannot be written, read, or spoken by humans. The piece can only be heard-- it can mean everything or absolutely nothing. No words or anything recognizable as human language is sounded. Only machines can create and recite the poem. It can be absolute liberation or total repression. Fluxus veteran and avant-garde maverick Yasunao Tone took an anthology of 8th century Japanese poems and attempted to find their hidden meanings. His product has the qualities mentioned above. Tone scanned the Chinese characters on the Man'yoshu prints through a computer and played back the audible verses-- mining the raw data of sounds heard beneath the text. The words are completely lost. The result sounds like a video arcade heard through tinnitus-damaged ears, as his 2003 eponymous album attests. Yet, such mechanized art still retains a human touch-- the loose handwritings keep a loose rhythm in the chaos. The music is also very slapstick for stumbling across the digital static and misinformation, just like the glitches heard when Tone famously battered CDs for his 1997 landmark piece, Solo For Wounded CD. One memory to take to your grave could be five minutes of that performance-- the twittering and skittering of CD players gasping for air is pure malevolence. On Palimpsest, Austrian laptop-noisenik Florian Hecker mutates Tone's ""Man'Yo"" pieces to decent results. He doesn't remix as much as magnifies every bit of data by 10,000x, uncovering microorganisms that dwell in the poem's fibers and ink. In the exhaustive and sometimes aimless 28-minute title track, he finds two voices in the noise, and divides them to each stereo channel; one muttering to itself while the other panics. Hecker's touch is familiar as his scrapes, pings, and crashes of white noise all flicker about like lawn gnats or a copy of Pac Man for the Atari 2600 dipped in Coca-Cola acid. He still keeps his funk, recalling his unforgettable ""BSF(0)Tyk 5"", where he had a Culture Club studio musician fall dead on his keytar. The rest of Palimpsest are various revisions of Tone's other ""Man'Yo"" excavations. They're mostly homogenous and bring little to the table. ""Man'Yo #3A~37 / 750A54 Zero Crossings [extended mix II]"" opens with what resembles the steel-drum roll of 50 Cent's ""P.I.M.P."" Hecker then adds free jazz-style interplay between the arguing voices, where one moment features a quick pause and then a scream for dear life. His five-minute edit is slightly superior for its brevity that keeps the most memorable moments in line. Closer ""4"" simply time-stretches a roto-router buzz that hovers like a ghetto bird searching an empty weed patch. It's quite poetic, actually.",,6.6,
Underfed,Plush,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b6b1335d7bf16980a0/1:1/w_160/88d73fec.jpg,2004-12-05 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6358-underfed/,Sea Note,"After listening to the pleasant but hardly earth-shattering pop of Underfed, one would never guess what a Great White Whale these songs have constituted for Liam Hayes. For the better part of the past decade, Hayes has kept busy re-working this material intended for his Plush LP Fed. In his attempts to force the music to meet his exacting and ambitious standards, Hayes has allowed the production to flounder somewhere alongside Chinese Democracy, the Loveless sequel, and Waterworld in the pantheon of seemingly doomed creative projects. As it now stands the album's backstory is arguably more interesting than the music itself. In the mid-90s, the lushly orchestrated Fed was conceived to be Plush's debut LP. But after early full-band sessions bore no fruit, Hayes instead released the solo piano album More You Becomes You under the Plush name in 1998; he resumed his work on Fed the following year. As time passed and recording costs began to mount, Drag City backed away from the project, leaving Hayes to reportedly spend more than $100,000 of his own money to pay for a steady succession of studios, engineers, and guest musicians. In 2002, Hayes was finally satisfied enough to allow Fed's release but so far the album has only seen issue in Japan. So now Drag City's Sea Note imprint presents Underfed, a so-called official bootleg version of Fed. Recorded in summer 1999 under the vigilant eyes of Steve Albini and Bob Weston, this early draft of the album features the same songs in the same order as they appear on Fed, but here they are stripped bare of the elaborate arrangements and layers of overdubs that buried them on the final mix. And it must be said (though it probably makes Hayes' pocketbook ache just to think about) that most of the songs sound just as good if not better in this more skeletal format. Perhaps Underfed will ultimately stand as a reminder that an excess of in-studio tinkering is just as like to spoil a well-written song as it is to perfect it. Even without the extra pounds of strings and horns, the songs here are still quite reasonably fleshed out. (There are certainly many more lo-fi records in Drag City's back catalog.) Accompanying Hayes' vocals, guitars, and various organs are drummer Liam Murphy and Isotope 217 bassist Matt Lux. At his best, Hayes effortlessly recalls singer-songwriters like Harry Nilsson and Todd Rundgren, and throughout Underfed he performs with an amiable, we'll-fix-that-later laxity that allows excellent tracks like the opening ""Whose Blues"" or ""Greyhound Bus Station"" to swing more freely than their brassier Fed counterparts. Even by the time of these recordings, however, turgid numbers like ""So Blind"" and ""What'll We Do?"" seem to carry the scars of their difficult birth-- Hayes' vocals sound sullen and distracted, as though he's already beginning to lose his inspiration in the material. If you've gotten your hands on an imported copy of Fed, it can be fun (well, diverting) to go through and do a track-by-track comparison with these earlier versions. And though you'll notice that ""Sound of San Francisco"" eventually gained a lovely little Abbey Road-like intro, and the stuttering funk of ""I've Changed My Number"" is undoubtedly enhanced by the full-horn treatment, it's also interesting to note how little Hayes altered the basic structures of the songs when he added extra coats of glossy instrumentation. This seems to be an implicit acknowledgement that whatever virtues these songs might possess were already well in place by 1999. Hayes reportedly has plans to return yet again to these songs for another round of remixing before he tries to finally get a completed version of Fed released domestically. Personally, I think he'd be better off burning all the masters, sowing the ground with salt, and walking away with a copy of Underfed as his only souvenir from this whole crazy affair.","Fluxus veteran and avant-garde maverick Yasunao Tone teams with Tim Hecker to reinterpret 8th century Japanese poems.

Nights of Forgotten Films,The Strange,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6955e6ef95969320d94/1:1/w_160/aedb8a8f.gif,2004-12-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7795-nights-of-forgotten-films/,Dancing Bear,"In an era of mashups and rampant genre cross-fertilization, I suppose a collaboration between the founder of The Walkabouts-- one of the greatest and most prolific American Gothic bands of the past two decades-- and a Croatian surf-rock band with the nerve to call themselves The Bambi Molesters should come as no surprise. What is perhaps more unexpected, is that this collaboration is a resounding success. Then again, The Walkabouts' Chris Eckman's whispery rasp (which is similar to The Auteurs' Luke Haines) and the copious echo and tremolo of prime surf aren't that far removed from each other-- Johnny Cash and old trucker songs are good precedents. When The Molesters lower the lights and inject a hint of blues and jazz noir into their sound, it's a perfect match. The Croatian band's music is already spectacularly stormy and dramatic, and Eckman had previously delivered an arresting spoken performance on ""Ice & Pinewood Trees"", from The Molesters' excellent second album Sonic Bullets, so there was some collaborative comfort between the two parties. Anyone who thinks of surf as expressly sunny music will have their mind changed by this record. The dual guitars of Dalibor Pavicic and Dinko Tomljanovic are dripping in cavernous spring reverb, but Hrvoje Zaborac's roomy, understated drums and Lada Furlan Zaborac's slinking bass keep them rooted on dry land, free to roam every deep old-growth forest and poorly lit alleyway they can find. Occasional piano, organ, and trumpet darken the edges, and Eckman is the deadpan centerpiece, breathily narrating the blackness of the night with a delivery perched in the gray area between spoken storytelling and melody. He goes the furthest in the latter direction on ""These Lies"", a beautiful, mostly acoustic piece of jazz-inflected folk that somehow combines the feel of a campfire in the woods and the pools of light on an empty city street. Elsewhere, guitars swirl in stately rings around Eckman, and it's quite clear that this is an equal partnership. The Molesters are never relegated to backing band status-- Pavicic dances with Eckman in a melodic call-and-response on ""Tonight, I Will Say Anything"" and then trades off with Tomljanovic's Spaghetti Western rattle in the spaces between verses. ""Tonight, I will say anything/ Any stupid, fucked-up thing/ Anything that helps,"" sings Eckman in a moment of desperation, a slight sneer rising at the corner of his lips. At his most intense, he whispers his lines with utter malevolence, like Jarvis Cocker on ""I Spy"", and his frantic take on Echo & the Bunnymen's ""Villier's Terrace"" is thrilling. ""See It In the Dark"" is the kind of frightening waltz a SoCal Tindersticks might dream up, with lyrics about intra-marital homicide and a two-pronged guitar attack that hits with tangled leads in the high end and grinding, swaying chords in the low. Nights of Forgotten Films doesn't even feel like a collaboration-- the dynamic interactions between the players seems natural and consistently bracing. I already thought The Bambi Molesters were the best surf band in the world today, but it turns out that they're far, far more than just that, able to sublimate their thrashier tendencies in the service of a vocalist. Perhaps where this album succeeds is that there's nothing forced-- each party involved gets to play to its strengths and they effortlessly complement each other. So give credit to Eckman and his Croatian crew: Nights of Forgotten Films is everything a collaboration should be.","American gothic meets Croatian surf on this collaboration between The Walkabouts' Chris Eckman and The Bambi Molesters.

While this has sometimes led to a concern with slight variation in search of novelty or what some describe as ""fussiness,"" artists like Triola's Jörg Burger work in a completely electronic realm yet focus on typically musical concerns such as rhythm, melody, and development rather than the latest processing tweaks. Burger has been at the center of the fertile Cologne music scene since the early 90s, recording under aliases such as The Modernist and Bionaut in addition to a number of collaborations. While Burger released a lot of interesting tracks in a decade that saw electronic music go in a million different directions, he returns consistently to his straightforward and affecting sound-- the bright synth pads, gentle rhythms, and dubby production flourishes of early ambient house. Im Funftonraum is Burger's first album as Triola, after releasing a number of tracks under the name on Kompakt's revered Pop Ambient compilations. While those one-offs were excursions in beatless ambient, the tracks on Im Funftonraum have a relaxed-but-steady pulse of electronic percussion, suggesting chilled-out pop instrumentals. Anyone who knows Burger/Ink's Las Vegas, his collaboration with Wolfgang Voigt, will recognize the sound and construction on display here. The return to those sounds-- Las Vegas was recorded 10 years ago-- hints at Burger's disinterest in fashion. ""Leuchtturm"" opens the album on a note of gauzy bliss, serving perhaps as a lead-in from the fuzzy dronescapes of Pop Ambient. The next track, ""Neuland"", lays out the ground rules for Im Funftonraum, with a cheery whistle of synth, a bouncy keyboard line, and plenty of space for the light to shine through. ""Unland"" adds just a hint of menace, with an echoing sample of buzzing guitar string laid atop the sort of nourish bassline Jan Hammer liked to work into the background of ""Miami Vice"". ""Traumsch\x9An"" is a bit tougher than the rest, with a punchy electro bass and another couple dozen extra bpms to contend with, but the bulk of Im Funftonraum is placid, tuneful, and understated. With 10 tracks motoring by in under 50 minutes, everything about the album seems controlled and precise. Burger has no need for reinvention or paradigm shifts; to him, creating excellent music is all that matters.","Jörg Burger says viva Las Vegas by unveiling the first album from his pop ambient guise, Triola.

Street's Disciple,Nas,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a25e6ef9596932388f/1:1/w_160/10ec4869.jpg,2004-12-05 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5711-streets-disciple/,Columbia,"I'm as big a fan of tableau vivant as the next, but what the fuck is going on with the cover of Street's Disciple? The Last Supper?! Nas is a prophet, check, but the Jesus Christ of hip-hop? Then there's that poor sonuvabitch in the white. Didn't he read The DaVinci Code? Doesn't he know he's standing in for Mary Magdalene, a prostitute? Does he not understand how stupid he looks wearing a crucifix to The Last Supper?! This may be the most unintentionally hilarious ""intentionally hilarious"" album cover I have ever seen. Nas practically needed two discs to back this sort of shit up, which is perhaps one reason why Street's Disciple does the dirty double, with the first disc (purportedly) for the street, and the second one (purportedly) for the home. Sounds gimmicky-- and yes, it's ""sprawling,"" ""massive,"" ""has lots of filler,"" ""should have been one disc,"" etc.-- but guess what: It's cocksure and it works. Relatively speaking, Nas is an old guy now. He doesn't rob banks; he has babies and marries Kelis. He doesn't narrate ghetto life in the glorious present; he reminisces and takes stabs at reform. He no longer needs to prove himself; he just has to flow. Throughout Street's Disciple, Nas simply sounds confident, which is the key to pulling off tracks so thematically un-gangsta: When your best-known lyric is ""I never sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death,"" it can be tough to sell a line like, ""It was my night to watch my little girl."" ""This ain't no sucka for love shit/ This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hugs shit/ First night we fuck shit and don't call the next day,"" says Nas on ""Getting Married"". In Nas' hands, the institution becomes an avatar of badassness, much like faith becomes-- to faith's chagrin-- a vehicle for bravado on the Barry White-sampling ""Nazareth Savage"" (""I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen""), or as education advocacy oddly becomes the new thug ideal on ""War"" (""Tell my daughter try her hardest so the best schools'll take her in""). Nas hasn't mellowed on the mic; he just has different priorities-- and impressively, he doesn't eschew the present for the sake of his dated guns-drawn Queensbridge persona. ""Live Now"" most powerfully sums up Nas' street-tough-to-hubby transformation. Here, Nas describes his death-- not by bullets and rap romanticism, but by old age: ""My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me... Trying to say something/ The whole room'll quiet down just to hear my last words."" Yet, in the same song, as if to counterbalance that tenderness, he anxiously rehashes his past: ""Admit I did live it a little bit/ Sweet pickle dick, freaks licked on it/ Lips I dripped on it/ Sex I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits."" The rhyme feels forced, but maybe pointedly so. Nas realizes hip-hop doesn't like the sissy, and he's careful to balance such personal affairs with the requisite bravado. Nas obviously has no trouble here, and for the most part, Chucky Thompson, Salaam Remi, and L.E.S. front the boards hard and hookless, keeping the focus on the lyrics. Check ""Nazareth Savage"" (""I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the pus, get it?""), the token girls-I-fucked track ""Remember the Times"" (""Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick/ Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement""), or the previously released ""Thief's Theme"" (""Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd/ Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth""). The content is the same as before, but the vantage point is a rocking chair: Nas presents his past as been-there-done-that, an abridged backstory included as a contrast to his present affairs, and perhaps as a concession to some listeners: ""I had to make a song, speakin' on my old life/ For the thieves who come out at night."" The streets are paved with rags-to-riches rappers, but few of them keep the dirt on their shoulder after MTV and the first cool mill. If the Nas of Illmatic was fighting to get Nas out of the ghetto, the Nas of Street's Disciple is fighting to get the ghetto out of the ghetto. The Q-Tip-produced ""American Way"" is politically untimely but fiery, with Nas bemoaning the black vote's impotence, and at one point calling Condoleeza Rice a ""coon Uncle Tom fool."" On the equally vicious ""These Are Our Heroes"", Nas sarcastically salutes ""the coons on UPN9 and WB/ Who 'Yes, master' on TV,"" and calls out Tiger Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., and ""Mr. Goody Two-Shoes"" Jay-Z for selfishness: ""What you doin' for the hood?"" The carps aren't novel-- as Nas points out, ""It's trendy to be the conscious MC/ But next year, who knows what we'll see?""-- but carry unusual weight from the Queensbridge darling. Street's Disciple shares in the missteps we can expect from both double-disc sets and Nas albums in general (a fair number of shitty beats, and the occasional bomb like ""I'm the disciple of music!""), but there's a compelling record in here somewhere, and that album is easily Nas' best in years. For the past decade, he's tried to prove he can thug with the best; now unconcerned, he's caught a fresh breath. Street's Disciple is flawed, but Nas' second wave of confidence is one of the most exciting things to happen to hip-hop this year.","Considering Nas' one-hot-album-every-10-year average, he's due for another great record. The sprawling, two-disc Street's Disciple isn't it, but it's a step in the right direction, as well in a new direction: If the Nas of Illmatic was trying to get out of the ghetto, the Nas of Street's Disciple is trying to get the ghetto out of the ghetto-- and find a decent babysitter.

A Sectioned Beam,Lansing-Dreiden,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcc5e6ef95969323136/1:1/w_160/ec9aef85.gif,2004-12-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4965-a-sectioned-beam/,Kemado,"New York art collective Lansing-Dreiden's focus is notoriously scattered; the group's music is created as part of an ongoing multimedia project. This deliberate jack-of-all-trades approach invites indulgence, and could easily be seen as a diversionary tactic to compensate for lackluster material. Case in point: L-D's A Sectioned Beam EP, the follow-up to The Incomplete Triangle, is being presented as both an album and a multimedia video art project-- but the group overextends itself at the expense of its music, which has arguably never sounded thinner or less cohesive. Opener ""Locks in Shadows"" is the EP's strongest track-- competent 60s sunshine pop similar to Saturday Looks Good to Me-- but still fails to be engaging; the song is a fleeting glimpse at one of the band's many costumes. ""Spectrum of Vapor"" is a droning, heroin-spiked pop number embellished with woozy synths and hushed sitar but it meanders, settling for relatively uninteresting druggy ambience over structure. The title track evinces another sonic diversion, this time into downbeat Madchester territory with touches of atmospheric dream pop. The song doubles as a soundtrack to the group's video project-- which consists of stark, picturesque scenes of plant life digitally mirrored to a vaguely hypnotic, kaleidoscopic effect-- but isn't remarkable on its own. An untitled track is similarly modest; the group's warmed-over Depeche Mode posturing is yet another deliberate and seemingly random image transformation. But again, the music feels primarily conceptual, and in practice fails to expand or challenge a conventional pop formula. For a group with such lofty artistic aspirations, L-D's A Sectioned Beam feels largely tossed off and half-hearted. The long-running debate about the band's sincerity and artistic intent is a non-issue here, as the final product is undistinguished enough to make larger questions immaterial. L-D may theoretically challenge the traditional boundaries of pop music but in this case, mediocre material overshadows any greater collective vision. L-D's image and style is deliberately all over the map, but without strong songs the band's malleability and experimentation doesn't make for satisfying pop-- like the accompanying video, the music on A Sectioned Beam is all smoke and mirrors, occasionally pretty but largely forgettable.","New York art collective Lansing-Dreiden's focus is notoriously scattered; the group's music is created as part of an ...

The Young Machines Remixed,Her Space Holiday,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0b6eb335119a49ed438/1:1/w_160/a1d5b8fe.jpg,2004-12-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3827-the-young-machines-remixed/,Mush,"It was tempting to write off this remix project as another example of strobe lights, Dolby-amplified gunfire, and smoke machines being used to disguise an otherwise meek poet onstage with an awkward haircut. However, three reinterpretations of songs from Marc Bianchi (Her Space Holiday)'s dream-pop/chamber-hop joint, The Young Machines, garner a new appreciation of the wounded bard who sleeps under his bed. Matmos revises our man's violin handiwork on ""Tech Romance"" as a lost Appalachian-folk tune, where a tinker-toy xylophone leads a ballad of weary guitars and syrup-leaking strings. Bianchi rambles like a stranger digging through your trash for soda cans at 2 a.m. in Nobody's vinyl-hissing dub treatment of ""From South Carolina"". And then Stereolab cruelly create a sitcom punch line for Bianchi's ""Girl Problem"". The band first plays peachy keen surf-rock crescendos as he sings, ""Here is the point where I fall apart/ For the second time."" Then comes the ""Munsters""-esque shindig, where he pouts, ""I've got a girl problem/ I've got a drug problem!"" But everything is resolved by a Burt Bacharach clone on the electronic ivories as our hero exhales, ""And I will always think of you as someone that I love."" Bianchi generally writes bad poetry that's harvested from genuine feeling, as Oscar Wilde might have called it. He definitely earned his stripes, as so many critics awarded Bianchi's testicular chutzpah for speaking his soul. Yet the remixers mainly focus more on enhancing his runny-nosed but admirable synth instrumentation than bringing his lyrics to the fore. Not everything clicks: Dntel frolics on a beach in sunset to Easy Listening schmaltz as Bianchi gives a VD clinic lecture on ""Japanese Gum"". Most surprising is Blockhead's fingerprints on ""Meet the Pressure"". There, Bianchi originally whined about critics who dissed his music: ""Don't get me wrong I don't mind getting bad reviews...But there are others who just love to cross that line/ Hoping that their viciousness will boost traffic on their site."" Blockhead had the nerve to reduce those cries into an instrumental theme for a Mexican soap opera-- complete with taunting flutes, flamenco guitars, and senoritas sighing. A more appropriate treatment is the Super Furry Animals' trip to Perrey-Kingsley country on ""Sleepy California"". It's a royal choice when Bianchi announces, ""I never thought I'd say this, but I miss my mom."" Elsewhere, Arab Strap imagines the post-breakup dirge ""Something To Do With My Hands"" as a new wave disco number for a mid-80's teen dramedy. Boom Bip marinates ""The Luxury of Loneliness"" with electro-funk dribbling and hypnotic guitar murmuring-- letting fresh air into the hermit's black-walled bedroom. However, Bianchi's motivational speech still hurts, as he whispers, ""I think that the worst part of it all is that you don't know how beautiful you are/ That isn't all right.""","- Lansing-Dreiden: A Sectioned Beam EP

The Way I Were,Freedy Johnston,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba1eeb335119a49ec958/1:1/w_160/65d6bab9.jpg,2004-12-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4289-the-way-i-were/,Bar/None,"Like a scrawny kid who learns to outsmart the playground bullies, Freedy Johnston has had to overcome his off-putting voice-- high, nasal, and with a tendency to overenunciate-- with tremendous songwriting and storylines whose power derive from their graceful understatement. His songs draw listeners in despite his rough vocals, which he describes in the liner notes to The Way I Were, his new collection of early demos, as ""singing, bleating, whinging, and reed-like croaks."" But like Bob Dylan's, Johnston's voice, unpolished as it is, ultimately becomes part of the attraction: It gives his music an edge of actuality so that the songs seem to belong not to the province of studios and small-club tours, but to the real world of his listeners. This contrast between crafted songs and strained vocals is what made Can You Fly? and This Perfect World, his two most well-known albums, so remarkable and made the tragically underrated Never Home jumpy and raw. But as Johnston's voice either matured or was smoothed over in a crossover attempt-- as on his most recent albums, Blue Days Black Nights and Right Between the Promises-- an essential component of the equation was lost. So it's reassuring that Johnston has at this point in his career decided to release The Way I Were, whose 14 songs were recorded on a four-track betweeb 1986 to 1992. Not only does it serve as a reminder of what made him so compelling in the first place, but it also indicates that Johnston hasn't forgotten that he can turn his supposed weaknesses into strengths. Packed with songs that sound like they were made up on the spot, The Way I Were is Johnston's best release in years. Part of the album's appeal is its endearing goofiness and why-the-hell-not spontaneity. As witty and imaginative as they are, even Johnston's best records aren't exactly jovial, but The Way I Were exhibits a keen sense of humor, from its Streisantic title to the cassette-tape artwork to the silliness of ""Happy Birthday"", in which Johnston duets with himself. On ""This Really Happened"", he recounts an eventful night at a bar called the Trouble Tree (which provided a name for his first album) and repeatedly interrupts himself to warble drunkenly, ""Long ago, and oh so far away!"" And ""The Enchanted Car"" would be a toss-off if not for its enchanted bass line and the cracked humor with which Johnston sings the phrase ""she's a canceled coupe."" The album's basic recording technology complements this sense of fun, even as it adds gritty gravity to tracks like ""Light of Doubt"" and ""When the Cryin's Done"". In this four-track setting, Johnston pares his songs down to their essential elements; untouched by studio polish or professional solemnity, the songs sound direct and immediate. Even so, Johnston is still sonically adventurous: The tongue-in-cheek ""Love Songs About Girls"" has a flamenco flourish and ""I Can't Stop Shaking"" dices his vocals on its chorus. Johnston works well within these confines, which were admittedly the result of circumstances rather than of a specific aesthetic approach. He recorded these songs in his early twenties, after he had moved from Lawrence, Kan., to New York City, but before he signed with Bar None and sold family farmland to pay for Can You Fly? and its tour-- as well as before he felt the fade-out of two poorly received albums. His youthful optimism comes across on every track: The Way I Were is a self-portrait of an artist with all the ups and downs of his career still ahead of him.","Thankfully, the latest Freedy Johnston release isn't that new-- it's a collection of early four-track demos.

The Curse of the Longest Day EP,31Knots,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab6b9d034d5c69bf4010/1:1/w_160/7fbcd8c8.gif,2004-12-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8986-the-curse-of-the-longest-day-ep/,Stiff Slack,"Earlier this year, Portland, Oregon-based 31 Knots released It Was High Time to Escape, an LP of streamlined indie-prog, on the small label 54-40-or-Fight! Records. It was so immediately appealing that it quickly jumped out of the random promo slush pile and into my permanent collection. The band's technical prowess, singularity of vision, and potent songcraft (not to mention singer Joe Haege's accomplished vocal range) make it difficult to believe that they've garnered so little national acclaim. As the grassroots press network continues to ossify, it's easy to forget that there are good bands operating outside of the high-profile indie labels, and how exciting it is to stumble across one. It's possible that 31 Knots will continue to dispatch their sleek, expansive compositions from the figurative wilderness, but as they search for stateside distribution for their new EP, The Curse of the Longest Day, I'll be shocked if one of the big indies doesn't snap it up. For now, it's available on Japanese label Stiff Slack Records (you'll find ordering information below). Even if their songs weren't so striking in and of themselves, this new EP finds 31 Knots positioning themselves for greater interest. It was mixed and mastered by Deerhoof's Greg Saunier and the band is preparing to tour Europe with Q and Not U, who-- shorn of their more spastic tendencies-- would be a feasible point of reference for 31 Knots. The importance of 31 Knots's rhythm section, the two Jays (Pellicci and Winebrenner), shouldn't be underplayed: Their supple, delicately shifting armature is a vital component of the songs' impact. But the central figure in the band is Joe Haege, who's responsible for the lyrics, vocals, guitars, samples, and piano. It's Haege's voice that first draws you to 31 Knots-- it's a powerful instrument, evoking operatic singers from Jason Molina to Jeff Buckley to Craig Wedren. Haege forgoes the mealy-mouthed style of the day and sings from the diaphragm; his voice is resonant and clear as a bell. The EP comprises four new songs and one untitled instrumental interlude. It opens with ""Welcome to Stop"", which stutters and coasts through woozy, heavily distorted slides; intense broadsides of staccato chords; and wiry runs of plinking guitar. Featuring Haege's most aggressive vocal performance and densest instrumentation, it's sharply contrasted by the EP's second (and strongest) track. ""The Corpse and the Carcass"" is a lean, minimally symphonic piece; the cinematic evocation of its succinct, reiterative synthetic-string-and-piano phrases instantly evoke the creeping micro-grandeur of Kronos Quartet's Requiem for a Dream soundtrack. While Haege's lyrics tend toward the ponderous and obscure, the music is sturdy enough to hold their weight, and here he pares them down to suit the leanness of the music: ""Who's the gospel, and who is the plain truth?/ Who's the misprint, and who is just slander?"" The unlisted instrumental is a brief interlude of winnowing, coiled ambience in the center of the EP. ""The Story of Ivan Normal"" works through so many guitar modes over its gymnastic percussion-- wafting arpeggios, syncopated leads, poppy strumming, and clattering post-punk-- that it's remarkable it coheres into a catchy, hummable tune. And ""Coward With Claws"", a morass of rambling Shudder to Thinkisms pinioned with apocalyptic digital rumbles, closes an EP that presents a unity of vision with no discernible chinks. I'd say I expect great things from 31 Knots if I didn't feel that they've already accomplished them. Now it's just a matter of waiting for the word to spread.","Oregon-based indie band's crown is frontman Joe Haege's vocal range, which recalls Magnolia Electric Co's Jason Molina, Jeff Buckley, and Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren.

Where Will You Be Christmas Day?,Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81813d1975652139595/1:1/w_160/4ca4e1ef.jpg,2004-12-02 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2040-where-will-you-be-christmas-day/,Dust-to-Digital,"Whining shrilly about the commercialization of Christmas may be a tired, stupid pursuit, but nothing speaks more to our contemporary holiday-bastardization than the insane devolution of our Christmas songs. As a genre, ""Christmas music"" is near-dead and embarrassingly cheap: overwrought, gloppy anthologies litter Pottery Barn checkout counters, get tucked into cereal boxes, and pipe out endlessly from shitty, strip mall speakers, stuffing our list-wielding ears with tinny, impossibly canned sounds. Plenty of ""Classic Christmas"" anthologies are released and purchased every year (almost always with noble intentions), but if they manage to escape being blankly tossed post-holiday, they usually just end up crammed haphazardly into dented cardboard boxes, left to rub up against plush, sweater-sporting reindeer and dysfunctional strings of tiny white lights. They are accessories, disposable and meaningless, inherently temporary: They are far from sacred. Where Will You Be Christmas Day?, curated by ace musicologist Dick Spottswood (and based loosely on his Washington, D.C. radio show), is the latest release from Atlanta's fledgling Dust-to-Digital, the same label that produced the mind-blowing Goodbye, Babylon box late last year. And much like Goodbye, Babylon, this record will leave you wondering why the 1960s are the years everyone always gets so mournfully nostalgic for. Charming, challenging, and endlessly captivating, Where Will You Be Christmas Day? is the kind of quasi-seasonal anthology that you'll totally dig out in July, popsicles and all, suddenly craving (if not requiring) its quiet, unmatched grace. Drawing heavily from early American folk, jazz, and blues (and incorporating classic holiday songs from the Ukraine, Italy, Trinidad, and Puerto Rico), the tracks included here date from 1917 to 1959, and represent an impressive spectrum of vocal styles, stretching from four-note sacred harp hooting to brash, mid-century gospel. Consequently, Where Will You Be Christmas Day? is compelling simply as an anthropological peek, a crackly glimpse at secular traditions-in-the-making-- but all Smithsonian-geekiness aside, the music itself is more than satisfying, loaded with plenty of fresh, regional glee. Delta-blues gurus Lightnin' Hopkins and Lead Belly each contribute tracks, as do The Alabama Sacred Harp Singers, Fiddlin' John Carson and His Virginia Reelers, Butterbeans and Susie, The Cotton Top Mountain Sanctified Singers, Los Jibaros, Kansas City Kitty, Bessie Smith, and 14 others-- even the tracklisting reads like poetry. Most of these cuts are swimming in tape hiss, and if the songs aren't performed a capella, the instrumentation is modest at best. Still, what's lost via archaic microphones and questionable technology is more than made up for by a complete lack of post-production studio tweakery: voices are wild and occasionally off-key, swinging earnestly from note to note, shining in their full, one-take glory. Ultimately, what's most striking about this collection is how unapologetically warm, triumphant, and giggly the whole thing is: Unlike a lot of heavy, brooding Christmas songs (see the plodding gravity of ""Silent Night""), Where Will You Be Christmas Day? is defiantly plucky, far more concerned with celebration than meditation. Despite Spottswood's liner-note pledge to mix the sacred and secular, the respectable and the rowdy, he seems to concentrate mainly on conveying each performer's joy, regardless of their affiliations. Opener ""The Last Month of Year"", howled a capella by Vera Hall Ward (and recorded in Tuscaloosa, Ala., in late 1959), is full of vocal cartwheels and semi-possessed yelps, emphatic and jubilant at the very same time. ""Holy Babe"", a rollicking collaboration between Kelly Pace, Aaron Brown, Joe Green, Paul Hayes, and Matthew Johnson, is a choral masterpiece, their raucous hoots and mmm-mmm's weaving together in unexpected accord. The Alabama Sacred Harp Singers roar through ""Sherburne"", while Butterbeans and Susie's ""Papa Ain't No Santa Claus (and Mama Ain't No Christmas Tree)"" is sublimely weird, all talking-blues and rhythmic caterwauling. There's plenty of humor to be found here, too-- Lord Beginner's ""Christmas Morning the Rum Had Me Yawning"" and Leroy Carr's ""Christmas in Jail - Ain't That a Pain"" are hilariously heartfelt in their earnest, bad-boy remorse. So while Where Will You Be Christmas Day? is perfectly wonderful for tree-trimming and Charlie Brown-style dance-hopping, its true triumph is its uncanny longevity: It will last longer than your evergreen.","Dust-to-Digital-- the label that last year brought us the magnificent Goodbye, Babylon, a six-disc box set of early gospel music-- spoils us again with...Christmas music? So this holiday season, put down that Burl Ives album and check out this compilation of mostly early 20th century yuletide sounds. Together, these folk, jazz, blues, and calyspo tracks create a quasi-seasonal anthology that you'll still dig out in July, suddenly craving (if not requiring) its quiet, unmatched grace.

Welcome to the North,The Music,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c421c0084474cd0c360d/1:1/w_160/2bf023db.jpg,2004-12-01 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5523-welcome-to-the-north/,Capitol,"The Music is a hell of thing to name your band. There's an arrogance to it but at the same time, it's just about the least creative, least clever name you could give to a band-- especially since we've already had The Band and The The. If you're going to adopt the generic term for your chosen art form as your band's moniker you had damn well better make music that flattens the earth, because if you don't you will be easily forgotten. And those who are interested won't even be able to find you on the Internet because your handle brings up more than a million results. Two albums in, I am not convinced that The Music will ever be a band that can transcend their stupid name. Their eponymous first album at least dabbled in eclecticism and flirted with dance rhythms and electronic textures alongside their big 70s rock riffs rock, but Welcome to the North actually narrows the band's scope, morphing the Leeds quartet into a nu-Zeppelin pop Dream Theater with a vocalist that sounds a lot like Geddy Lee or a cartoon or maybe a cartoon of Geddy Lee. In a way, The Music are lot like Oasis, in that everything they do is huge, but none of what they do is original at all. In a pinch, you could accurately describe them as a denser Red Rider. Clearly, the band believes that working in nothing but sweeping gestures and keeping subtlety at arm's length is the quickest route to changing lives one stadium full of them at a time. There's a possibility that they're correct: The mountain-crushing riff that tears up the opening of ""Freedom Fighters"" certainly kicks adequate ass, but when they let you listen to this stuff for an hour, it's pretty clear that this band has nothing to say outside of platitudes and only a couple of ways to say it. Over the course of both ballads and rockers, the album is utterly monochromatic, and I can't understand how such basic hard rock can sound so dreadfully awful on headphones-- the production, courtesy of Brendan O'Brien, is hopelessly cluttered and flat given the relatively basic setup. Guitarist Adam Nutter must have about 60 effects boxes to trip over in the studio, but were he restricted to some vacuum tube distortion and reverb he'd be three times as powerful as he is here with his overly digital, grayed-out tone. The best thing about this band is drummer Phil Jordan, whose shuffling, propulsive beats and auxiliary percussion additions save essentially every song from potential complete collapse. He's all that redeems the awful ballad ""Bleed From Within"", which begins as a limp U2 homage with lyrics like ""The sun is bleeding into mine eye"" and ""When darkness falls there will be war/ I'm bleeding/ Yeah, I'm bleeding from within."" The chorus, whose sole word is ""burn"" repeated over and over again is reasonably buoyant, but this song goes nowhere until Jordan's beat takes center stage and the rest of the band just hangs on for the ride. Vocalist Robert Harvey tries his best to ruin it with inexplicably horrendous wordless vocalizations but on an album where the band flails for gripping moments, you take what you can get. As much as they try to break your heart and lift your downtrodden spirit, The Music really aren't up to the task, and it's a wide open question as to whether they ever will be. They have general technical proficiency and a knack for a good riff, but listening to them is nevertheless a chore-- and a boring, repetitive one at that.","The Music is a hell of thing to name your band.

718,Theodore Unit,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88fea9e61561daa5853/1:1/w_160/a99459e6.jpg,2004-12-01 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8276-718/,Sure Shot,"For Ghostface and his Theodore Unit, 718-- a collection of outtakes from this year's The Pretty Toney Album-- is all about freedom: The freedom to host as many guest MCs as possible, to experiment with samples that could have seemed too outlandish on Pretty Toney, to be brash and angry and emotionally honest, and to call out ""faggot niggas"" at every turn. That The Pretty Toney Album has criminally underperformed seems to defeat the commercial mandate for an outtakes collection, but the bevy of surplus material is surprisingly consistent; Ghostface's first entry under the Theodore Unit moniker serves as a nice, if unnecessary, accessory to its criminally unsuccessful counterpart. 718 compiles recent mixtape tracks that didn't make the cut for Pretty Toney and a handful of previously unreleased odds and ends. But the continuity, strength of production, and sharpness of the record's guest lineup suggests a good deal of forethought. A track like ""Guerilla Hood"", for instance, which would have sat favorably in the Pretty Toney tracklist, was probably reserved with a side project in mind. ""Punch In Punch Out"" is a fairly straightforward battle-rhyme-cum-testament to black market business operations. Pejoratives like Trife's: ""You's a has-been/ Always will, always have been/ That garbage you pumpin'/ You need to save it for the trash bin,"" roam over a brooding beat underpinned by a single sustained synth note. ""88 Freestyle"" features some nimble verses but the song is sullied by a particularly garish sample: A wailing, vaguely Middle Eastern guitar bend that feels awkwardly wedged in. Lest we forget this isn't a Ghostface solo effort, ""The Drummer"" brings a cast to make Ocean's Eleven soil its pants. On previous outings, such generosity has been an invitation to unwelcome distractions, but here the MCs' interplay is arch, transitioning quickly from voice to voice over a breathy, crackling beat. Even Method Man drops in for a droopy verse. Despite this being a decidedly populist affair, the tawdry, blaxploitation production and the tic-addled vehemence of Ghostface's verses are intact. But beyond its reliably scruffy sound, the sampling on 718 is-- with a few catchy, well-placed exceptions-- chintzy. ""Mama Can You Hear Me"" thrives off the nervous trills of an overwrought orch-pop ballad, while ""Smith Brothers"" uses a stinging string line and cops Queen in its bawdy chorus: A serpentine verse fit to a familiar cadence before the telltale, ""Tell 'em, 'We will, we will rock you...pop you.'"" Such witticisms pervade the album but, on the whole, 718 is more introspective than previous Ghostface releases. Whereas in the past Ghostface has been preoccupied with gregarious, almost parodically violent lyrics, 718's ""Mama Can You Hear Me"" and ""Who Are We"" show a touching vulnerability. On the former, Solomon Childs levels charged laments (""This the projects/ Summertime ain't comin'"") in a huge baritone swollen with echo. Of course, amid this panoply of competent lyricists, Ghostface still shines. But his closest competitor remains Trife, whose verses, delivered in a thick, cocky cadence that sounds naturally double tracked, are among 718's finest. It's hard to imagine why Trife doesn't yet have a solo album to his credit, but his spots on Supreme Clientele, Pretty Toney, and now 718 have given him a fantastic endorsement. Though undoubtedly strong, 718 is a pale stand-in for a proper Ghostface full-length. That's because it's a different record, more varied, more scattershot. Even so, Ghostface chose the right men to surround himself with. Commercially feasible or not, 718 features enough stylish production and idiosyncratic rapping to service Ghostface's reputation while providing the Theodore Unit stable with a cornerstone for its own.","Another unfabulous collection of classic 70s rock riffs, recorded by today's most irrelevant artists!

Homeland,Fan Modine,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beabc0084474cd0c2f07/1:1/w_160/621c9e70.jpg,2004-12-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3331-homeland/,Grimsey,"Would-be connoisseurs are sometimes too quick to dismiss certain wispy indie pop by using Mike Myers' ever-potent barb: ""If it's not Scottish, it's crap!"" Despite the obvious nods to The Pastels or Belle & Sebastian, that's never been true-- even if you don't have enough patience for Australia's The Lucksmiths. For one thing, forebears like Felt and The Field Mice hailed from England, not Scotland. For another, albums like Fan Modine's Homeland provide a sparkling reminder of the winsome pop gems in American listeners' backyards. On this sophomore effort, Fan Modine mastermind Gordon Zacharias draws from the elegance of early Magnetic Fields and the groove-based intimacy of The Folk Implosion more than, say, Beat Happening, the original exception to the Scotophiliac rule. But where 69 Love Songs often focused on love's ironies (""Love Is Like a Bottle of Gin""), Homeland is an unabashed paean to its peaks. While One Part Lullaby explored Lou Barlow's alienation after moving across the country (""E.Z.L.A.""), Fan Modine's latest, as its title implies, is about that elusive, invaluable feeling of ""home."" The album's centerpiece is ""Pageantry"", which pits a hushed, theatrical vocal against burbling Her Space Holiday-esque orchestration. ""Pageantry walks through the door,"" Zacharias exults at his most Stephin Merritt-like, ""and I keep repeating track number four."" Originally released as a seven-inch in 1999, ""Pageantry"" has been a long time coming to CD-- although it didn't really need to be slotted at track four, did it? Save that for the many hopeful mixtapes this song is sure to grace. The previous song, ""We Are All Decades"", is the one most explicitly influenced by Lou Barlow's extra-Sebadoh noodlings. The prominent bass line and Barlow-esque, double-tracked vocal wouldn't have been out of place alongside Folk Implosion breakthrough ""Natural One"" on the Kids soundtrack, though some subtle vocoder adds a new twist. The lyrics might fit an elliptical collaboration between Sentridoh and Cole Porter: ""The more you placate everybody/ The less you can escape the world/ Act tall to the street vendor."" Homeland is arguably less ambitious than Fan Modine's debut, the self-released 1998 concept album Slow Road to Tiny Empire. But improved confidence and recording quality shore up a batch of songs that find beauty in the familiar as much as the abstract. Zacharias lent his elegant voice to this year's charming debut by orchestral pop duo Hercules, who return the favor with string arrangements and co-production duties on four songs here. Wordier than Zacharias' Hercules outings, these tunes expand on the violin-soaked palette of ""Pageantry"", awash in pleasant decadence. Opening with modest acoustic guitar strums, first track ""Newsstand of the Sun"" blossoms into a Mancini-esque discovery of romance. If not for further Merritt-esque lyrics about dandies, Bentleys and lion cages, ""Waiting in the Wings"" could fit on Hercules' In the Alleyway-- here, the song plays like an adaptation of the Henry James story The Beast in the Jungle, with worldly riches rather than overweening egoism preventing this John Marcher from finding ""one true love."" Though Homeland's theme emerges early on, a Hercules collaboration cements it. Amid the bouncy tin pan alley of ""Throughout Your Life"", Zacharias masterfully toes the line between fine gruyere and common EZ Cheez. ""There's nothing quite like knowing where you belong,"" he sings, asking a lover to marry him with heartbreaking earnestness you won't find on the new Jimmy Eat World album. For now, Zacharias apparently belongs in Carrboro, N.C., where he has put together a new quintet incarnation of Fan Modine including former members of Jets to Brazil, Polvo, and Idyll Swords. Good pop belongs wherever you hear it-- thanks, Scotland, but occasionally we Yanks get it right.","American indie poppers' latest outing draws from the elegance of early Magnetic Fields and the intimacy of bedroom four-trackers like Lou Barlow.

Catch the Breeze,Slowdive,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69013d19756521391f0/1:1/w_160/abb88ce9.gif,2004-12-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7791-catch-the-breeze/,Sanctuary,"Gosh does liking music make you feel prematurely old! Last winter, while browsing in a record store, I came across a compilation of shoegazer tracks, sitting there with all the finality of a collection of 60s garage. All of these bands with their echoes and their noise-- even Blind Mr. Jones! A few racks over-- you know, by the deluxe anniversary editions of Pavement records-- I got shaky. Is this what we're doing now: Packing up the 90s for posterity? And why should finality be a grave? Some reappraisal is necessary, and when it comes to those shoegazers, that goes double. As popular as the whole scene was, too many people have spent too many years saying nothing more interesting about these bands than that they weren't quite as good as My Bloody Valentine. And of all the bands that were stuck with that claim, Slowdive is the one for whom it was the most damnably untrue. These days we all know that, in the end, Slowdive were hardly shoegazers at all. That didn't stop them from recording some of the classics of the genre, but still: There's something in this work-- from the earliest singles to the beyond-rock of their last album-- that's just singularly theirs, something that's made them as influential to today's electronic music artists (or, hell, to goths) as they have been for rock kids. Listening to Catch the Breeze-- which comfortably abridges a three-album career onto two discs-- you get an immediate sense of why. Frontman Neil Halstead's songs have a narcotic languor to them, a quality that makes them sound like he's constantly on the verge of drifting off. But there's something about the deliberate haze of this stuff-- the layers of echoing guitar they wrap songs in, the way the vocals emerge as distant angel moans-- that gives every word and chord a massive intensity. It's like watching film in slow motion: Everything goes watery-dreamy, but it also takes on a weight and a drama that can crush. And through every stage of their career, that's the heart of Slowdive. You're lulled into sleepy waves of melody, the hazy druggy beauty of it all, but just as you're drifting away, the whole thing squalls up into a big crushing storm or drops off into disorienting darkness. People try it with guitars and they try it with computers, and nobody does it quite like this. So three albums, two discs. The draw for longtime fans is a selection of tracks from the band's earliest singles. This was as close as they came to sounding like a conventional rock band-- albeit a huge, deep, and sleepy one, with Halstead and Rachel Goswell already crooning with lazy grace. By my count there are eight tracks here that aren't available on the band's three albums (assuming you have the expanded U.S. version of Souvlaki), including a Peel Session cover of Syd Barrett's ""Golden Hair""-- convenient enough if you don't feel like hunting down 12-inches. The band's first LP, Just for a Day, is underrepresented here, most likely due to its occasionally fluffy, over-prettified production; instead, things leap straight on to the band's two classics, starting with 1993's Souvlaki. Owners of that U.S. edition will find 10 of its tracks included here, and with good reason. This album is, dare I say, every bit as good as Loveless, and just as singular. What's amazing about it is the way Halstead's exquisite pop songwriting comes so strongly to the forefront of the band's sound-- and meshes, magically, with an even greater sonic ambition. The result is the reason critics started calling things ""dream-pop,"" and the best songs here-- ""Alison"" and ""40 Days""-- sound exactly like that: gorgeous traditional pop songs heard in blurry, dreamlike slow motion, sleepy and crushing at the same time. Even more ambitious are the tracks that stemmed from the band's collaboration with Brian Eno-- songs like ""Sing"" and ""Souvlaki Space Station"", which wash out into dubby groove and echo, with vocals pushed back into the role of instruments. Two years later, the band released something else entirely-- a collection of songs recorded mostly by Halstead, with a sound that left the rock-band format behind altogether. The past few years have seen a huge revival of interest in this kind of thing: The ""lost generation"" of bands-- Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, Seefeel-- for whom Simon Reynolds coined the term ""post-rock."" It's in those terms that Slowdive's last album, Pygmalion, has come to seem like the best thing Halstead has been involved with. The highlight, ""Blue Skied an' Clear"", is worth the price of any collection anyone sticks it on: It's one of the most achingly pretty things you'll ever hear, milking incredible pathos from a shuffling drum loop, sparkling touches of guitar, and a chorus of ghostly half-moaning vocals. ""Crazy for You"" goes even further, constructing another rush of sound and then building it up and breaking it down like dance music. Catch the Breeze nicks a full five songs from Pygmalion, an album only nine tracks long-- and for Americans, it's more than worth it: This LP can be criminally hard to find. And that's Slowdive, in a handy two-disc set, packed and packaged. There's a scent of finality about it. This, in most cases, will be all the Slowdive anyone needs. There's a quintessential Slowdive-listening experience: You lie in bed letting those waves of sound wash over you; you drift comfortably off into dreamworld, thinking of big pretty oceans; and then you wake up, minutes later, to find a big disorienting blur shooting out of your speakers-- so massive, so intensively vivid, or so dark and ominous, that you wonder how you could sleep to this at all. It's like taking a sleeping pill and waking up to find yourself frighteningly, alarmingly drugged-- an experience I wish, fondly, on everyone who brings this collection home.","This new two-disc compilation neatly cuts through these seminal shoegazers' three-album, multiple-single career, compacting all their best work into one handy, chronologically arranged collection that moves from the lush and delicate to the dark and ominous-- and all while making the case that the band transcended their genre to become both ""lost generation"" compatriots of post-rock and a massive influence on today's indie-leaning electronic artists.

Aha Shake Heartbreak,Kings of Leon,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc205e6ef95969322d8d/1:1/w_160/67299671.jpg,2004-11-30 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4560-aha-shake-heartbreak/,RCAHand Me Down,"Kings of Leon's schtick is that they have no schtick: They're just four stand-up guys who happen to be in a rock band. They're from a small town in eastern Tennessee; three of them are brothers and the fourth is a cousin; the brothers are minister's kids; all four were home-schooled. All of which marks them as outsiders-- people untouched by industry politics or expectations who are just playing rock'n'roll 'cause they're livin' it, man! But Kings of Leon's insistence on their own honest naturalism-- from their time-capsule haircuts to Caleb Followill's overexpressive vocals to their terrible album titles-- seems disingenuous, especially in a genre (Southern rock) that prizes realness and grumbles at pretensions. The Followill clan wouldn't last a week in The Drive-By Truckers' Dirty South. Aha Shake Heartbreak, the follow-up to last year's bewilderingly well-received Youth and Young Manhood, is an update on the previous album's Southern bar-band rock, with just enough Nuggets-style pop chops to impress hipsters and critics. If the hooks aren't as good this time, the songs are more sculpted and succinct, with a greater sense of urgency and economy. On the other hand, these dozen tracks don't really mean anything. Sure, they're about stuff like women and being in a band, but they sound deeply impersonal, and often obligatory in their lazy misogyny (""Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up"") and lazier obtuseness (""He's so the purity, the shaven and the mourning""-- even Beck is more coherent). Caleb sings about a girl with an ""hourglass body"" who ""has problems with drinking milk and being school tardy/ She'll loan you her toothbrush/ She'll bartend your party,"" but it doesn't sound like he actually knows anyone like that. Instead, the song's about a rock'n'roll archetype-- the wild heartbreaker, the man-eater, the endearing groupie-- and it never manages to transcend the blandly conceptual. Elsewhere, the lyrics are so self-referential they're almost narcissistic. Songs like ""Slow Night, So Long"" and ""Four Kicks"" are about what hard-livin' good ol' boys the Followills are. In particular, ""Soft"" is stupid sex wordplay that would be insulting if it weren't so self-deprecating: ""I'm passed out in your garden...I'd pop myself in your body/ I'd come into your party but I'm soft."" One word: eww. Another favorite topic is the harsh realities of endless touring and low-level fame, as if having a major-label promote you and Dave Eggers worship you in print are such hardships. But on ""Day Old Blues"" Caleb observes that ""Girls are gonna love the way I toss my hair/ Boy are going to hate the way I seem."" This boy in particular thinks that's the key to what makes this band such a bunch of fakes: They're more interested in appearances than in their music. Those haircuts don't appear anywhere in nature. On the other hand, maybe it's just the way Caleb sings that and every other line on Aha Shake Heartbreak. He is a terrible singer, like a drunken Randy Newman with Tourette's-- which would be a compliment if it didn't make you expect more intelligent lyrics. On just about every song here he lets loose a flurry of words in some bizarre approximation of backwater sass, but it just sounds willful and grating. On ""Day Old Blues"", he turns some lyrics into almost scat-like utterances while painfully overenunciating others. He's shooting for some sort of Southern-slash-Appalachian accent, but ultimately he defies geography and just sounds unnatural. The album's one redeeming element is the band itself, who-- over the course of one EP and two albums-- have improved tenfold. They're tighter, more dynamic, and much more confident on Aha Shake Heartbreak than they were on Youth and Young Manhood. Granted, they still sound like they're descended from The Strokes and other garage bands rather than from southern royalty like Lynyrd Skynyrd or even Southern pop like The Gants or The Scruffs. Their boogie may have crawled out of Williamsburg instead of some backwater swamp, but Nathan, Jared, and Matthew Followill manage to incorporate vintage elements into their music without sounding overly nostalgic (which is the pitfall of soundalikes Thee Shams). ""Slow Night, So Long"" finds a twist ending in a slow coda, and songs like ""The Bucket"" and ""Razz"" pop and bounce elastically. With its hand-claps and staccato guitars, ""Taper Jean Girl"" struts such undeniable bad-ass energy that you may find yourself singing along, although you'll want to make up your own words.","Kings of Leon's schtick is that they have no schtick: They're just four stand-up guys who happen to ...

Galaxies' Incredible Sensual Transmission Field of the Tower Recordings,Tower Recordings,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88eb1335d7bf16992e7/1:1/w_160/774421bb.gif,2004-11-30 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8275-galaxies-incredible-sensual-transmission-field-of-the-tower-recordings/,Communion,"Though most of us were none the wiser at the time, it turns out that the musicians assembled in 2001 to play on the Tower Recording's Folk Scene comprised a virtual Wu-Tang Clan of subterranean psych-folk. Since the release of that landmark album, the members of the loose-knit troupe have branched out and done their share to expand the sonic parameters of the enlightened American underground. In the past couple of years, Pat (P.G. Six) Gubler, Samara Lubelski, and Dean Roberts all released noteworthy solo albums, as well as recordings with other various outfits such as Autistic Daughters and Hall of Fame. Tim Barnes has played with Neil Haggerty, made a cameo on Wilco's A Ghost is Born, and operated his adventurous Quakebasket label, among other projects. Perhaps busiest of all has been Matt (MV) Valentine, who presides over the astonishing Child of Microtones CD-R empire through which he's unleashed a deluge of recordings both solo and in duet with Erika (EE) Elder. All of this activity has understandably helped foster curiosity about the work of the full Tower Recordings ensemble, so now Barnes and Valentine have gone back through their old tapes and compiled this new collection of Folk Scene-era material. A veritable rogues' gallery of instrumental talent, the Tower Recordings of that era were conversant in a remarkable array of progressive folk dialects, and their resulting sound was a motley pastiche of gentle acoustic balladry, the psychedelic exoticisms of the Incredible String Band or Comus, and feral ESP-derived pagan thud. And though it contains many passages of exhilarating beauty, Folk Scene remains an odd record by any measuring stick; its oddity accentuated by short song lengths (most of its 22 tracks are under 2 minutes long) and wild mood shifts that can at times make it a jarring, difficult listen. This problem has been rectified on Galaxies' Incredible Sensual Transmission Field. (Apparently, the group has been taking album-titling advice from Acid Mothers Temple.) Recorded in a church in upstate New York, the group here sounds loose and live, and the extended running time of these six tracks allows the group to open all of its sails and draw some serious steam. ""Harvester"" opens the album with a shambling chug, as a mysterious heap of guitar strings and scraping fiddle bows eventually collapses and permits steadfast columns of clackety percussion to carry the day. Though it takes a couple of minutes to get up to full fire, once everybody is onboard this track neatly anticipates avenues that would eventually be explored further by Sunburned Hand of the Man. ""Empress of I-91"" brings in more jingle bells, handclaps, horns (recorders, maybe?), and a graspable melody, sounding like what the residents of the Wicker Man island may have enjoyed. (Although, unfortunately, Britt Eckland is nowhere to be seen.) Throughout these songs the only constant is change. Every time a piece risks growing stale through repetition someone in the room introduces a brand new element of sound-- a tinny piano, a distorted harmonica, a taped snatch of drone. And though this technique ensures a continuous succession of surprises, it also means the listener must endure the occasional patch of uninspired chaos as the band patiently pursues the next magical and elusive moment of cohesion. Thankfully, Galaxies' Incredible Blah Blah also succeeds in capturing so many of those moments that you'll likely find yourself hoping there will soon come a time when all of these talented individuals can once again assemble together under one banner.","A virtual Wu-Tang Clan of subterranean psych-folk

Von,Sigur Rós,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fcc0084474cd0c03c8/1:1/w_160/eb57c81b.gif,2004-11-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7154-von/,Bad TasteBad Taste,"Before Sigur Ros won the inaugural Shortlist Prize in 2001 for Agaetis Byrjun, they composed another album that would have met the award's criteria. Fewer than 500,000 copies sold? Hell, Von initially printed less than 500. A shining example of sacrosanct iconoclasm? Truly. Kitschy and tongue-in-cheek enough to win over Jack Black (who this year championed Eagles of Death Metal as his sole nomination)? Well, they're Icelandic. Around the release of Agaetis Byrjun, Sigur Ros promised to ""change music...and the way people think about music"" forever. Whereas on that record-- nestled cozily inside a fully realized voice-- they sounded up to the task, Von is weighted down by the band's bodacious ambition. At 72 minutes, the album is bloated with ideas Sigur Ros would refine on their sophomore outing. As such, it's an exciting look back at a once-mysterious group who leaped from obscurity to mug the mainstream. Young, earnest, eerie, and overzealous, Von is a unique, almost belligerently unaffiliated piece of music that unsubtly blazons its idiosyncrasies. Naturally, Von kicks off with a bold mission statement: ""Sigur Ros"", which is purposefully stagnant and entirely too long. At more than nine minutes in length, the track is an ambient impasse, a slow-moving mass of nothing much. Imagine the nebulous prelude of Agaetis Byrjun opener ""Intro"" stretched to 10 times its original length and without a tension-breaker like ""Sven-G-Englar"" to empty into. ""Dogun"" prolongs the shapelessness, though in a slightly more affable fashion: The song features the sort of ethereal, reverb-laden choral intonations that tread the fenceline between blissed-out psych and Enya-style therapop. But the voices are eventually fed through a voicebox and garbled beyond recognition, establishing Sigur Ros on the edgier side of the divide. Things don't really get off the ground until ""Hun Jord"". Centered around a harrowing vocal refrain, the song paints with darker hues than Sigur Ros' newer material, but still bears the band's unmistakable emblem. Tape splices chatter through the opening section before a sludgy guitar and martial drums enter to pilot the fracas. Uncharacteristically, one can actually hear a well-defined set of reference points here, including Mogwai, Hawkwind, and Spacemen 3. For the most part, however, Von is very distant from its time. Even in its most conventional moments, Von sounds utterly unlike anything from the period, and is only tentatively allusive of the band's fecund latter-day output. ""Myrkur"", though redolent of Pink Floyd and Hum, is happily and naively detached. Much like Agaetis Byrjun, Von thrives on a certain amount of landscaping-- wandering the Icelandic countryside is a surreal and uncanny experience, one that Sigur Ros convey beautifully. But in sounding so consciously epic, the album comes across more self-aware-- and thus less powerful-- than its offspring. Rather, it's a rugged, cave-dwelling cousin to Agaetis Byrjun's stargazing hopefulness and environmentalism.","Before Agaetis Byrjun turned Sigur Ros into a Shortlist Prize-winning, Radiohead-tipped band of the moment, they released this record, now reissued by One Little Indian.

As Woven Hand, Edwards has yet to miss a beat. Though it's still framed as a ""side project,"" with Consider the Birds, his third and strongest solo effort, Edwards achieves a passionate pitch that eternally eclipses his output with his proper band, 16 Horsepower. Begeting a monumental sound hinted at on past efforts, these 10 tracks are denser and more layered than the ethereal path walked by last year's beautiful Blush Music, a record that more and more reminds me of a cracked and icy music box left to disintegrate back into the damp earth. On Consider the Birds, as though concocted with quicksand, new sounds escape from each composition over subsequent listens-- little last gasps from a toy piano show up here, a last-minute snare hit there. The works are pocked with these shadowed corners: the dark, oaken sounds of barn-raising banjo, upright bass, and guitar as well as cymbal crashes, cattail taps, possessed howls, and the faint flapping of lark wings. The elegant piano that shuffles beneath ""Speaking Hands"" is time again punctuated by crackling, splintery percussion. ""Down In The Forest"" rings ominously with bells of paradise. Its title referencing the Biblical passage about God providing for our feathered friends, Consider the Birds is a compelling cycle of blistering sermons, spare near-spoken ballads, and seesaw tales of faith and earthly toil. Aesthetically, it drifts alongside the Bonnie Prince and the Bad Seed in a starless tar-black stream. But world-weary Edwards is singular is his sustained scowl: Will Oldham saw a darkness then managed to chase that tear-in-his-beer with creaky back-porch jests; Nick Cave has kept an upside-down smile in place longer, but peppers the pulpit with insinuation and romance. Yes, Edwards' religiosity is hardcore to say the least, and his Old Testament God seems unforgiving and even violent (e.g. ""The world will bow/ The knees will be broken for those who don't know how""). In the swampy gypsy bayou of ""To Make A Ring"" Edwards beseeches nonbelievers to realize that ""judgment is not avoided by your unbelief/ Your lack of fear/ Nor by your prayers to any little idol here...The lord will not be mocked/ Not by you or me."" Gathering a gale force, the track ends with a hermetic sing-a-long around a burning maypole: ""We will weave our voice, we will weave our voice together and sing forever round the throne."" So, if like me you don't believe in God, then why listen? Well, because unlike empty teen angst or bitchy navel gazing, Edwards has a certified message and even with the spikes and thorns and judgments his work emerges from a compelling, otherworldly mindset. As our country turns further towards the conservative right, it makes sense to some to be suspicious of religiosity but from my atheistic vantage, Consider the Birds is pleasingly scabrous and utterly apocalyptic. Instead of peppering his work with brief/sappy/peachy references, Edwards unleashes a torrent. Accordingly, religion aside, Consider the Birds should please any and all fans of bleak testimonials and Valley-of-Darkness soundscapes. If you really do fear Godly cooties, block out Edwards lyrics (pretend he's speaking in undecipherable tongues or talking to his girlfriend) and instead take a walk along brittle pine needles with these dark melodies, virtuosic screeches, and that humid overbearingness of his stately vocalizations.","David Eugene Edwards thankfully takes another break from 16 Horsepower to deliver his third and strongest solo effort as Woven Hand.

Interim,The Fall,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3e13d197565213b4d3/1:1/w_160/b11702ae.jpg,2004-11-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2977-interim/,Hip Priest,"The Fall are brilliant. No, really, you've heard all of this before, but that's because it's true. Mark E. Smith's revolving door doesn't always push out masterpieces but the music is rarely less than fascinating, and the band's rigorously applied aesthetic blueprint nullifies the fatigue of their prolific tendencies. Their imperfection and profligate recording habits are part of what makes them one of my favorite bands, but with Interim the shit has finally hit the fan. I know MES can be somewhat cavalier regarding his fans and their expectations, but no one that I know of needs a disc like this. Interim-- aptly named as its sole purpose seems to be as space filler between proper LPs-- is a haphazard jumble of recent rehearsals and live recordings, with mastering levels randomly ranging from inaudible to deafening, fidelity that is consistently questionable but often awful, and a bizarre tracklisting that throws in a few new songs that are illicitly available on superior Peel Session bootlegs (and likely soon on a new Fall album), mock-ups of the tracks from The Real New Fall LP, and a few live recordings of old classics from the band's current lineup. In other words, no one really seems to have given much thought to this disc's actual value or purpose to fans, and it further muddies The Fall's already confusing and (to a newcomer) somewhat monolithic discography. And dammit, what makes this even more frustrating is that most of the material is quite good-- maybe not prime Fall, but strong. Really, I just got versions of ""Mod Mock Goth"", ""Theme From Sparta FC"", and ""Boxoctosis"" earlier this year, and those were better than these, and I like the rearrangement on the live take on This Nation's Saving Grace's fantastic ""Spoilt Victorian Child"", but the sound is terrible, with volume fluctuations and a disengaged vocal from MES sinks it further. Couldn't I just have a whole show with the current lineup? The new songs are often impressive, but why not just treat me to the whole Peel Session? Instead, ""Blindness"", (aka ""Blind Man""-- most of the songs here have slightly altered or adjusted titles) is just a nasty bassline and you're left trying to glean the rest of it through the fuzzy mud. ""All Clasp Hands"" sounds recorded by an audience member, and the crowd noise is irritating, though not quite as irritating as the odd and nearly constant clapping that sabotages ""What About Us?"" Why does the promising ""I'm Ronney the Oney"" cut off suddenly after a minute and a half? And what the hell is that beeping sound in the middle of ""Boxoctosis Alarum"" (again with the needlessly altered titles)? It comes in like someone's pager going off in the midst of a movie, and it's louder than anything else on the recording. Seriously, this is either a post-modernist experimental joke to see how many critics will call it genius or it's just plain sloppy and careless. I say all of this with considerable conflict, because I love The Fall and normally find their erratic inscrutability a part of their allure. The songs themselves are guilty of nothing, good as they are, but the presentation is all wrong. Fall cultists, beware, because the completist in you who forces you to buy this is laying an ambush. Non-cultists, don't even contemplate laying out a red cent for this. Get The Real New Fall LP. Get on the peer-to-peers and find the Peel Sessions, wait for a real live album and wait for the next LP, because this is not worth your time.","Mark E. Smith's iconic group releases yet another record-- this time it's a jumble of recent rehearsals, mock-ups of tracks from The Real New Fall LP, and a few live recordings of old classics by the band's current lineup.

Size Matters,Helmet,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0a7abf31b7dc71564cc/1:1/w_160/525a3c03.jpg,2004-11-29 06:01:40,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3812-size-matters/,Interscope,"The nu boss is born here: ""Two years ago, Page Hamilton-- singer, guitarist and founder of the proto-metal outfit Helmet-- was driving around Los Angeles with the radio on. The jock on duty had just debuted the hotly anticipated new track from some xFC-metal millionaires."" And, as you might have guessed, the story (and this promo pitch) ends in medias res, with Helmet, unwavering bastion of all things Hard and Rock, emerging from the dry ice mists of obscurity and obsolescence to rescue the tired, huddled, headbanging masses from the ever-growing throng of bare-ass emperors. Glory be unto they who bring forth The Rock for their people beset by The Rot, were that it be The Rock they actually bring forth. If Helmet had one thing going for them in their prime, it was a monochromatic discipline. They gave fans a gussied-up version of the working class scree proffered by Big Black and other Albini disciples. With Helmet, the guitars cut like lasers, not pavement saws. The rhythms were efficient and martial, not frenetically robotic. And while Albini's words were flecked with coal dust and offal and the scarring of 12-hour work days, Hamilton barked and yelped like a guy earning union wages with full benefits and 401K matching. Helmet did lack a certain visceral passion, but they were precise and exacting and brutal and-- when all the metaphors are bagged and tagged-- Helmet did indeed rock. It's safe to say that Helmet's million-dollar Interscope contract (inked circa 1991) paved the way for all the xFC-metal millionaires Hamilton now finds himself both befriending and opposing. So, of course, in the era the unnecessary umlaut-- when the sound that made Helmet well-respected kings of rock are now commonplace among both standard bearers (Deftones, Tool, Slipknot) and shysters (take your pick), and it's safe for MTV's ""Headbanger's Ball"" to return to the airwaves-- Helmet releases a record that's about as hard as a loofah. A DJ could easily slip tracks like ""Drug Lord"" and ""Unwound"" between offerings from Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age. In fact, Burning Airlines could probably sue for copyright infringement-- ""See You Dead"" : ""Wheaton Calling :: ""Ice Ice Baby"" : ""Under Pressure"". Instead of reinventing the wheel (or perhaps the tank tread), Helmet attempt to diversify their portfolio, offering dynamics and approachable melodies and other types of listener-friendly capitulations one wouldn't associate with the folks that dropped ""Meantime"" and ""Unsung"". The group's online bio claims Page & Co. (old Helmeteer Chris Traynor and new guys John Tempesta and Frank Bello-- veterans of Testament and Anthrax, respectively) didn't set out to make Meantime, Part II with this new record; rather, they made Wilma, a less varied version of their confounding post-breakthrough album Betty. Therein lies part of the problem. As I said, Helmet's strength is their lack of diversity-- the group is a lumbering, slow-footed, imposing heavyweight, and it succeeds by beating opponents into submission. It's awkward to witness such a gloriously thuggish monster vainly attempt the rope-a-dope. Part of this pop-centric bait-and-switch is shifting the focus away from the guitars and hi-hats towards the vocals. Unfortunately, the ""singing"" on Size Matters happens in two modes: the hoarse bark and the nasal sneer. Both of these styles are evident on the album's first track, ""Smart"", and neither do the group any favors. Page Hamilton as R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket (authoritative, stern) = yes, sir! Page Hamilton as R. Lee Ermey in Saving Silverman (emotive, awkward) = unfit for command. Worse yet, Helmet's clipped monosyllabic lyrical M.O. (consistent throughout their recorded output) doesn't jibe with this slight stylistic shift. It's safe to say that lyrics were never Helmet's strong suit (""I'd like to see you/ In two pieces/ Won't be walking/ Barely breathing/ I'd like to see you/ At my door/ We're together/ Like before""), but it's not going to do any good to draw attention to them. Granted, there's enough wicked fretwork and cool guitar noise throughout this record to both recall past glories and satiate those in need of a modern rock fix. Just be warned that there are some hoops to jump through. Also be wary if you believe the hype and are hoping that Helmet have returned to save us from the upstarts and charlatans who pass themselves off as metal. Indeed, Helmet have met the enemy-- and, unfortunately, the enemy is Helmet.","The nu boss is born here:

Getting Even,Losoul,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd5abf31b7dc7156032/1:1/w_160/045d1af7.jpg,2004-11-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4973-getting-even/,Playhouse,"Clicks are great but-- perhaps unsurprisingly-- clicked-out full-lengths can grow tiresome. So sign the times: many microhouse producers are going after broader sounds (cf Ricardo Villalobos' Alcachofa, Michael Mayer's Touch), bigger hooks (cf Luomo's The Present Lover, Matthew Dear's Leave Luck To Heaven) or, in one impressive recent case, a high-stakes aversion to both hooks and variety (Villalobos' The Au Harem D'Archimede). Losoul's Peter Kremeier has served consistently good, high-and-wide smorgasboard house for years, but upon release much of it fell victim to anachronism. His early 12-inches and 2000 full-length debut Belong were minimal enough to put him under the microhouse tent alongside much of the rest of Germany, but their warm strains of funk and soul undermined a lot of his trendy appeal, casting Losoul as a mere dilletante in the face of the strict clickers on Perlon and Kompakt. Over the past four years, Kremeier's sensibilities haven't changed very much but given the genre's current climate of flirtation with disco and even trance, Losoul's follow-up album Getting Even comes off ironically enough as super-strict, textbook microhouse. Tracks like ""Railrude"", ""Brain Of Glass"", ""Insula"", and ""Matchbox"" are seven- and eight-minute monsters with no hurry or interest in gimmickry. Instead, Losoul squeezes every bit of energy out of his tight loops with the most insignificant of permutations. If anything, Losoul's funk and soul fetish has reconfigured itself into his instrumentation: dubby whiplashes of bass swoop in and out of tracks, and cutesy Fisher-Price piano synth heat Getting Even with nostalgic if not kitschy flickers of color. Vocal tracks have always been hit-or-miss for Losoul, and the ones on Getting Even do nothing to change his track record. The goth-schaffel ""Warrior (Rock)"" grandly stomps with trashy reverb and clogged-artery guitar distortion, but the techy-ditty ""You Know"" sounds boxed, and the drugged out heroin's-back vocals on closer ""Blood Sample"" ruin the song's loop-finding-jazz cool down. Not to spite Losoul's in-a-vacuum persona, but Getting Even's best moments are when he's most trendy: ""Tango Acido"" is italo-disco with a pre-Ritalin attention span and the most melodically charged non-melody I've heard in a while. Metal-house cruncher ""Brain Of Glass"" could have been on the latest Speicher compilation, offering an answer to an old question of mine: What would it sound like if Kraftwerk covered Planet Funk's ""The Switch""? Getting Even is hardly a step back from Belong-- everything here is much tighter, and as a whole the release feels much more focused-- but as mere fancy, I can't help but wonder how Losoul would figure into the current tech-house pantheon had he released Getting Even four years ago and Belong this past September. Both are strong albums, but more suggestively, both are telling of how little ""strong album"" can mean to listeners caught up in the latest trend.","While his compatriots embrace big hooks and broad sounds, Losoul sticks to his track-y microhouse guns on this new release for the acclaimed Playhouse label. Helmet step back into the fray, rubbing elbows with the scores of bands they inspired.

The Fair Store,The Strugglers,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68f5e6ef95969320d88/1:1/w_160/2215de17.jpg,2004-11-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7790-the-fair-store/,DarlaAcuarela,"Certain bands become so emblematic that comparisons to them lose meaning. Radiohead is one sterling example. Fugazi is another. The Beatles, natch. And if you play acoustic, folky music with a sinister edge and don't want to be compared to Will Oldham, your best bet is to shave daily. But drawing bands into constellations of similarity is de rigueur in music reviews, not to mention their most serviceable function for readers who want buying guides rather than insight. What does the conscientious critic do when a band comes along who sounds like a lionized reference point in a meaningful way? To ignore it seems a slight to the reader; to mention it, a slight to the musician. It seems the wisest course is to touch upon the similarity, but not to harp on it. When listening to The Stugglers's new EP, The Fair Store, Palace Music's Viva Last Blues instantly comes to mind: The ominous, spare folk, classic pop-rock traces, and faintly cracking vocals are of a piece with it. And since principal Struggler Randy Bickford doesn't even have a beard, you know I really mean it. But A Fair Store doesn't feel like a Palace facsimile-- Bickford doesn't sing about fucking mountains or anything, although he did contribute a great take on ""Riding"" to Tract's recent Oldham tribute-- it just happens to be tonally congruent. It isn't dificult to understand why simplistic, lo-fi folk that blends modernity and antiquity is popular: It pares music down to a naked, vulnerable state where it'll stand or fall by the smallest gestures of melody, phrasing, and mood. When it doesn't work, it's usually still pleasant, if anonymous. When it does-- as in the hands of Oldham, Sam Beam, John Darnielle, and yes, Bickford-- it's often powerful. In lo-fi folk, a distinctive voice is a must: Bickford's is strong and resonant, richly inflected, exhibiting its range most fully on the mobile melody that snakes over the strummed guitar and wistful pedal steel of ""Goodness Gracious"", and the aching, flaring inflections of the plodding title track. His voice's soft, faltering tendencies balance its steely edge. It attains the precarious ratio of gentleness to rawness that makes a singer memorable. The melodies are winning and straightforward, laced with understated crescendos and tightly controlled flourishes. The clipped guitar and piano of ""Until I Slept"", like most of the EP, manages to be both sweet and bracing. A Fair Store is the most ""produced"" effort we've heard from The Strugglers. Its guitars, drums, piano, and pedal steel are arrayed in tidy procession, but are still played close to the bone. The melody of ""Light Weight"" seems a bit de-fanged; otherwise, the EP is clean but not sterile, and it retains a homegrown appeal. The lyrics are unostentatious and the imagery is stark-- the personal opens up into the universal thanks to Bickford's suggestive, elliptical couplets. In the end, the personal/universal dichotomy is essential. To be effective, the genre sometimes called ""beardfolk"" must be at once specific-- as it's so strongly rooted in personal experience-- and general enough not to abandon folk's long history of palpating the collective and transmitting heritage. It must be old and new at the same time. It's musicians such as Bickford-- pursuing individuality while honoring the greater tradition-- who distinguish themselves from the legion.","Randy Bickford is a beardless Will Oldham type, and on this latest release from The Strugglers, he delicately walks the line between the personal and universal.

Future Perfect,Autolux,by: Peter Macia,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1adea9e61561daa4866/1:1/w_160/c767429c.jpg,2004-11-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/459-future-perfect/,DMZ,"Los Angeles, as we all know and love it, is a fucking cesspool. It's seething with pretty little coke-fed nihilists with shards of hair and vintage fabrics jutting from their dancing skeletons. Skid row after parties are 10 times more populated than the actual shows, and the hordes toast caffeinated vodkas to a vacuous neo-dancepunk set by a B-list celebrity DJ. It's enough to make one want to get the hell out of town, but of course it's difficult to even afford a full tank of gas these days. So instead hitch a ride with fellow Angelenos, Autolux, on their debut Future Perfect. Their optimism is reassuring. In the first 10 seconds of album opener ""Turnstile Blues"", Carla Azar shames most every beatmaker with her ridiculous Leibezeit-cum-Bonham percussion. Azar's sturdy and creative drumming provides the thrust of Greg Edwards' heavily reverbed and distorted riffs. Meanwhile, Eugene Goreshter sings whispery lullabies of escape and alienation, and his rumbling bass rattles the brain. ""So what/ It's alright,"" he sighs, ""They're waiting for you to go."" It's not until ""Sugarless""-- 15 minutes into Future Perfect-- that Autolux veer slightly and strangely away from relentless noise-pop. Like a super-cute HAL9000, Azar's soothing monotone says she's ""over it."" Over what? All of a sudden, Goreshter starts ""whoo-hoo""-ing and we realize we're hurtling toward infinity with a bunch of goddamn lunatics. The middle passage seesaws between swaggering glam and ethereal anxiety. ""Capital Kind Of Strain"" is the ship out of fuel, tumbling aimlessly through the void; ""Asleep at the Trigger"" shuts down the boosters altogether. Surprisingly, the record's production is handled by T-Bone Burnett, soundtrack producer of the Coen Brothers' rustic comedy O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Burnett's laissez-faire style somehow matches as well with Autolux's intense dynamic as it does with Appalachian folk songs. He allows the musicians to speak for themselves-- the only evidence of his existence being the sound of his grumpy ass bumping around the studio in between a few songs. The obvious talking points here are Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine, but the history of the Autolux's band members cannot be overlooked. All three survived late-90s ""alternative rock"", most notably Edwards, who was a member of Failure. That band's Fantastic Planet-- along with the twin moons of Cobain and Corgan-- orbits off in the distance on much of Future Perfect. That said, the album sounds like the work of a band that has been in suspended animation for the past five years, hidden away from the torrent of the new wave revival and the reutn of disco as a viable rock touchstone. Azar, Edwards, and Goreshter now emerge from their slumber, preserved and prepared, ready to scorch the earth with their afterburn.","L.A. space-rock hopefuls Autolux sign to the Coen Brothers' DMZ label and enlist producer T-Bone Burnett to ground their galactic ambitions.

Greatest Hits,Neil Young,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c8ea9e61561daa4640/1:1/w_160/ea4fdb61.jpg,2004-11-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8854-greatest-hits/,Reprise,"Neil Young is the kind of man that appreciates albums in the traditional sense: cohesive beginning-to-end statements, occasionally thematic if the mood suits him, and preferably experienced through big speakers on crackly old vinyl. His resistance to digital music has been well-documented, and until recently, several of his releases-- including 1974's classic On the Beach-- had never been made available on compact disc. So one can imagine him in an A&R; office upstairs at Reprise Records, year after year, continually shooting down the concept of a compilation that attempts to condense his entire history onto a single disc. He's already been compiled once anyway-- with the 1977 3xLP retrospective Decade. Regardless, we're now being offered Greatest Hits, although Young does seems begrudging: Its only liner notes are the obligatory song credits and one line from Young himself that simply states, ""Greatest hits inclusion based on original record sales, airplay, and known download history."" These criteria are not only anathema to his aesthetic (since when does the man behind ""This Note's For You"" care about airplay?), but here they comprise a collection that only skims the surface of his catalog: The tracklist features 16 songs from his 35-year career, ranging from 1969's ""Down by the River"" to 1991's ""Harvest Moon"". Young's stubborn integrity extends beyond his politics-- which inform all of his songs, but only define a few like ""Ohio"" and ""Rockin' in the Free World""-- and saturates his music. His catalog is riddled with sharp contrasts and sly contradictions, not least of which is the fact that this bearish-looking man sings with such a fragile falsetto. More crucially, Young moves from ragged guitar epics to jangly country ballads with impressive agility. He's also not one to rein in his songs, so they may often run for only two intense minutes (""The Needle and the Damage Done"") or sprawl to upwards of nine (""Down by the River"", ""Cowgirl in the Sand""). These extremes make for a strange and strangely compelling Greatest Hits. Conceptually, it shouldn't work: Young has played many roles over five decades, but indeed, he's never been a singles artist. In fact, he has only a passing acquaintance with the pop singles chart-- ""Heart of Gold"" went to #1, but he's had only two other solo top 40 singles-- and many of his most popular songs run much longer than the typical single's three minutes. The disc begins, perversely and brilliantly, with the one-two punch of ""Down By the River"" and ""Cowgirl in the Sand"", which together total almost 20 minutes. This seems less an act of rebellion than a simple stroke of luck, as the compilation is sequenced chronologically. Even so, the songs illustrate clearly that Young and the hits format aren't exactly perfect for each other, while still constituting an impressive introduction for newcomers. Which is precisely what this record is designed to do. Greatest Hits is obviously intended mostly for curious initiates or casual listeners (although the remastered tracks will likely attract hardcore Young fans, too), and it achieves its goals sufficiently. Those unacquainted with his work will learn that Young was a tremendous guitar player who gave himself ample room to range; that Crazy Horse understood the need to provide a good backdrop for his solos and knew how to churn a drag-the-river momentum; that Young was an able songwriter who could craft a killer line like ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" clincher ""every junkie's like a setting sun."" What they won't learn is the difference between Young's work with Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills & Nash: All 16 tracks are presented as Young's solo work, which is misleading. Historical liner notes could have cleared this up and even introduced Young's collaborators. Instead, the package leaves it to listeners to infer these distinctions from the song credits. Fittingly, Greatest Hits skews to Young's early material: Eleven of these tracks represent his 1969-71 output, and only two songs postdate the 1970s (and, therefore, the still-in-print, two-disc Decade). The implication is that Young more or less faded away, and that his first few albums far outshine his subsequent material. But such a view is surely reductive: Young has not only been actively releasing albums throughout the 90s and into the 00s, but several of them been unexpectedly solid as well. The sadly missed ""Cortez the Killer"" and ""Tonight's the Night"" are the set's most obvious exclusions, but the dismissal of late-era tracks like ""This Note's for You"", ""Fuckin' Up"", or even ""From Hank to Hendrix"" is unfortunate, too. Of course, it's all too easy to nitpick any greatest-hits tracklist-- any of them could be said to carry grievous omissions or curious inclusions. On one hand, this type of cursory overview isn't supposed to give us a detailed portrait of the artist, only a general sketch; on the other, Young is too complex a musician to be adequately represented by a mere 16 songs. The music on Greatest Hits holds up undeniably well, but the concept itself-- perhaps inevitably-- falters, failing to capture the essence of one of rock's sturdiest and most ragged voices.",,8.0,
Nice: Splittin' Peaches EP,Oneida,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9dbc0084474cd0c26e1/1:1/w_160/6d8834eb.jpg,2004-11-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6000-nice-splittin-peaches-ep/,Ace Fu,"It hasn't always been easy to navigate the wondrous and befuddling trail that Brooklyn's Oneida have cut through the dense psych-rock underbrush. Though the group has steadily refined its thunderous sound, its path has also been peppered with so many digressions and departures that just when you think you've found the main road you realize the band has actually led you straight into the goddamn quicksand. In fact, you might have to look back to late-80s vintage Butthole Surfers to find a band that so precariously balanced its art-rock ambitions with an unabashed and irreverent love for monolithic, sometimes psychedelic 70s heavy rock riffage. Like the Buttholes in their prime, Oneida maintain a relentless recording schedule, throwing new material into the marketplace quickly-- often without waiting until it's gathered into album-sized portions. On that tip they've now presented us with yet another EP, the strangely (but aptly?) titled Nice: Splittin' Peaches. At the beginning of the year-- when Oneida delivered their 6th album, Secret Wars-- it seemed that songs like ""$50 Tea"" or the epic ""Changes in the City"" brought their affinity for pummeling, repetitive psych-rock riffs to a logical and ecstatic conclusion, leaving it difficult to guess how the group might continue on without backtracking. Thankfully, on these four songs Oneida broaden their vistas and move in enticing new directions. The big-ticket item is the stupefying 14-minute extravaganza ""Hakuna Matata"". Now, I'm pleased to admit that I've never seen one frame of Disney's The Lion King, but I have unfortunately been exposed to its soundtrack. So while I can't claim to be an expert, I feel pretty confident this track shares nothing in common with the Elton John/Tim Rice-penned anthem besides its title, a sprightly tempo, and perhaps a certain esprit de corps. Although Oneida have produced ambitious trance-rock marathons in the past-- tracks as ""Sheets of Easter"" from 2002's Each One Teach One-- they've always placed just as much emphasis on the rock as on the trance. But on ""Hakuna Matata"" the group travels beyond rock: disembodied voices hover around drummer Kid Millions' unyielding hypnotic pulse and snaky rattles. Despite its length, the track seems to melt by in an eyeblink. The EP's other three songs are much shorter and less audacious, though certainly not without their moments. The Beefheartian ""Summerland"" is enlivened by some scalding saxophone courtesy of veteran William Parker collaborator and Gold Sparkle Band member Charles Waters. ""Inside My Head"" is Oneida at their catchiest, featuring some outlandishly flabby tones from Bobby Matador's organ as well as what are surely some of the year's most believable lyrics (""It's all fucked up now/ Living inside my head""). The extremely brief ""Song Y"" pleasantly blends falsetto vocals and acoustic guitar with percolating keyboards, blowing out a couple square-shaped bubbles that, although pretty, are likely unfit for long-term survival. About the only question left unanswered is whether or not the highlights of Nice: Splittin' Peaches are an indication of further treats to come or if they've once again duped us down a blind alley. Either way, I'm looking forward to Oneida's next move.","It hasn't always been easy to navigate the wondrous and befuddling trail that Brooklyn's Oneida have cut through ...

Must Die,Dwarves,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba4413d197565213b041/1:1/w_160/9fc06b7d.jpg,2004-11-28 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2498-must-die/,Sympathy for the Record Industry,"Irony is dead, the punditocracy twittered a few years back. I always thought that was bogus, particularly as the idea of emotionally honest music devolved into a marketing pose called ""emo."" Hell, just last week soon-to-be-erstwhile Secretary of State Colin Powell said the Bush Administration would refuse to recognize the closely contested electoral victor in Ukraine. But if shock-savoring joke-punk group Dwarves' latest album is any bellwether, perhaps all those The New York Times Op-Ed writers and cable-news talking hairdos were onto something after all. Back when Dwarves ruled the earth (or at least the stoned free time of certain Circle Jerks-worshipping Blockbuster clerks), the joke was on any square who took them seriously. Dwarves' kinky brand of hardcore punk was as funny as it was offensive. ""Old enough to pee, then she's old enough for me,"" barked frontman Blag Dahlia on ""Let's Fuck"" from the band's 1990 master (masturbatory?) stroke, Blood Guts & Pussy. But then 2000's buttfuck-by-numbers Come Clean marked a clear softening from hilarious stupidity to stupid stupidity. This time the joke's on Dwarves. The sad thing is they don't even seem to realize it (more on that later). I wish the problem were just that their shock value had worn off, although it has. Little person on a crucifix and three naked chicks? Please, we've lived through Marilyn Manson and Simple Life 2. ""Fuck Eat and Fuck You Up"" has a momentarily amusing title, but who really wants to listen to White Zombie verses and Smashmouth choruses? One of the few traditional hardcore tracks-- ""Dominator"", recycled from last year's The L.A. Shakedown compilation-- steals a metaphor from ""California Love"": ""You can't touch me/ I'm Elliot Ness."" Washed-up perv-rockers ripping off 2Pac and Dre isn't funny; it's pathetic and derivative, much like the cookie-cutter pop-punk of single ""Salt Lake City"", which features The Offspring's Dexter Holland. If there's any gleeful evil left in guitarist HeWhoCanNotBeNamed, he's wishing he could reprise the hoax of his own death that got the band canned from Sub Pop. It's tough when you pick on targets half your size and you're Dwarves. The aforementioned ""Salt Lake City"" calls out the Osmonds for their lameness. Thank you, Captain Obvious. ""Massacre""-- one of a few misguided excursions into lobotomized rap-rock-- similarly disses sucka MCs like ""Bad"" Charlotte, ""Queens of the Trust Fund"", MTV, and Creed. Wait, Scott Stapp sucks now? Shit, I thought he rocked ""God Bless America"" during the World Series! ""Runaway #2"", is a bit stronger, infusing classic Ramones punk with (what else?) lyrics about Oedipal hospital bathroom fellatio. And admirers of quasi-Gregorian chants, Beastie Boy scratching and post-Downward Spiral Nine Inch Nails will soil their bloody briefs for ""Christ on a Mic"". It's ambitious, but then so is jihad. Come to think of it, maybe Dwarves should write a song about what they'd do with 10,000 virgins, or any other topic that might make them something close to relevant in 2004. A THC-addled voice mumbles deep in my subconscious: ""Whoa, but man, what if, like, that's why the album is brilliant? Sure, it seems like idiocy upon idiocy, but what if that's the intentional construct of punk-rock demigods working on Another Level? After all, former Dwarves member and current Queen of the Stone Age Nick Oliveri appears on the record, too..."" In that case the album might be ironic, after all, but so what?

Why did ""Pole"" have to retire his vinyl-mastering machine? It had so much poetry. The harmonies of a stylus bludgeoning vinyl surfaces to death as narcotic dub basslines and guitar jangles trudge through the hallways of an ex-Eastern Bloc housing project-- that was all virgin territory back in '99. Most of the earliest artists on Betke's ~scape label seemed to extend our man's glitches-- including Kit Clayton's ectoplasmic subterranean-dub and Jan Jelinek's loops, which robotized soul-jazz records. ""Glitches"" are barely heard on But Then Again, ~scape's fifth-anniversary release. That's because the album collects work from the label's current roster, a group that now focus on contorting rhythms and harmonies into new, yet rather familiar shapes. Given ~scape's feted advancements of yore, few risks are taken here, but But Then Again still entertains. Opener, Cappablack's ""5th Dimension (Anti-imperialism Disco)"" shoves the listener against the wall with its sample of a lady shouting about her inability to solve a math problem. A post-Neptunes crunk beat follows as their rapper struggles to teach astrophysics. What this has to do with ""anti-imperialism"" is up to you. Bus & Dabrye's ""What Is Paris?"" is better rooted in b-boy culture thanks to its electro-funk moogs and stubbed-toe beats that sound like a hungover Kraftwerk. John Tejada's ""And Many More"" is a curious microhouse ballad that laments over Nintendo GameBoy melodies-- ultimately evoking the experience of staring at tombstone apartments at dusk. The artists who say the most with the slightest gestures create But Then Again's highlights. Jan Jelinek's ""Western Mimikry"" brilliantly dangles a loop of a sleepwalking jazz-guitar riff in the breeze. Andrew Pekler's ""Unidentified"" is fine, absthine-jazz that flickers obtuse rhythms-- as if Teo Macero produced Miles Davs in 2072. And then there is Mike Shannon's ""Remembrance"" which lets a geothermal dub rhythm find its way in the dark, while guest chanteuse June scolds, ""You promised heaven far, far away!"" The record's mid-lights are civil and pay their taxes. In ""We Like It Slow and Steady"", Deadbeat remixes his older dub thunderclaps into R&B; that encircles a streetlight. System's ""Hu Ra!!"" clicky-clacks to a toy solider cadence with a melodica and clarinet duet frowning at the world. Headset & Soulo's ""The Fall of Knee High"" scores a few brownie points for its Tom Waits-mused, chain-gang beats and squealing harmonicas. Let's just hope that ~scape doesn't see gold mines in the AOR-dub of Triola's ""Neuland"" and the Starbucks-friendly, lite-jazz of Epo's ""Doorstep"", on which their frontwoman sings ""sweet, sweet cherry pie"" in an herbal tea-watered croon. Hey, wait a minute. Where did Pole go? Mr. Betke didn't even show up at his own party. But then again, maybe it's best to leave broken machines alone.","Stefan Betke (Pole)'s Berlin-based dub/nu-jazz/leftfield label ~scape celebrates its fifth anniversary by ignoring the past and focusing only on the present. Dwarves return to slay some sacred cows. Ooh, take that Scott Stapp!

Cockahoop,Cerys Matthews,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c52feb335119a49ed94d/1:1/w_160/fcd7a3f2.jpg,2004-11-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5619-cockahoop/,Blanco y NegroBlanco y Negro,"Either the songs on former Catatonia frontwoman Cerys Matthews' first solo effort, Cockahoop, were recorded in tracklist order, or this album is a triumph of sequencing. It begins tentatively with ""Chardonnay"", an unrecorded ode to white wine by Nashville songwriter Roger Cook; gradually becomes more confident over the first half; hits its stride just before the instrumental interlude; peaks over three songs; and ends on a hopeful note with an arrangement of the traditional ""All My Trials"". Perhaps this progression wouldn't be so noteworthy-- or even as noticeable-- if it were assembled by any other artist. But Cockahoop is Matthews' first recorded work since Catatonia's lackluster final album, Paper Scissors Stone, which followed her stint in rehab and preceded the band's dissolution in 2001. After some time off, Matthews decamped to Nashville to work with producer and lap steel player Bucky Baxter, who helped corral an impressive roster of local country music veterans like pedal steel player Lloyd Green, former Notorious Cherry Bomb Richard Bennett, and bassist Dave Pomeroy, as well as former Wilco drummer Ken Coomer and Old Crow Medicine Show banjoist Ketcham Secor. The result is certainly influenced by Nashville country, but like some sort of exchange student program, it also incorporates British elements, including bazouki and bass flute. Lending to the international vibe, Matthews sings ""La Bague"" in French and the traditional hymn ""Arglwydd Dyma Fi"" in her native Welsh. Cockahoop dynamically reflects Matthews' re-immersion into music. The first half (before the intermission) sounds like she's dipping her toe in the water, easing into the sessions not timidly, but warily, as if disappointment looms. ""Chardonnay"" is a brave choice to kick off a post-rehab album, and ""Caught in the Middle"" and ""Louisiana"" are low-key excursions on which Matthews sounds like she's holding back vocally. Her delivery is whispery and subdued compared to her powerhouse vocals on Catatonia songs like ""Road Rage"" and ""Apple Core."" She sounds vulnerable here-- battered a bit by life, but still wide-eyed and hopeful. By the second half, starting with ""Arglwydd Dyma Fi"", her vocals have grown bolder and much more confident-- she sings ""If You're Lookin' for Love"" like a giddy come-on, even cracking up on the second verse as Baxter adds banjolele, bass harp, dobro, and saxophone. The rafter-raising ""The Good in Good-Bye"" features a fuller sound and a brassy performance that owes more to Nashville legends like Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn than to anything Catatonia recorded. The only dud comes with the Handsome Family cover ""Weightless Again"". Singing Rennie Sparks' lines, Matthews pretends to know the answer to ""Why people O.D. on pills/ And jump from the Golden Gate Bridge."" It is, of course, ""to feel weightless again."" But Cockahoop sounds best when Matthews doesn't pretend to have the answers, as on the closer ""All My Trials,"" where she calmly accepts that ""all my trials, lord, will soon be over.""","Former Catatonia frontwoman emerges from the ruins of her old band with this strong solo debut. Originally released on Blanco y Negro in '03, but recently revived by Rough Trade.

The Downward Spiral [Deluxe Edition],Nine Inch Nails,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c402ea9e61561daa8057/1:1/w_160/a65a9e36.jpg,2004-11-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5802-the-downward-spiral-deluxe-edition/,InterscopeNothingInterscopeNothing,"You may have noticed that we here at Pitchfork HQ occasionally get excited about what we perceive to be the next new sound, be it in the form of an individual band or an entire newfangled genre. I myself am not above such occasional ballyhoo, most recently biting the hook hard on recently fashionable hyphenated mergers of electronics and rock, be it dance-punk or lap-pop or lance-ponk. I was completely convinced (and still am, to some extent) that guitars and computers were on the verge of ending their long, heated standoff, and that they would start making the hip new music of the future. Well, among the many public services of the reissue is to remind us that there is usually nothing new under the musical sun, and so now, here's a 10th anniversary edition of The Downward Spiral to remind me that The Postal Service are just NIN in a better mood. When the album was first released, I wasn't concerned with any technological achievements Trent Reznor may have been conjuring-- I was too distracted by his concepts of fucking like animals, god being dead (and no one caring), and I am a big man yesIam. Sure, NIN might have provided a perfect dose of loud guitars and screaming to score my melodramatic years, but what most drew me to collect Halos was the atmosphere: fake snuff film videos, drummer microphone injuries, the Sharon Tate murder house, and lyrical self-mutilation that made Cobain sound like Vedder. Now that I'm old, boring, and presumably less susceptible to the trappings of angst, it's possible to peel back that surface layer of fishnet and makeup and take a peek at the music underneath. And surprisingly, for music built on what I'm sure was cutting edge audio technology of the early 90s, The Downward Spiral sounds only the slightest bit aged, and not too far flung from the aggro-beats that still rule alt-rock formats. I'd even go so far as to affix Reznor with the cliché label ""ahead of his time,"" despite the decade's worth of Wax Trax! 12-inches that surely influenced him. Still, even with all that precedent, Reznor must've done something to usher industrial music into the mainstream. My best guess is that Nine Inch Nails hit upon just the right amount of dance music content to gloss up his dire tunes without scaring off the homophobes. Reznor's dance leanings are constantly bubbling just under the surface of The Downward Spiral, and it nearly goes without saying that the breakout hit, ""Closer"", leaned a bit more obviously in that direction than most of the rest of the album. Easily the record's sexiest song and slinkiest beat, its disco thump still sounds markedly current. Meanwhile, ""Heresy"", for all its Nietzsche-inspired deicide, is a couple clicks of the distortion dial away from being a Depeche Mode song. And don't forget, ""March of the Pigs"" beat ""Firestarter"" to the digital hardcore punch by three years. The B-side-filled second disc of this reissue assists this hindsight. Reznor was always fond of emphasizing clubby rhythms rather than tortured screams on his many, many self-remixes. I've always preferred ""Piggy (Nothing Can Stop Me Now)"" from the excellent Further Down the Spiral EP to the album version. The remix replaced the original's jazzy sparseness with a graveyard of broken breakbeats. ""Closer to God"" and ""All the Pigs, All Lined Up"" confirm two of my above appraisals of Downward Spiral album tracks. And for fuck's sake, there's even a cover of Soft Cell's ""Memorabilia"" to balance out the much-too-easy goth karaoke of ""Dead Souls"", the set's other homage. Of course, The Downward Spiral wasn't just opening my early-teen eyes to the wonders of blasphemy and extended remixes, but also to the joy of the concept album-- in coordination with Melon Collie & the Infinite Sadness, 1994/5 was a bumper crop for thematic excess. Reznor might've gone off the art-rock deep end with The Fragile, an album I have absolutely no recollection of whatsoever, but The Downward Spiral still holds together, aided by a few musical reprises and its monochromatic lyrical content. Reznor had his album dynamics down pat at the time, chasing the brutal Gaspar Noe rape of ""Big Man with a Gun"" with ""A Warm Place"", the closest thing a teenager got to Eno in that era. Even the much-overrated ""Hurt"", which I didn't even like in the hands of a dying country singer, is a suitable post-storm calm. That Reznor's chainsaw guitars haven't dulled after a decade of Stabbing Filter Manson knockoffs is gratifying, and that they still cut glass-- remastering or no-- is a credit to his production skills. With the benefit of Dolby 5.1 and SACD somethingorother, I'm sure the scream typhoons of ""The Becoming"" and the sedimentary synth layers of ""Eraser"" sound delightful on stereos I can't afford; (Best Buy wouldn't let me blast ""Ruiner"" in the demo room.) But even in obsolete stereophonic, the peekaboo drums of ""Piggy"" and the oscillating broken piano of ""Closer"" still impress. Which is why it's a shame Reznor has largely been in seclusion since The Fragile shattered on impact. Since then, he's only emerged to restart old feuds and produce a terrible Zach de la Rocha single. Even if his songwriting talents flamed out after The Downward Spiral's extreme catharsis (how do you out-dread ""I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel?""), why has he been so selfish with his talents behind the board? While NIN remains in limbo, watered-down versions pollute the airwaves, hysterical critics forget that electronics and rock have met before, and only the occasional anniversary reissue reminds them that a Pennsylvania goth with a bad haircut was on to something underneath all the provocation.","Interscope takes further advantage of the holiday shopping blowout with this deluxe edition of yet another 90s alt-rock staple. Here's Trent Reznor's best-known (and most highly regarded) work, The Downward Spiral, bulked up to include Dolby 5.1 surround and SACD mixes, and an entire second disc's worth of B-sides, remixes and rarities.

Kasabian,Kasabian,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3eabf31b7dc7155c91/1:1/w_160/9201187c.jpg,2004-11-23 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4588-kasabian/,RCABMG,"Domestic badasses are usually pretty one-dimensional. From the musclebound Joe Weider plank snapper to the wizened loose-cannon drunk or the free-swinging pro athlete, they're just different versions of the same uninteresting dolt. That's why English louts often seen more interesting to us Americans than our homegrown ones. Buoyed by football, illicit drugs, and lager-- or the remnants of mid-90s lad culture in general-- these types often take an elemental approach to bad behavior. They integrate torrents of entertaining drunk speak into fistfights both won and lost; they're boastful, prideful, or just plain full. They're going to live fast and die young, but not until after the kebab shops close. Kasabian is the latest UK outfit to tap into this bravado conduit, and as they've shown over singles ranging back to the beginning of 2004 (all of which appear on this self-titled debut LP), the Leicester combo likes their hedonism a la carte. ""Processed Beats"" apes shamelessly the shambolic beat and double-tracked lead vocals of vintage Stone Roses, ""L.S.F. [Lost Souls Forever]"" is a sly and seamy ride through the hybridist sonic absurdism of Lo Fidelity Allstars, and ""Butcher Blues"" is another version of Swinging London revisionism with its hazy dissolves, tube station announcement vocals, and head-nodding electronic percussion. Each of these songs possess that certain kinetic fizz that makes a great single. The strutting Mani-istic bass of ""Processed"", ""L.S.F.""'s handclaps, hip-hop breaks, and soaring chorus (""Come on! We got our backs to the wall!"")-- in its best moments, Kasabian is the soundtrack to the slow-motion Guy Ritchie movie inside every lad's head. That quality makes ""Club Foot""'s tensely barbed guitar perfect for punching faces to. And yet, its initial rush dissipates. Like the harsh house lights of the pub at closing time, the groove can't go on forever-- especially when it eventually starts to morph into every Primal Scream song you've ever heard. That's where Kasabian begins to waver. It's a catchy and energizing Friday evening record that draws from its sources well, but seems to have had some staying power sapped by the spliffs. It drags in places and sags in others. ""U Boat"" tries for layered organic and electronic bliss but drifts distractedly into a wispy Beta Band mess. ""I.D."" doesn't go anywhere we haven't been before, either. Once its thumping beat and lilting synthesizer surge has transported us back to the Hacienda, Kasabian fades in favor of some old Happy Mondays records. Kasabian is brash, loutish, and seems liable at times to cut you; the consistent kick drum beat throughout it is like a great party's heartbeat. But like the roustabout in the corner, drinking all the lager and scratching up your old records, it can be more loudmouthed than substantial.","Domestic badasses are usually pretty one-dimensional.

Everyone Is Here,The Finn Brothers,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beaaea9e61561daa7928/1:1/w_160/8a3d6a60.jpg,2004-11-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3330-everyone-is-here/,Nettwerk,"Though the elegant return of pop-savant sibling duo Neil and Tim Finn arrived in August, Everyone Is Here isn't a summer record. Beneath super-slick production by Mitchell Froom (along with toast-of-Hollywood Jon Brion and Bowie/T. Rex knob-twiddler Tony Visconti) and the Down Under brothers' usual surging melodies, a barely disguised melancholy broods like an evil Finn twin chained up in the basement. The Finns' latest is glossy, emotional, and sure to satisfy longtime listeners-- as well as any Stereophonics or Aqualung fans paying their respects. Tim, the elder Finn, was the first to come to international prominence, fronting clownishly costumed new-wavers Split Enz. Little brother Neil joined up on guitar prior to 1977's Dizrhythmia, and in 1979 his composition ""I Got You"" became the band's breakthrough hit. After garnering MTV airtime with videos like ""Six Months in a Leaky Boat"", the group folded in the mid-1980s. Tim pursued a solo career, while Neil went on to lead Crowded House, whose ""Don't Dream It's Over"" remains as brilliant as it is inoffensive (I'm pretty sure I heard it at a dentist's office once while getting a tooth filled, but I still put it on mix CDs). The brothers reunited for Crowded House's 1991 Woodface, which still stands as their collaborative high watermark; their first album as The Finn Brothers, 1995's Finn, was an exotic, eclectic affair. While not on par with that mid-90s LP, Everyone Is Here combines the skillfully crafted pop effervescence of Woodface and the moodiness of Finn. Opener and first single ""Won't Give In"" is a catchy bit of lite-rock, introducing the gorgeous brotherly harmonies that recur throughout the record. But it also includes lines like ""We all have to die alone"". The song, with its ""Everyone I love is here"" chorus, is both a celebration of life and a middle-age awareness of death's nearness. The Finns' mother died not long before the album's release, and a sense of mortality occasionally manages to leak through Froom's pristine production, lavish strings and all. The sadness floats to the top on ""Edible Flowers"", a mawkish piano ballad that some will surely love. ""Everybody wants the same thing,"" the brothers sing, ""to see another birthday."" Sure, that and an iPod. But the typically swooning chorus, while a touch easy-listening, is lush enough that it renders the sad-eyed lyrics superfluous. The bouncy, overproduced ""Homesick"" could be an anthem for disaffected progressives unable to secure Canadian residency (""Homesick for the country that I'm living in""), but it's really another example of the pathos lurking below the band's popcraft. Closer ""Gentle Hum"" provides four and a half minutes of calm, almost-meditative reflection apropos of the track's name. Not everything here is as seamless as the brothers' interlocking voices. ""All God's Children"" starts off with a fit of garage-y guitar downstrokes (you know, like that one Strokes song) and then engages in a possibly tongue-in-cheek discussion of theogony worthy of Kevin Smith's self-importantly silly Dogma. The bright, earnest ""Anything Can Happen"" is hook-filled enough to be a single, but it and the subsequent love song ""Luckiest Man Alive"" rarely go past the cliches of their refrains (much like Mick Jagger's new ""Old Habits Die Hard""). You'd think lifelong songwriters would be able to come up with titles that hadn't already been used by Air Supply, in Jagger's case, and World In Motion-era Jackson Browne, for the Finns. The album is at its best when the brothers' knack for pop melodies meets subject matter that is poignant, not maudlin or even merely sufficient. ""Disembodied Voices"" fulfills this album's promise, reminiscing about brotherhood, childhood, and harmony. That's what Everyone Is Here is really about. Again, from the opener: ""Everyone I love is here/ Play it once, then we disappear."" Darkness might be gathering somewhere, but loved ones can always gather together and raise their voices above the din to achieve a brief, transitory, but undeniable peace. Even if that means sounding like late-period Wings.","Former Crowded House and Split Enz stars Neil and Tim Finn team up for a record of moody well-crafted guitar pop. This Leicester, England-based lad-rock outfit is one part Primal Scream and one part Lo Fidelity Allstars. In each case, it's the bad part.

Wandering Stranger,Entrance,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf85e6ef95969322f70/1:1/w_160/4a6a6bf6.jpg,2004-11-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2911-wandering-stranger/,Fat Possum,"You know the tale: White boys snuck away with the blues, hollowed it out with shrill teeny-bopper mania and a vaguely emergent counter-culture, and created the shiny, deltaless gleam of rock. And yet, over the past few years, there has been increased interest in the blues-- mostly from white midwesterners who were introduced to it via Jimmy Page and Keith Richards. Of these new blues fetishistis, The White Stripes are the success story and The Black Keys are riding shotgun. Another Fat Possum artist, Guy Blakeslee-- the lightning-haired hippie-throwback from Entrance-- is also helping to reform a genre that has largely been forsaken since Page and Richards were clean. After tours with Devendra Banhart and Cat Power, Blakeslee began to make a small underground clamor in 2003 with his Honey Moan EP. That disc showed potential, but Blakeslee has quickly blossomed. Using a peculiar guitar style-- he flips a right-handed guitar and plays it with his left-- Blakeslee creates a sound with enough feverish cacophony to raise Robert Johnson from his eternal deal. His second LP as Entrance, Wandering Stranger, picks up on the gutty Leadbelly-era moans of his first, tracing the eternal welcome in age-old standards while creating novel originals steeped in the form's history. ""Rex's Blues"" is the re-telling of a song by cult country-rock troubadour Townes Van Zandt. Blakeslee's straight depression-era accompaniment-- from slow guitar-picking to a moaning, despondent fiddle-- makes the track sound like a camp-fire hymn crumpled under the faded lore of histories and proclamations that ""the South will rise again"". His voice is a high-pitched moan/beg that aches with a sense of dusty misfortune, and is reminiscent of the husky country-folk voacls of Van Zandt contemporary Ry Cooder. As his voice gives way to a rumbling piano, Blakeslee confesses a historic allegiance to the blues but, more importantly, makes them seethe again. On the title track, Blakeslee asks his production crew to dim the lights, setting an appropriate mood for the blistering acoustic blues jam that follows. ""Wandering Stranger"" begins with a simple guitar roll before gaining steam and storming through mournful tambourine hits and Elmore James production. Though it spends a bit too much time repeating its titular phrase, Blakeslee manages to hold your attention with his hypnotic guitar picking and vagabond desperation. At times, Blakeslee mixes the experimental leanings of the Velvet Underground and Tim Buckley into his country-blues, and he does so to mesmerizing effect. ""Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor"" has the same sort of claustrophobic beauty heard on Starsailor or Astral Weeks. Borrowing Buckley's airy, off-key vocals and rumbling spitfire guitar strokes, Blakeslee-- frayed and torn by the sterility of modernity-- perfects the drunken torch song. ""Please Be Careful in New Orleans"" tracks the same dwindling night. Pulsing with release and forlorn grace, its swampy, lovelorn quality contributes as much to the blues as it borrows. Ending with the weathered river-bent jam ""Happy Trails"", Blakeslee closes an album that should delight blues purists and neo-delta enthusiasts alike. His unconventional stylings meld into the time-honored necessities of repetition and stark resurgence with a grace that belies his 23 years.","Fat Possum neo-bluesman and former Devendra Banhart tourmate Entrance picks up where his 2003 EP Honey Moan left off.

Virðulegu forsetar,Jóhann Jóhannsson,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0e5e6ef95969322af1/1:1/w_160/0af8754c.gif,2004-11-23 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4275-virulegu-forsetar/,Touch,"Listening to music by Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson reminds me of optical illusions, those little diagrams where you can't believe this line is really the same length as that line, or you're amazed that the swirling circle isn't really rotating. Our brains are complex computers but it doesn't take much to short the circuits. We're constantly constructing patterns based on context. Virðulegu forsetar is a long piece in four parts that depends heavily on juxtaposition. Over the course of an hour it continues to repeat a single phrase on trumpets, french horns, and tubas. Though simple, it's a bold little cluster of notes with an inherent grandeur, and the brassiest voicing early in the piece suggests a fanfare before a great announcement. But Jóhannsson invests the refrain with a host of different meanings by slowing it down, shifting the pitch, putting it beside all sorts of interesting drones, and making it disappear completely for minutes on end. Over its length the piece undergoes remarkable shifts in mood and feel, which is even more notable considering the basic instrumentation (in addition to the brass, it's scored for organs, piano, bass, glockenspiel, and subtle electronics) is the same throughout. So Virðulegu forsetar is about minimalism and repetition, obviously, but it's also one of the most patient records I've heard. Where last year's equally great Englabörn album consisted of chamber pieces at pop-song length, Virðulegu forsetar should be taken in all at once and in a proper way. Listen to it loud and the organ/electronic rumble connecting the melodic bits comes alive, with odd bits of noise perfectly mucking up the pristinely deep bass pedals. The held tones become vitally important as the piece progresses and the primary motif slows to a crawl; with more space between the notes the connecting drone that stretches to infinity becomes the focus. The horns are always around the corner. At times they're wounded and barely able to sound, but they're always there. Toward the end there's a stretch of silence almost two minutes long before one last gasp of the opening theme carries the piece out on an exhausted note. This gorgeous package contains a DVD audio disc with a 5.1 surround sound mix that attempts to replicate the feel of the original performance (I don't have the technology to hear it, unfortunately). Virðulegu forsetar was first performed in 2003 at Hallgrimskirkja, a large cathedral in Reykjavik, and the album was recorded in the same space. During that first performance, players were positioned on all sides of the audience; it was spring in Iceland which meant a show starting around 11:00 p.m. would finish as the sun was setting. As a visual accompaniment, Jóhannsson filled the cathedral with helium balloons that were slightly underinflated, so that over the course of the piece they fell extremely slowly into the crowd. Think for a moment what a fantastically beautiful image this is. And yet, there's nothing to it. An epic space, sure, but beyond that we're talking balloons, horns, and a keyboard. Careful gestures, simple tools, and a good mind are all Jóhannsson needs. This is the way to live.","Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson returns in the wake of last year's beautiful Englabörn, attempting something altogether ...

Love Angel Music Baby,Gwen Stefani,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68e9d034d5c69bf357b/1:1/w_160/0bf98019.jpg,2004-11-23 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7789-love-angel-music-baby/,Interscope,"Gwen Stefani should stick to making bum flaps. Not quite a skirt, not quite a dish rag, the Stefani bum flap dangles off the guts of our divorced aunts and 12-year-old mall-slut daughters, the ones who steal Livestrong bracelets and dry-hump public schoolkids in Pac Sun dressing rooms. Bum flaps are these people's stars and stripes. Not all of us want to salute this flag, but it exists, and it gives America something else to believe in-- and it's not nearly as expensive as a valium addiction or Kaplan SAT course. As widely predicted, 35-year old singer/fashionista Stefani has temporarily given up No Doubt to fully embrace a high-pop lifestyle with nary a pierced tongue in-cheek. The metamorphosis began with her Eve and Dr. Dre collaboration on 2001's killer single ""Let Me Blow Ya Mind"", and is completed here with her solo debut Love Angel Music Baby, a spineless, starfucked advertisement for her high-end clothing line. Obviously, we can't expect 12 more cuts as personal or urgent as debut single ""What You Waiting For"", Stefani's slick self-steeling kick in the pitch-corrected plaids, and one of the best electro songs this year-- especially when the pop star openly PRs that she didn't ""really see [LAMB] as a 'solo' record in the typical sense... The idea was to be open and let my ego shut up and sit over in the corner and make something great based on a concept."" If Stefani wants to sacrifice her identity, that's fine, but hot Christ, she's working with everyone from Andre 3000 to the Neptunes to New Order to Dr. Dre here. So why isn't LAMB bigger, better, faster, more? Is it the scourge of 4 Non Blondes' Linda Perry, who coaxed Stefani into finishing the solo project and all but forced her back into the studio because Perry reportedly only ""had a brief window of time available""? What's going on? In fairness, one of the Andre tracks, ""Bubble Pop Electric"", isn't half-bad, a brave Prince-goes-Stray Cats doowop shuffle with a great hook and an Andre-as-Johnny Vulture gentleman boyfriend cameo. The track is silly and fun, and probably exactly what Stefani et al., wanted out of LAMB. Which is what makes Andre's second contribution, ""Long Way to Go"", so perplexing: The maudlin MLK Jr. samples and the duet's pointed appeal to interracial dating (""We've got a long way to go!/ It's beyond Martin Luthur/ Upgrade computer"") feel out of place on an otherwise carefree album boasting lines like, ""You know you are my treasure chest,"" and, ""We got hydroponic love/ And we smoke it."" And another thing about Stefani's treasure chests-- not to mention, ""We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top""; the Eve- and Dre- and Tevye-powered camp-hop ""Rich Girl""; ""I only want to fly first class desires (you're my limousine)""; ""We're luxurious like Egyptian cotton""; ""If I was a wealthy girl/ I'd get me four Harajuku girls to inspire me""; the unintentionally offensive orientalist fetishism, ""Now we get to lay back""; ""Ch-Ching Ch-Ching-- we're loaded and we're not going to blow it""; the soulless Nellee Hooper 90s R&B; vanity affair ""Luxurious""; and the rest of LAMB's zombied buy-LAMB-clothing mantras and transparent Hollywood Dream bullshit-- the Joker's free-money parade through Gotham City was a much more entertaining display of wealth, and he had Prince, not just Wendy & Lisa.

With the Lights Out,Nirvana,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40deb335119a49ed864/1:1/w_160/e4e1db4a.jpg,2004-11-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5811-with-the-lights-out/,Geffen,"Above my desk I have a postcard-sized picture of Kurt Cobain, a garish, iconic (and, appropriately, ironic) portrait on black velvet that someone gave me as a birthday gift a long time ago. Recently, my 13-year old brother-in-law pointed at it and asked, ""Who is that?"" I told him it was Kurt Cobain. ""You know, the lead singer of Nirvana."" This kid is a music fan. He digs Eminem, Jay-Z, and Kanye West, in particular, but Linkin Park and P.O.D. are also in the mix. He'd never heard of Nirvana. Journalist Neil Strauss tells a similar story in the book included with this odds 'n' sods box set, of polling teenagers in a California record store and realizing only about a third of them had knowledge of Cobain & Co. Usually, this sort of unscientific rock crit device involves bands like The Replacements and is meant to demonstrate that, despite perceived greatness among fans, the group in question was denied access to the big time. But Nirvana was the global rock band for a few years not so long ago, so if it's true that Generation Z is ambivalent at best, well, that seems a little strange-- especially considering how much every popular American rock band-- the P.O.D.s and Linkin Parks, for example-- owe them. After allowing Nirvana to lie fallow for almost a decade following the release of the live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, and Courtney Love are now working to reverse this trend. A box set containing a promised mother lode of unreleased recordings was first discussed a few years ago, but it was delayed by legal squabbles. Eventually, Love was granted her wish to release an eponymous best-of complete with ""You Know You're Right"", considered the cream of the then-unreleased crop. Nirvana did little to bolster the band's legacy, though, and with its lone new song, the collection-- otherwise pulled from a tiny catalog-- was most often discussed to explain the appeal of illegal file-sharing. Now the long-awaited box arrives, bearing three music discs, a live DVD, notes by Strauss and Thurston Moore, a wonderfully obsessive recording history (though no discography), and ugly metallic packaging that would have made Cobain, an accomplished visual artist, throw up. Only nine of the set's 51 tracks have been previously released (though many have been bootlegged), and those are culled from B-sides and compilation appearances. It's a scruffy hodgepodge of solo acoustic and full-band demos, radio shots, and live recordings, hugely variable in terms of sound, songwriting, and performance quality. So, first, the bad news: Those hoping for a trove of overlooked gems will be disappointed, as too much of With the Lights Out sounds like nothing so much as a dull-edged instrument lifting flakes of material from the bottom of a barrel. Simply put, there's enough good stuff here for a solid single disc. Beyond padding the release to box-set length, why include a sub-Barlow stab at four-track tape manipulation (""Beans""), two versions of ""Polly"" to go with the four already released (every Nirvana record on Geffen except In Utero features this middling song), two demos of ""Rape Me"" showcasing Cobain at his self-conscious worst, and a number of live tracks that sound like they were recorded on overused speech cassettes? If tossed-off experiments and poorly recorded demos of familiar songs are fair game, one imagines the Nirvana vaults stretching into bottomless ""Dick's Picks"" infinity. Still, the live and demo overkill can't erase Cobain's status as a great songwriter and (usually) one of rock's best vocalists, so there's still a fair amount of content here to enjoy. ""If You Must"" and ""Pen Cap Chew"" immortalize pre-Bleach Nirvana as self-loathing, drop-tuned stoners-- endearing qualities that never quite disappeared from their better known recordings. ""Even in His Youth"" has that classic combination of short, tense verses with a defusing swoop of chorus. And 1991's ""Old Age"" is loose and midtempo, showing Cobain stretching himself melodically, breaking free of the clipped phrases and soft/loud style that was serving him so well at the time. Elsewhere, ""Verse Chorus Verse"" is a completely different song than the one released under the same name on the No Alternative compilation (that one was originally called ""Sappy"", and is also included here), but shows a similar easy restraint. The nine-minute instrumental jam on ""Scentless Apprentice"" was also worth rescuing, showing the lumbering riff monster Nirvana could summon when in the mood. Additionally, versions of four Leadbelly songs, including ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"", document Cobain's strange obsession with the early folk singer. Oddly, despite its big holiday marketing push, this is probably a set for the Nirvana fanatics in search of a complete picture of the band, particularly because many of its pleasures are purely historical. There's no definitive date on the horribly recorded rehearsal demo of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" but it's interesting to note that the structure of the song, down to the tiniest detail, was already complete. And Cobain's off-the-chain scream is completely exhilarating despite the bad sound. Same goes for ""Dive"", which remains powerful though the band is ragged and Cobain can't quite muster the vocal power of the Incesticide version. About 20 of these tracks are solo acoustic demos, offering a leering look into Cobain's creative process. One thing we learn is that he wasn't a good acoustic guitarist, at least not when he was sitting at home on whatever he was on. The sloppy strumming on ""Sliver"" and ""Pennyroyal Tea"" is distracting, but not nearly as disconcerting as the solo demo of ""Rape Me"", on which Cobain seems to be struggling to maintain consciousness. This is where the box set makes you feel a little gross, pawing through the musical equivalent of Cobain's journals, listening to things he never intended to release. The DVD, on the other hand, includes some more lighthearted voyeuristic moments that are the highlight of the box. The first nine tracks are given over to a 1988 rehearsal at Novoselic's mom's house, and it's a huge kick to see Cobain and Novoselic so young and goofy, hanging out with a few neighborhood dudes and jamming like any other local band. For whatever reason, Cobain sings facing a wall with his nose two inches from the simulated wood paneling. They have a ball with Zep (""Immigrant Song""), but then they bust out ""About a Girl"" and we remember that this is not your everyday garage band. When they crank up the strobe light and hold a bottle of Rainier up to the camera, it's adorable enough that you might feel inclined to hug somebody. Fittingly, most of the remainder of the DVD features pre-fame shows and miscellaneous tour footage; technically, it's generally of poor quality, but enjoyable nonetheless. Though With the Lights Out is in many respects unsatisfying and shows Geffen to be rudderless with their handling of the Nirvana legacy, in the end, it's nearly enough that it documents so much material we haven't heard a million times before. And despite the complete predictability and heavy-handedness of closing the set with the solo demo of ""All Apologies"", the effect is still emotionally devastating. When Cobain was numb on heroin he missed the comfort in being sad, and if nothing else, With the Lights Out brings us back to this nourishing place.","After years of personal squabbles and legal woes, a Nirvana box set is finally released. Originally slated for Christmas 2001, the three-CD, one-DVD With the Lights Out compiles demos, B-sides, radio performances, and other rarities.

"Walking Cloud, Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined",Mono,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a45e6ef95969323895/1:1/w_160/6f25ed65.jpg,2004-11-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5404-walking-cloud-deep-red-sky-flag-fluttered-and-the-sun-shined/,Temporary Residence,"When Japanese post-rock quartet Mono signed up to record their new album-- eventually titled Walking Cloud, Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined-- with Steve Albini, it seemed like a good match. The famed producer's canny, famously intense production is well suited to the group's characteristically dense, distortion-smeared instrumental surges. Mono needed the boost, too: Crescendo-heavy orchestral post-rock has been spread paper thin for the better part of a decade, and the band's previous album, One Step More and You Die, walked already well-trod territory. In an overextended genre-- one that values sonic evolution and unique sounds-- mere competency just isn't good enough, so the follow up to One Step would likely be a sink-or-swim affair. Counter-intuitively, Albini's production has dramatically subdued Mono's sound. The band's crashing waves of guitar and stereo-shattering post-rock barrages have been limited to a handful of tracks. In their place are more delicate, introspective compositions, which theoretically should expand the band's potential; in practice, however, they hinder it. The album begins promisingly enough: On the thoughtful, understated ""16.12"", Mono slowly and methodically layer guitar distortion and insistent, thundering percussion upon a backdrop of delicate strings, bass patterns, and washes of cymbal-- overwhelming the track in oppressive noise. The simple tension/release model is surprisingly effective, in part because Albini's crisp production distinguishes each instrumental element while still retaining the appealing impenetrability of the band's dense construction. On the rest of the album the band mostly forgoes its trademark deafening climaxes in favor of fragile atmospheric pieces. One exception is the powerful ""Halcyon (Beautiful Days)"", whose unexpected mid-song wall-of-guitar explosion is a surprise highlight. Tracks such as ""Ode"" and ""Mere Your Pathetique Light"", however, develop unadorned guitar figures into adept Godspeed warm-ups without any payoffs, while ""2 Candles, 1 Wish"" offers a memorable piano/guitar melody, but sputters out in less than three minutes. The indistinguishable orchestral muddle of the title track is also brief; it's an unnecessary interlude on an album already weighed down with meandering atmospheric filler. The dense rush of ""Lost Snow"" and bittersweet closing ballad ""A Thousand Paper Cranes""-- based on the story of Sadako, a young Hiroshima victim who attempted to overcome her leukemia by superstitiously crafting hundreds of origami cranes-- can't fully relieve the album's tedious predictability. ""Crane""'s simple piano foundation seems relatively uninspired, particularly given the emotional heft of the song's inspiration. Mono have wisely restrained from directly replicating their previous sound, but here the band has sacrificed sonic heaviness for intellectual ponderousness, and too often has fallen prey to slow, repetitive, tiresome songwriting patterns and a frustrating lack of variation.","When Japanese post-rock quartet Mono signed up to record their new album-- eventually titled Walking Cloud, Deep Red Sky, Flag ...

Zwei,Turing Machine,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83313d19756521395c3/1:1/w_160/946aa7b5.jpg,2004-11-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8191-zwei/,Frenchkiss,"I can think of exactly two reasons why Turing Machine might have chosen the name they did. The first is more probable (Occam's Razor and all that): They liked how it sounded. The second is unlikely, but too ingenious to ignore. Consider this scenario: Turing Machine read music criticism and glean that the field is crowded with pedants. They realize that the name ""Turing Machine"" might distinguish them from the math-rock pack and sway reviews in their favor. Sure enough, bylined sophists hit the Internet for descriptions of the machine, catching wind of a brainy metaphor for Turing Machine's music that will also justify the most self-gratifying, highfalutin prose. They expound upon its qualities as if they've been intimately familiar with them since birth, so nonchalantly that you might even think they're building one in their garage. The sneaky part is that after you've spent a couple paragraphs linking a band's music to an arcane invention, particularly one whose inventor is synonymous with genius, it's almost impossible to speak poorly of them. It wouldn't serve the concept. I doubt Turing Machine had any of this in mind, but you never know... Lucky for you, Reader, I don't know much of anything about Turing machines. I do understand that they're more like algorithms-- abstract computational devices-- than actual machines, and they certainly couldn't be constructed in a garage or any other physical location. Happily, my ignorance saves us all from having to slog through a lot of hubris about drums as tape cells and guitars as read-write heads or whatever. The cumbersome analogy would be doubly unnecessary given that Zwei-- unlike Turing Machine's colder and mathier debut, A New Machine for Living-- patly describes itself. It retains Turing Machine's technical acumen while funneling it into more bodily pleasures. Math rock finds purchase in the analytical mind, which admires it from a clinical remove, but the primal throb of Zwei occurs in the nerve endings, in the skin. After the demise of their math-rock band Pitchblende, Justin Chearno and Scott DeSimon teamed with Vineland drummer Gerard Fuchs to form Turing Machine. Chearno also plays in the incendiary party-punk act Panthers, but barring the occasional choppy bass line, Turing Machine has more in common with Pitchblende's unhinged skronk. At least their first album did. The superior Zwei relies more upon the narcotic repetition and swirling psychedelia of Krautrock icons like Can than elaborate meters. Like Turing Machine's debut, Zwei is a seven-track full-length that primarily features tracks ranging from mid-sized epics to full-blown 13-minute opuses. There are no vocals, which might be a deal-breaker for those of you who swore off instrumental indie-prog after Don Cab called it quits. It was all the rage in the '90s, but as musicians realized that complexity can substitue for good songwriting, the genre became at once clogged and diluted. Zwei, by insinuating a steady pulse into its musical gymnastics, seems to slightly rejuvenate it. ""Bleach It Black"" features the galloping drums and tight post-punk bass preferred by Panthers, with long, gleaming sheets of tremulously melodic, late Les Savy Fav-ish guitar leads, and dense volleys of overdriven chords. The whorls of bass and guitar on ""Bitte, Baby, Bitte"" are articulations of melodic friction, creating a rippling, lustrous surface that shifts between serrated topography and plateaued reverberation. And the rigid new wave stomp of ""Don't Mind If I Don't"" is tempered by staccato chords and questing soloing (so Seth Jabour, down to the guitar-as-synth tone and sprint / glide structure); like most of the record, its relentless linearity evokes rapid motion through bright and colorful spaces. Every town has at least one band-- often including a few bookish fellows and one fat, sweaty dude-- whose sets seem more like gear expos than performances, the indie equivalents to guys who ride around town playing bass-test sequences on their customized stereo systems. No wonder the genre gets a bad rap. But enjoying Zwei requires no specialized knowledge of chromatic chords or alternate tunings. It's a prolonged melodic roar that mystifies without obscuring-- a clean, lambent line of power and nuance.","Turing Machine follow their DFA-produced 2000 debut A New Machine for Living by funneling their mathy technical acumen into more bodily pleasures. Japanese post-rock quartet Mono teams with super-producer Steve Albini for another album of crescendo-heavy orchestral rock.

A Trip to Marineville / Jane From Occupied Europe,Swell Maps,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6059d034d5c69bf3432/1:1/w_160/7de16a43.jpg,2004-11-22 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11838-a-trip-to-marineville-jane-from-occupied-europe/,Thirsty EarThirsty Ear,"When you're 13 years old living in Solihull, England, is there anything better to do than form a band? Never mind your musical acumen-- what else would you do? This is how Swell Maps formed in 1972: six kids in their early teens calling themselves Sacred Mushroom and fancying themselves a band-- in spite of the fact that they never gigged or recorded until 1977, after punk broke and they realized they could get studio time. Even then, Swell Maps were anything but a conventional band. They were officially a sextet but they recorded with whomever happened to be in the studio at the moment. Jowe Head is out to the sandwich shop? Well, he'll hear it when he gets back. If he returns and discovers that a bassline already exists for ""Midget Submarine"", he can merely pick up a vacuum cleaner and play that instead. Of course, we're also talking about a band that didn't bother rehearsing, began writing their own songs because they couldn't play anyone else's, thought prog and punk were equally great in 1978, and cited Gerry Anderson's television puppet shows ""Thunderbirds"" and ""Stingray"" as equal influences to Can and T. Rex. They recorded a huge amount of material between 1977 and 1980, but only released two proper albums and a handful of maxi singles in their time together-- out of a sense of obligation, they actually finished recording their second LP after they had broken up. Considering their strange story, it's hardly a wonder that the two albums Swell Maps cut are as weird and wonderful as they are. The two records-- 1979's A Trip to Marineville (the title was taken from an episode of ""Stingray"") and 1980's Jane From Occupied Europe-- are nothing if not consistent. In the case of Swell Maps, that means consistently manic, unfocused, chaotic, uniquely unprofessional, and quite charming. There aren't any other records from the post-punk era that sound quite like these-- Television Personalities' And Don't the Kids Just Love it comes close for cheekiness, but doesn't match them sonically-- and the reckless abandon and spontaneity of the band and producer John Rivers shines brightly and brilliantly on these remasters. Not that hi-fi sound was ever central to the Swell Maps experience, but it certainly doesn't hurt. Separating the albums contextually, one could say that Marineville is more song-oriented and Jane is more jam-centered. That's correct, to a point. The fact is that both albums veer erratically from bursts of eccentric punk and (probably inebriated) harmony vocals into nightmarish noise concoctions, offering catchy psych-punk nuggets almost as an excuse for the improvised scrapings that surround them. Principle vocalist Nikki Sudden sounds like he thinks the band could have a hit on the relatively accessible and melodic ""Another Song"" and ""Spitfire Parade"", but the band also veer far into leftfield on squalls of loosely sculptured sound such as ""Adventuring into Basketry"" and ""Big Maz in the Desert"". Really, it's a lot to take in-- the band don't even seem to realize the havoc that their meandering Can/surf/industrial/found object instrumentals and jarring sequencing can visit upon the listener, so it's best to just sit back and take it all in stride. What sounds like a mess when you think too much about it reveals its own internal logic when you let the charm of Epic Soundtracks' wild drum fills and the band's drinking-song harmonies work their magic. There are also surprising moments of beauty, like the strangely poignant piano piece ""Don't Throw Ashtrays at Me!"", which features the recorded mutterings of band members, or the haunting ""Trans-Europe Express"" synth line that rises out of nowhere in the droning punk song ""Cake Shop Girl"". But by all means, if you have any interest in the original post-punk era, do take it all in, because Swell Maps were one of the most unique pieces of Britain's great late-70s musical puzzle. These albums have never been particularly easy to procure stateside, so it's nice to finally have them in wide circulation, even if Secretly Canadian wound up including fewer bonus tracks than most of the overseas reissues (they've sort of made up for this by including newly conceived Quicktime videos for ""Midget Submarine"" and non-LP track ""Let's Build a Car""). It's a shame the band stopped when they did, but what little they left behind is one hell of an enjoyable legacy.",,8.3,
"The Capitol Albums, Vol. 1",The Beatles,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4425e6ef95969320822/1:1/w_160/f5af56ca.gif,2004-11-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1094-the-capitol-albums-vol-1/,Capitol,"I. What is this box set about? A. The set contains the first four American-version Beatles records, all from 1964, in mono and new stereo mixes. Meet the Beatles The Beatles' Second Album Something New Beatles '65 B. It also contains a 48-page booklet with notes by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn (The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions).
C. These albums have never been available on CD until now.
D. These albums have never been available in stereo in any format until now. They were remastered from the original Capitol master tapes. The stereo effect was actually produced by using the two original tracks of mono, compressing them and then adding some reverb. (i.e., these aren't actual ""stereo"" performances, but ""duophonic."") E. The albums are presented in miniature replicas of the original LP jackets. II. Is it worthwhile for Beatle fanatics? Casual fans? A. Since most fans have owned the British versions of the Beatles' albums for years, this set is most valuable to American fans who lived through Beatlemania, or as a curio to the rest of us.
B. The packaging seems hastily assembled. The CDs don't even come in inner sleeves, so they always fall out when you pick them up.
C. Casual fans would be better off sticking to the British albums (on EMI), as they contain most of this music in superior mixes. They also have the notable characteristic of being the records the Beatles wanted to make, unlike these Capitol-assembled compilations.
D. Nobody really needs to own ""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand"" twice-- owning the Past Masters sets takes care of all the non-album singles, and the British albums have the rest. III. Do the stereo mixes sound good? A. Remember, it's ""duophonic,"" not stereo. The Pet Sounds reissue from a few years ago is a much better example of presenting in stereo an album that was originally released in mono.
B. The Capitol mixes are filled with reverb. This gets annoying after a while, because all the vocals sound cavernous.
C. That said, the instrumental tracks are clearer. IV. Why did they only do this for these albums, and not the rest of the catalog? A. The existing Beatles' CD catalog hasn't been remastered because there is no need. The sound is good, especially considering when they were remastered (1987). They still sell well. There's no need to fix what isn't broken. B. That said, I'd love to hear a 24-bit treatment of the Beatles' records. Few bands deserve to be heard in optimal sound more than them. V. How do the individual albums hold up? A. Meet the Beatles There isn't a bad song on this record, with the possible exception of McCartney's ""Hold Me Tight"", which lacks a good melody, and features some of the least interesting lyrics in the Beatles' canon (""Hold me tight/ Tell me I'm the only one/ And then I might/ Never be the lonely one""? D'oh!). Leading off with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""I Saw Her Standing There"" leads to a slightly anti-climactic experience for the remainder of the record. I can't imagine ever listening to the mono versions of these songs again. But then, I can't really imagine playing these albums much anyway. B. The Beatles' Second Album Alright, that's not fair. There is some historical value to hearing this stuff. So, go history. ""She Loves You"" is still one of my favorite Beatles singles. Cover version war: Lennon singing ""Money"" and ""Please Mr. Postman"" towers over McCartney's ""Long Tall Sally"" and Harrison's ""Roll Over Beethoven"". However, just like the British edition of Beatles for Sale (1964), this album seems overrun with covers. C. Something New Now we're getting good: ""Things We Said Today"" and ""If I Fell"" are two of the best pre-Rubber Soul Beatle songs. ""And I Love Her"" also nods to the direction the band would take starting in 1965. And yet, Capitol thought ""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand"" complimented them well. Still, this seems like the most thoughtfully compiled of the Capitol albums. D. Beatles '65 And this is the most haphazardly compiled. ""I'm a Loser"", ""No Reply"", and ""I'll Follow the Sun"" stand up to the best early Beatles songs, but seem out of place on a record featuring ""Rock and Roll Music"", ""Mr. Moonlight"", and ""Honey Don't"". ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"" has more reverb than any song I've ever heard. Okay, maybe not more than that last Acid Mothers Temple album, but close. Capitol kept releasing different versions of the Beatles' records until Sgt. Pepper's in 1967. According to some, the Beatles protested in 1966 by delivering the infamous ""butchered baby"" cover photo for Yesterday... And Today. If Capitol put that in the next box, I'd give an extra point just on principle. VI. Anything else? Not really. I'm giving this a 6 because while there's a lot of great music here, there's very little incentive for me to play it, and none of these albums compare favorably to their British counterparts. Oh well. Next up: McCartney's ready for some football.","The Beatles are the subject of yet another reissue campaign. This time it's a box set compiling the band's four 1964 U.S. albums-- Meet the Beatles, The Beatles' Second Album, Something New, and Beatles '65-- none of which have been previously issued on CD.

I Before E,Carissa's Wierd,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71f9d034d5c69bf36fb/1:1/w_160/43ab5482.jpg,2004-11-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1784-i-before-e/,Sad Robot,"Mat Brooke and Jenn Ghetto, the creative force behind Carissa's Wierd, have spent the past several years soundtracking the indie community's collective misery, gradually gaining accolades in their Seattle home for wistful, at times devastating, tales of loss and dejection before unexpectedly dissolving the band in late 2003. Their slow, rueful country-tinged indie rock sound hasn't changed much during their short-lived recording career-- but the world certainly has, and an increasingly popular tendency to curl into a foetal ball and wallow in self-pity makes their music seem more timely and palatable. I Before E, a piecemeal album consisting of three new Carissa's tracks and a live performance, is fittingly jumbled and confused, and frequently moving. The new tracks are among the most intricate songs the band has composed. The dirge-paced ""Phantom Fireworks"" crawls out of the gate, stumbling along with a simple, repeating guitar figure supporting Brooke's breathy vocals. Gradually, stark slide guitar and viola accompaniment emerge from the track's shadows, building until the song's group chorus. ""Die"" is the album's strongest track, and one of the best songs Carissa's Wierd has recorded. The song's liveliness conceals its melancholic directness (""Die/ Die/ I want to die""), and its flexible shifting between earnest piano ballad and upbeat pop suggests a newfound complexity in composition. The relatively straightforward ballad ""Blue Champagne Glass"" is more characteristic of the band's earlier material, and it acts as a nice transition into the live material. The remaining tracks document the band's final performances at Seattle's Crocodile Cafe, using songs from earlier albums (which are scheduled for wider re-release later this year). The performance is solid and well received, putting the band's characteristic despondency in a context that studio albums have never provided. There is discernible warmth in these tracks, and the appreciative audience helps underscore the tenderness so often overshadowed by their recorded material's relative starkness. Though the live tracks are an excellent gift to the group's fans, it's a shame that the songs are much simpler than the new studio material. Carissa's Wierd's sound had room for maturation and experimentation, and there's something somewhat unsatisfying about the album's lack of cohesion-- even if a certain disjointedness should be expected given the project's limitations. Still, the muted orchestral swell of ""Drunk with the Only Saints I Know"", bittersweet string melody of ""Bathtile Green"", and subtle drive of closer ""Fluorescent Light"" are excellent reminders of the band's abililty to balance an outward dreariness with great melodies and inspired songwriting. I Before E is scattered but ultimately rewarding, largely depressing with the slightest hints of optimism shining through a bleak exterior-- and an appropriately poignant swan song.","Mat Brooke and Jenn Ghetto, the creative force behind Carissa's Wierd, have spent the past several years soundtracking the ...

Bidnezz,Machinedrum,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3595e6ef959693237fc/1:1/w_160/3677c7bd.jpg,2004-11-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5021-bidnezz/,Merck,"Prefuse 73's Scott Herren didn't patent glitch-hop; he simply popularized the ""cutup"" method of cramming as many damn musical thoughts as possible into each minute. Many other underground luminaries had already connected Dirty South crunk with the cubist contortions of Autechre and Mouse on Mars: Push Button Objects, Funkstorung, Otto Von Schirach, and Jimmy Edgar, to name a few. Deriding these artists for plagiarizing each other's ideas would be remiss. It would be like rejecting the entire generation of 60s Anglo blues geeks who mimicked (some say bastardized) the harmonics and attitudes of their Chess 45s. That said, Bidnezz-- the fourth albun from Machine Drum's Travis Stewart-- could sound to some like a collection of One Word Extinguisher b-sides. However, Stewart's record has more breathing space than and a tunefulness that seems missing in Prefuse 73's beat obsession. Plus, Stewart already made his name in glitch-hop with the 2001 milestone, Now You Know, which was released months before many critics sold Herren as indie hip-hop's reason for living. Bidnezz is a continuation of the haphazard rhythms and poetics that Stewart toyed with on his previous album, Urban Biology, but without that record's cavity-grinding sentimentality. Soulful moments like ""Time Turned Over Itself"" resemble cool-jazz/R&B; soundtracks for auto malls or mutual fund commercials whose satellite transmissions got frayed in the Earth's shattered ozone layer. It's an ace noise. Opener ""Entrau"" is a throat-clearing introduction that loops a keyboard ring from the ""dream sequence"" of some kiddie TV show. Right before the ecstasy rubs salt in the ear, the amputated crunk of ""Disa Bling"" hobbles in. There, female ""eh's"" are ricocheted between a muttering background and a shouting foreground, while some distracting dub organ vamps are thrown in for good measure. ""$$legs"" brims with AM static-clogged, hip-hop thuds that sink a Holiday Inn lounge piano tune. And then arrives ""Babbling"", a diarrheal DSP release of scrambled voices from the dead. Stewart, bless his mortal soul, disrupts the album's groove with such abrupt tracks of whooshing musique concrete repellant like ""Worldcomin"", ""Wiggle"", and the vile ""Badgerman"". The digitally incomprehensible recording of homeys bragging about their Dirty South beats in ""Hipsteos"" almost qualifies, but at least it's about something. Meaningful discord also graces the album's highlights-- Stewart gets bored when things grow too pleasant.

Bidnezz's most arresting moment, ""Mltply"", skitters a Rhodes-funk riff over a sublime, blue-sky flute duet with upright bass. ""End of C"" is a minute-long trance of strings time-stretched into a leaking flood basin that wrecks the song's recording tape. You frighten me, Stewart.","Glitch-hop maverick Travis Stewart (Machine Drum) shows off his short-attention span on his latest for the Miami-based Merck label.

"Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1",DiploM.I.A.,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c52d5e6ef95969323a67/1:1/w_160/d0f53cee.jpg,2004-11-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5617-piracy-funds-terrorism-vol-1/,Hollertronix,"Santa Claus, the Virgin Mary, and Terrence ""Turkeytime"" Terrence just got the shaft this holiday season. Why bother with presents? 2005's Tickle Me Elmo was supposed to be a chicken-legged Sri Lankan with so much sex in her self-spun neons you might as well get wasted off penicillin with Willie Nelson at a secret Rex the Dog show. But guess what? On Halloween she showed up in Philadelphia for her Fader gig, sat herself under a big fucking Christmas tree, and dished out free copies of Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1, the mixtape masterpiece she and Diplo Hollertronix had spent the 10 previous days putting together in his apartment. Batteries included! So a large portion of her forthcoming debut, Arular, has willfully gone leaky boat here. Many of her tracks sound similar to one another: A 505 Groovebox queefs out splatty, farty beats and M.I.A. shouts lyrics of varying snark over them, sometimes even singing them. (Sometimes.) She's been irresistible in single land, but M.I.A.'s full-length runs the risk of seeming limited and discrediting her misleading but awesome ""female Dizzee Rascal"" tag, replacing that description with ""Neneh Cherry, Mk. II""-- a label that has likely dawned on anyone who has seen the ""Buffalo Stance""-like ""Galang"" video. That is why this mixtape kills: The format fits M.I.A. perfectly. Her songs benefit greatly from Diplo's recent baile funk fetish (confer his recent Favela On Blast tape), some choice dub and American hip-hop cuts to break up the blaze to blaze and razorblades, and some flat-out brilliant mashups. On the upstroke, ""Galang"" goes reggaeton; on the down, Diplo cops the song a Lil Vicious beat and a lil keyboard hook, and it's so whoa you'll have to punch yourself in the face to stop smiling. ""Fire Fire"" goes bam bam then walks like an Egyptian in a telling Bangles mashup-- the two songs play so nicely together they could be siamese, until Diplo misdemeans ""Pass That Dutch"" with M.I.A.'s snakey music box schwarma. M.I.A.'s ""Amazon"" coupled with Ciara's radio-friendly microcrunk squelch is an early highlight, though that squirmy synth on Clipse's ""Definition of a Roller"" makes for good freak, too, packing just enough snaggletooth funk to forgive those recent Neptunes missteps. For a tape whose initial appeal was the instant and gratifying relief it brought to everyone waiting for M.I.A.'s full-length, Diplo ironically saves M.I.A.'s best cuts for last. ""URAQT"" is a jittery mess of flirting, territory-marking, and text-messaging (!): ""You fuckin with my man and you text him all the time/ You mighta had him once but I have him all the time,"" and later, ""U-R-A-Q-T/ Is your daddy dealer, cause you're dope to me!"" For dessert, Diplo brings ""Big Pimpin'"" out of retirement to back M.I.A.'s raspy ""Bingo"": ""Do you know what is on? Do you know what is on? Do you know how this beat is made in fucking Lon-d-d-don?"" The song's obviously great, but between M.I.A.'s fierce deliveries and the braggart beat, it sounds weird and ominous, a black-hole closer to an album brimming with life. Last week, Sasha Frere-Jones profiled M.I.A. in The New Yorker, spraypainting her as a consummate and naturally ""world"" artist. M.I.A. is silly, dancey, cheap, expensive, truthful, and utterly serious all at once-- just like the world (!). She's not exactly rags-to-riches (yet), but her pop carries unwittingly significant weight, and to potentially far more people than just a few hundred ecstatic MP3 blog readers. It's one thing for M.I.A. to be a ""world"" pop star; it will be another thing for her to release an album that reflects that backstory. For now, Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1 takes that burden off of Arular: Diplo has actualized our hopes for M.I.A. qua world pop star, and we didn't even have to leave him cookies.",,8.5,
How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,U2,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8cac0084474cd0c0eed/1:1/w_160/f3fd1783.jpg,2004-11-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8330-how-to-dismantle-an-atomic-bomb/,Interscope,"U2 has been crowned the biggest band in the world so many times that, at least conceptually, they've finally managed to transcend themselves, ditching their earthly digs and assuming cartoonish proportions. And that might be why the four silhouettes currently twitching across America's TV screens, jerkily promoting U2-branded iPods over big, neon expanses, seem so eerily apropos: the flesh and blood members of U2 have been reduced to signifiers, mock-ups, representatives. They are bigger than their band. Produced by arena-guru Steve Lillywhite (with help from longtime twiddlers Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Flood), U2's 11th LP, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, is brash, grungy, and loud-- everything R.E.M. tried (and failed) to be on Monster, and everything U2 opted out of being on 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind. Still, Atomic Bomb is not an especially surprising record. It's a classic mix of colossal ballads and jerky rockers-- part-The Unforgettable Fire, part-Achtung Baby. Theoretically, Atomic Bomb weds classic U2 (echoing guitars, big sound, soaring vocals) with nu-U2 (experimental tweaks, electronic flourishes) but, high aspirations aside, the only marriage the record ultimately achieves is the union of good U2 and bad U2. So take a deep breath and prepare for a tiny handful of outstanding tracks and a whole mess of schmaltzy filler. U2 may be a staunchly democratic machine (ask Eno), but Bono is still singularly responsible for propelling U2-as-uber-group forward, leering out from behind oversized yellow goggles, crusading righteously to reduce Third World debt, campaigning against AIDS, spitting post-Beat induction speeches from Jann Wenner's Hall of Fame podium, bobbing stupidly for Apple, talking and talking and talking about himself. Publicly, U2 are overblown and decadent, sporting silly, abstract monikers and booking colossal stadium tours, calling presidents, wearing sunglasses in the dark, anchoring the Super Bowl, pushing products. Bono is 43 years old, boasts remarkable sway both inside and outside the pop culture sphere, and fronts one of the most universally recognizable rock bands of all time: He is a neo-superstar-- global, important, impossibly entertaining, and forever tiptoeing the line between wholly extraordinary and idiotically self-obsessed. Despite a deliberately leading album title-- and one lone, overtly suggestive song title (""Love and Peace Or Else"")-- How to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is a curiously apolitical record, more about love and loyalty (and the 2001 death of Bono's father) than impending global doom. The decision to sidestep bold politicking and instead highlight feelings-and-guitars is a particularly compelling one right now, given the super-charged months preceding the record's release (and the melange of global conflicts now escalating to new levels of absurdity). Listeners are left wondering if Bono's elbows-deep international activism has somehow turned him off to the (comparably nebulous) effort of writing protest songs-- has all the dirt under his fingernails made the act of emoting into a microphone seem a little less urgent? ""Saving the world is now a daily chore,"" Bono joked to The New York Times-- even in jest, it's a completely ridiculous thing to say. And yet? Deliberately or not, Bono-as-bespectacled-celebrity-crusader seeps into nearly everything U2 does, sometimes to significant aesthetic effect: When Bono starts cawing urgently about a place called ""Vertigo"", declaring it ""everything I wish I didn't know,"" it's possible that he's talking about girls or his father or his band-- or Bono might be squealing about something far worse, something awful, something most of us are lucky enough to have never witnessed. The problem is that it's extraordinarily difficult to ever really know exactly what Bono is talking about. Almost without exception, Bono yowls vague, cliched observations, his sentiments always awkwardly bombastic or hopelessly maudlin (check ""Miracle Drug,"" where we are invited to ponder how ""Freedom has a scent/ Like the top of a newborn baby's head,"" or ""A Man and A Woman"", where we contemplate ""the mysterious distance between a man and a woman,"" or even just repeated-- seriously!-- ""Where is the love?"" demands.) Loads of listeners have already noted that opener ""Vertigo"" bears an odd resemblance to The Supremes' gorgeously desperate ""You Keep Me Hanging On"", except ""Vertigo"" is framed by a classic punk shout-down where-- get this!-- Bono's totally singing in Spanish! Wait, he said catorce! It's a classic U2 moment: worldly, frantic, irritatingly deliberate. But when the Edge slams into his guitar, hollering a smirky ""Hola!"" to Bono's quasi-confrontational ""Hello, hello!"" it's awfully easy to forgive: ""Vertigo"" is hopelessly appealing, somehow growing less stupid and more compelling with each listen. ""Vertigo"" is followed by a pair of swirly half-ballads, the plodding, overblown ""Miracle Drug"" and the super-sappy ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"", before we're mercifully handed ""Love and Peace Or Else"", a snarly, throbbing bit of solace. ""Love and Peace"" opens with a platter of ominous noise, shaky guitar grumbles rubbing up against high-pitched whines. Drums rumble, and Bono lodges his best semi-seductive demand: ""Lay down, lay down."" ""Love and Peace"" is chased by the equally exhilarating ""City of Blinding Lights"", an earnest and galactic fight song, and the sort of track that's best enjoyed in cars and airplanes, simply because it encites so much giddy movement. But ""City of Blinding Lights"" is the record's climax, and How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb begins its gnawing descent almost immediately, culminating with disastrous closer ""Yahweh"", a whiny, monotonous mess that's easily one of the worst songs U2 have ever recorded. Maybe the biggest problem with Atomic Bomb is just that it sounds so much like U2, and their semi-absurd, totally unparalleled ubiquity has left all of us just a tiny bit tired of listening to things that sound like U2. This isn't completely their fault-- they tried to change (see the questionable Zooropa or the disastrous Pop), and we didn't like that, either. Bono has talked publicly about U2's longevity and quasi-diversity, crediting their shape-shifting to his band's unbreakable internal bonds-- U2 can afford to mess around, because the ""spirit"" of the band is so strong, so infinitely recognizable. But maybe U2's immortality is also their biggest curse-- and now they're forced to wallow in superstardom, forever perpetuating their own colossal myth.","After a four-year absence, U2 are once again re-applying for the position of World's Biggest Rock Band with their brash, grungy 11th proper full-length (and 14th overall).

Chiaroscuro / Humcrush,Arve HenriksenStrønen/Storløkken,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e213d197565213906d/1:1/w_160/9207b242.jpg,2004-11-21 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11836-chiaroscuro-humcrush/,Rune Grammofon,"Earlier this month, I flew across the country to see Norway's Supersilent play their first North American concert, at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. Maybe I made the trip to remind myself that there are still bands worth making big, expensive trips for; maybe I was just excited for the experience of watching the band in person. The quartet plays completely improvised music that's wrestled into shape by four distinct musicians; on record, it's difficult to tell how the players interact. At the show, I felt like a car-illiterate driver popping his hood just to stare at the engine: I wanted to watch the pieces working together, even if I wouldn't know what was going on inside of them. If Supersilent has a frontman, it's Arve Henriksen, who sat on stage between keyboardists and noise generators Ståle Storløkken and Helge Sten. In addition to playing trumpet into one of two mics (one had more distortion than the other), Henriksen also sings wordlessly, high and close to how I'd imagine an adult castrati would sound. Unlike a chamber singer, he sounds untrained, airy, and wholly naked: a broken plea stops your breath. Henriksen has rarely used his voice on recordings with Supersilent, but it becomes a crucial instrument on his new solo disc, Chiaroscuro. After working in monk-like solitude on his first album, Sakuteiki (""a treatise on garden making""), he collaborates on Chiaroscuro with two notable Norwegian musicians, percussionist Audun Kleive and sound artist Jan Bang. The thick but passive atmosphere they create warmly blankets Henriksen's trumpet and vocals. The album's most striking moment is its first track, ""Opening Image"". After a trumpet performance on which he struggles for breath-- making the brass instrument sound almost like a reed or a bamboo flute-- Henriksen emits a pure cry. It's such a personal revelation that you'd think professional training would ruin him-- not because it would strip away his beauty but because you'd know what to expect from note to note, and that would ruin the importance of his telling it to you. Chiaroscuro could have been a late '70s ECM date-- from Kleive's ambiguously world influences to the enveloping moods to the sameness of the songwriting. It's so obviously beautiful that you don't feel challenged but right when you drift off, it creeps up on you: Kleive plays an inventive pattern-- for example, the hand drums on ""Parallel Action""-- or a melody starts to sink in. If the album had more variety or used these fragile-sounding elements less cautiously, this would be an exceptional session. At the concert, Henriksen also revealed a rougher side, first singing garbled scat vocals into his trumpet, and then using actual words, which was unexpected from an act as abstract as Supersilent. During a skronky noise piece, Henriksen screamed at us about the recent election: ""OHIO! OHIO! WHY?! MOTHERFUCKER!"" It may have grounded the musical flights but in blue state-housed Frisco, everyone loved it. On the other hand, Ståle Storløkken almost disappointed me. On the Supersilent albums, it's hard to separate Storløkken's contributions from Sten's. He usually reveals himself by playing melodic synth lines while Sten sticks to brutally neutralizing tones that can raze any assertion down to an ambiguous grey. Storløkken is more colorful, so in this context he risks being banal by trumping the band's subtle compromises: His loudest riffs on 6-- the solos on ""6.1"" and the dominating statement that ends ""6.4""-- suit the pieces, but just barely. In concert, Storløkken locked in brilliantly with Sten when they played loudly but in the slow sections, he almost started to noodle-- to play lines that were merely pretty. But maybe I had an eye on him because I had just heard Humcrush, his new duet with drummer Thomas Strønen (Food). Humcrush gallops like a circus-- the first track is called ""Acrobat""-- and it doesn't mind easy gestures: For example, the track called ""Japan"" sounds stereotypically Japanese. Both men use electronics to generate layers of beats, with Strønen adding rhythms that sound like playing cards on a window fan, but the live (in the studio) recording keeps even the densest textures frantic. I love Storløkken's signature analog synth, even though every time I hear it I picture a little plastic spaceship being pulled across a movie screen on a wire; when Storløkken deploys it, he smears fusion-like lines across the top, while at others times-- like ""Sport'n Spice""-- he uses a quick, digital jabbing sound to grapple head-on with Strønen. While different moods emerge, Humcrush is one of the least reflective discs in the Rune Grammofon catalog: It breezes by instead of lingering, which is not a bad thing when you're listening to such proficient musicians dance each other in knots. Henriksen, Storløkken, and Helge Sten (as Deathprod) all released solo or duet records this year, and while each one has its strengths, Supersilent remains greater than the sum of their parts. The unique tension between their players creates something unique and frequently awesome. The humanistic, almost New Age-y Henriksen and the grimly neutral Sten especially become stronger when their different approaches are at odds with one another. But together or by themselves, live or on record, the members of Supersilent still have more to reveal, more corners they haven't explored. Hell, next time I might even fly to Oslo.",,7.1,
The Frequency,The Frequency,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bea95e6ef9596932329d/1:1/w_160/2a013bbb.gif,2004-11-18 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3329-the-frequency/,NFI,"If ever there was a band that lost its way, it was Trans Am. In the mid-90s, these guys were the toast of the post-rock scene-- even though more often than not they actually did rock. Futureworld and The Surveillance were concentrated, nasty albums that sang straight to your machine soul. By the 00s, though, Trans Am LPs became sprawling refuges for labored irony. If anyone can actually remember a thing about the second half of Red Line, I'd be surprised, and Trans Am have only gone downhill from there. Therefore, it only makes sense that the band's members might be itching to try something new, and drummer Sebastian Thomson is the first to head out on his own-- although exactly how new his work as The Frequency actually is to him is open for debate. For one thing, outside of Thomson's omnipresent (and often unremarkable) vocals there's not a whole lot of difference between the dark, buzzing vibe of this album and the late work of Trans Am. There is an absolute ton of sawtoothed synth on this record, and it's heaped on top of an absolute ton of Kraftwerk-styled synth patterns and lockstep beats-- both live and programmed. Thomson's singing give the album more of a focal point than most recent Trans Am fare, but he's frequently found well inside the mix, and often there's little melodic contour for his competent everyman voice to follow. Often, his unaffected voice simply doesn't sound at home in this songs-- I never thought I'd ever have to say ""needs more vocoder,"" but here we are. Bur this album does have plenty going for it. Thomson is a killer drummer but he's not showy, and at the heart of every song lies a solid rhythmic foundation. What Thomson does best is evil synth pop, and the songs that follow that road are usually pretty great, from opener ""You're the Perfect Size"" to the Computer World strut of ""One Chance"" and ""Zapatos Blancos"". ""Erasing Myself"" is less synth-oriented, but it carries the same feel and has some of the album's best vocals-- double tracking does wonders to liven up Thomson's delivery. ""Own Me"" adds almost jangly guitars to an itchy synth groove. It's the album's brightest moment, and one of its best tracks. If the LP were focused solely on this type of material, Thomson would have a pretty handsome record; as it is, he succumbs to his band's tendency to pile on subpar material, and he really loses his footing on the album's more rock-oriented numbers-- check the overripe guitar leads on ""Moonburn"" or the boring, sludgy slog of ""Forgot"", with its weakly shouted vocals and non-melody. So, unfortunately, The Frequency doesn't seem to be a step toward regaining Trans Am's sense of pinpoint focus-- even if it is both stronger than that band's recent releases and contains its share of highlights. There are certainly worse traits for a musician to have than not knowing when to stop, but in this case it's the difference between a good album and a merely fair one.","The Frequency is the solo project from Trans Am drummer Sebastian Thomson.

Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love,Jonathan Richman,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a272ea9e61561daa4a55/1:1/w_160/45ec68bb.jpg,2004-11-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6782-not-so-much-to-be-loved-as-to-love/,Sanctuary,"All right, kids, gather around: Once upon a time, Jonathan Richman was the lead singer of a seminal proto-punk band called The Modern Lovers. He later jettisoned that group's Velvet Underground-tinged drone for an acoustic guitar and gigs on ""Sesame Street"" and in There's Something About Mary. Now the 53-year-old patron saint of the eternally childlike is back with Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love, another set of doe-eyed, goofily innocent songs of love and growing up by a boy genius who never will. With Richman's gentle guitar and Tommy Larkins' birthday-party percussion, this record sounds much like his last outing, 2001's Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow, except this time Richman handles the clean, chaste production himself. But while that album described relationships in all their messy vitality, Not So Much is really a record about art. It obviates criticism-- ""He gave us the wine to taste, not to talk about it,"" Richman sings-- but could inspire ponderous tomes of scholarly exegesis and coloring book after coloring book of outside-the-lines Crayola scribblings. An artist must adhere to his own, singular vision above all else, Richman proposes, and to do so apparently requires all the imagination and unbridled glee of an eight-year-old. Here the man who wrote the immortal ""Pablo Picasso"" breezily revives ""Vincent Van Gogh"", a classic from his long-out-of-print 1986 LP Rockin' and Romance. ""He loved color and he let it show,"" the singer explains. On ""Salvador Dali"", a characteristically earnest narrator describes how Dali's art got him through adolescence and introduced him ""to the dream world, to the dream world."" The album's title, from a prayer by St. Francis of Assisi, is far more than a homily about romantic or platonic love. What's important for Richman and his favorite painters is not popular affection, but their art-- which is an expression of love itself. See? Not So Much is suffused with this creative love. It's the kind of love that necessitates repetition. Van Morrison once called it ""the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves to love the love that loves to love the love that loves,"" layering a few simple Germanic syllables with endless mists of meaning. In a perky, 50s-style love song, Richman calls it ""My Baby Love Love Loves Me"". This kind of love causes Richman to speak in tongues: Italian on the exuberant ""In Che Mondo Viviamo"" and the boisterous bossa nova of ""Cosi Veloce"", French for ""On a Du Soleil"" (a track that's like un chat yawning by a window in the afternoon) and the similarly celestial ""Les Etoiles"". I'm unable to understand either language without Babelfish, but I can still marvel at these sounds. True love ""brings up hurt from when you were five years old,"" Richman once sang. But it also brings up joy.","Another set of doe-eyed, goofily innocent songs of love and growing up by a boy genius who never will.

This Is Music: The Singles 92-98,The Verve,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94b13d197565213983b/1:1/w_160/d9a1ff29.jpg,2004-11-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8455-this-is-music-the-singles-92-98/,Virgin,"He may be better known for his anthems, his ego, and his excess, but Richard Ashcroft also tells a good story. And as the new career-spanning compilation This Is Music: The Singles 92-98 reveals, the history of his band, The Verve, is a good story as well. They began by playing sprawling, kaleidoscopic, heavens-scraping jams. These 60s-style improvisatory mindfucks were then edited down into the slightly less sprawling tracks that comprise the group's 1993 debut, A Storm in Heaven, an intoxicating amalgam of psychedelica and shoegaze. Then Verve became The Verve (jazz 1, rock 0) and started to discipline their diaphanous noisescapes with traditional British songcraft. They released an ecstasy-laden promise of even better things to come, 1995's A Northern Soul. Ashcroft earned praise in song from the biggest band in Britain, Oasis. And then the band broke up. But Ashcroft, the story's iconic hero as well as its raconteur, had prophesied that his band would secure a place in the rock'n'roll firmament. And lo, it was so: The band reformed, and 1997's decade-defining Urban Hymns almost made up for the then-recent demise of Britpop. Sure, Ashcroft went on to release solo albums littered with self-indulgent drivel, and masterful guitarist Nick McCabe has been uncharacteristically quiet. Meanwhile, bassist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury's royalty checks sure aren't writing themselves! (Late addition Simon Tong? He found a gig as Blur's new Graham Coxon.) That just means it's time for the next phase of the story: The singles compilation, complete with ""new"" tracks. If The Verve's tale is Ashcroft's epic, This Is Music is his short-stories anthology. Here's where the narrative starts to fall apart. The disc doesn't follow any recognizable order. So if newcomers want a quick taste of the early Verve's vast, submarine jamming, they'll have to skip to tracks five and eleven, respectively, to hear rare-ish singles ""She's a Superstar"" and ""Gravity Grave."" The conch-shaped guitar lines of first single ""All in the Mind"" announce the group's arrival to the world on track nine. The Ride-like shimmer of ""Slide Away"" (track two) and the droning anthemics of ""Blue"" (track seven) represent the debut full-length admirably, though a little context would be nice. On the other hand, the sophomore album's ""This Is Music"" makes a stirring opener for any compilation, perfectly melding McCabe's searing guitar lines with Ashcroft's spacey vocals. ""If love is a drug then I don't need it,"" Ashcroft declares. The second single from the second record, ""On Your Own,"" introduced audiences to the acoustic balladry-- with handclaps!-- that would reach full bloom on Urban Hymns. It also proved that Ashcroft suffers from the same lyrical banality that often marked Noel Gallagher's compositions. ""Gotta get rid of this hole inside,"" Ashcroft chants, and it sounds like a revelation rather than a tired cliche. Two tracks earlier, ""History"" is another A Northern Soul ballad, with strings from John Lennon's ""Mind Games"" and enough rarefied sadness for a Ford Madox Ford novel. This Is Music boasts four songs from The Verve's masterpiece, Urban Hymns, and all are as revelatory now as they must have been when they capped off Ashcroft's Brit-rock bildungsroman. ""Sonnet"" verges on sappy, but some of Ashcroft's Bono-tastic bombast makes the song soar. ""Lucky Man"" applies the same formula to existential angst and what Whitney Houston called ""The Greatest Love of All."" Both ballads are good, but neither can compare to ""The Drugs Don't Work,"" a marvel of subtlety amid world-weary lyrics-- ""All this talk of getting old is bringing me down""-- and understated strings. This was a hit because it's fucking great. It's that simple. ""Bittersweet Symphony"" marches brazenly through a day in the life, staring head-on at the immutability of the human spirit and our paradoxically mercurial nature (""I'm a million different people""); both realities are true, the song suggests. In America, it's The Verve's only well-known song, but it's one hell of a legacy. Of course, The Verve also are to blame for the uneven British wuss-rock of Travis (once likened to ""cheese on toast"" by Damon Albarn), Keane, and The Veils. They've even influenced American bathos-mongers like Howie Day, who's been known to cover ""The Drugs Don't Work"" in his tantrum-filled live shows. Alas, the two bonus tracks at the end of the compilations don't bolster The Verve's defense. Urban Hymns-era unreleased track ""This Could Be My Moment"" is elegant, uplifting, and as catchy as a TV jingle, but it lacks the world-conquering vision of the songs that actually made that album. ""Monte Carlo"" features a pleasant bass groove, but as soon as I finish this sentence I'll have forgotten how it goes. In sum, This Is Music: The Singles 92-98 features 12 classics and two superfluous tunes from the vault. If you already own the albums, you won't have much use for this compilation. New fans ought to start with Urban Hymns and work their way back, and the arbitrary track order here serves no one. But the songs' quality remains undeniable, and a greatest-hits disc is better than no Verve at all-- at least until Ashcroft writes the final chapter with a ""Behind the Music""-inspired reunion tour.","Career-spanning compilation that moves from post-shoegaze neo-pscyhedelica to Britpop-era heroics.

White People,Handsome Boy Modeling School,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c04deb335119a49ed383/1:1/w_160/10da261b.jpg,2004-11-18 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3725-white-people/,Elektra,"""Prince"" Paul Huston and Dan ""The Automator"" Nakamura both have extensive experience with concept albums. Prince Paul can boast the groundbreaking horrorcore of Gravediggaz and his rap-opera A Prince Among Thieves; Nakamura helped with both the sci-fi epic Deltron 3030 and animated pop band Gorillaz. On their 1999 debut Handsome Boy Modeling School collaboration So... How's Your Girl, the two introduced themselves in slippery alter-egos, as cunning lotharios Chest Rockwell (Prince Paul) and Nathaniel Merriweather (Nakamura), two spokesmen for a $60 finishing school for jetsetters. Between them, their understanding of hip-hop concept records is virtually unmatched-- their projects have displayed ambitious, genre-mashing blends of novelty, unity, and style. And from dozens of in-character interviews (""Handsome people attract other handsome people,"" Merriweather once quipped), to the regal coiffure and handlebar mustaches in their press photos, Paul and Dan consistently projected the HBMS motif in their public appearances. But an amusing concept alone isn't sufficient enough to carry an album, and White People, the overstuffed, underdeveloped, meandering 53-minute musical odyssey that returns them to the spotlight after a half-decade of silence, fails to reflect the audacity of their off-stage personas. Aside from Father Guido Sarducci's sardonic monologues and skits featuring Tim Meadows, the moniker Handsome Boy Modeling School serves its purpose in title only. It follows no particular direction, jumping from Del's sucka emcee baiting on ""The World's Gone Mad"" to Cat Power's lugubrious pleading on ""I've Been Thinking"" to RZA's punitive beatings on ""A Day in the Life"". How these fit under White People's thematic umbrella is a mystery. White People is adorned with a few quality tracks. Longtime Prince Paul compatriots De La Soul worship at the altar of fame on ""If It Wasn't For You"", setting their rhymes against a triumphant bobbing brassline and echoing woodwinds, while ""First... and Then"" resurrects an energetic Dres (Black Sheep), who crafts a workout routine for a night out. But these noteworthy cuts do not veil Handsome Boy's central problem: The duo seem to fit the album to its guests rather than vice versa. At the heart of this debacle lies the seven-minute colossus ""Rock and Roll (Hip-Hop Could Never Hip-Hop Like This), Pt. 2"". Bringing together such disparate characters as Lord Finesse, Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, DJ Q-Bert, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Jazzy Jay, the cut sounds more like a rework of the LP's previous material than an actual collaboration between these guests. It's like Carmen Santiago kidnapped Pharrell Williams and Jack Johnson and forced them to record an album with Rockapell at the boards. Combine pianist heartthrob Jamie Cullum and John Oates? Genius! Mike Patton and Jack Johnson got a free minute? Brilliant! Is Rahzel even on the album? Who cares?! As a result, White People, for all its ambitions, fails to coalesce. Worse, it falls victim to the flipside of MF Doom's critique: Handsome Boy Modeling School is all about the image, not about the music. ""That's the point!"" supporters might retort. ""HBSM is parodying the state of commercial hip-hop. The scene!"" Okay, but that's just starting a shitty band as a commentary on shitty bands and expecting people to respect you for it. Given Paul and Nakamura's successful outings, they possess the capability to deliver a concept album brimming with energy and solidarity. White People, unfortunately, bursts with inconsistency.","The first-ever official live document from brilliant 70s art-punks Wire is finally released on this CD/DVD set, which captures their 1979 performance on then-West Germany's ""Rockpalast"" show.

Fuzzy Warbles 5 / Fuzzy Warbles 6,Andy Partridge,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00313d19756521382a2/1:1/w_160/48bf8b90.jpg,2004-11-18 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11801-fuzzy-warbles-5fuzzy-warbles-6/,Ape House Ltd.,"These two releases mark the halfway point of Andy Partridge's Fuzzy Warbles series, a self-released collection of b-sides, four-tracks, and castoffs from both his solo career and his days with XTC. Luckily, these two most recent volumes are as random a mess as the first four. Imagine if Andy Partridge had carefully curated these Warbles albums by theme, chronology, or quality instead of just digging them out from under his bed. As it is-- even though he saved us the work of snatching up cassettes, singles, and mp3s in order to collect all of this stuff-- die-hard XTC completists still have to slog through his scattered piles. Volumes five and six are another mixed bag: About half of the tracks are demos of songs you've already heard on XTC records, but only a few are worth listening to in this form: The skiffle version of ""Dear God"" beats the portentous final version, ""Human Alchemy"" has more nervous energy and a better bass line, ""Earn Enough For Us"" actually works better in a rougher, struggling demo. Diehards will enjoy the behind-the-scenes listen to the making of ""Mermaid Smiling"", on which Partridge mocks up the arrangement at home and finds ways to beat the back of his guitar or inject white noise as he imagines the orchestrations to come. But the miracle of modern home recording allows Partridge to simulate Nonsuch's ""Rook"" and ""Omnibus"" so completely that they mirror the final versions. And speaking of inessential, do we need these (unlistenable) demos from Big Express? I buy these collections for their new material, like Fuzzy Warbles 6's Nonsuch leftovers-- the dense lyrics of buttoned-up regret on ""End Of the Pier"" and the jumbled ""Prince of Orange"", on which the keyboard riff hits as unexpectedly as a broken seconds hand. ""I Can't Tell What Truth Is Anymore"" and ""The Tiny Circus of Life"" are solid XTC tracks, and the albums are also littered with perfect ideas in half-sturdy containers: images like ""the angel that fell for me,"" from 5's ""Defy You Gravity"" deserve a more permanent home. The sixth volume, which begins and ends in laughter, has the smoothest sequencing and most consistent quality level of any Warbles collection so far. But 5 contains more revealing material, including mid-80s leftovers from Mummer, Big Express, and Skylarking. Those albums followed Partridge as he ditched the glitz and anxiety of touring to come home, and wrote more reflective songs about England, the challenge of supporting a family, and the pitfalls of marriage. On XTC's most famous record, Skylarking, he and Colin Moulding even pulled these themes into a song cycle about nothing less than the circle of life and death. But the castoffs are more intriguing. For all the songs Partridge has written about man's destruction of nature (see: Apple Venus Vol. 1), none spilled oil across more pastures than the clanking rhythms and WD-40 guitar on ""Motorcycle Landscapes"", with its seared riff and lyrics like, ""Glued up youths in high spirits throw kittens on the fire/ And down molester alley, the stabbed all roll in bliss."" By contrast, the lyrics of ""Broomstick Rhythm"" anticipate Skylarking's ""Season Cycle"", and the sweet melody describes Partridge's fall into the bliss of domesticity. Volume five actually starts with Partridge's finest rarity-- the Mummer reject ""Young Cleopatra"". It's an ecstatic portrait of a 14-year-old regent of the schoolyard, a kid who irresistably draws the boys to ""be [her] dogs."" The kids will do anything, the teachers can't look away, and Partridge shows the kind of love that lets parents pull one child out of the throng and call it special, when he sings, ""Your school uniform looks grey on others but silver on you."" When I first found the song, in an even rougher demo where you can't make out the lyrics, I actually thought Partridge was singing about his own daughter. Instead, he tells us that ""I'm glad your father is my friend/ And now that school is at an end/ He's only an excuse for me to wait here at your palace gates."" In that sense, this is a Lolita song. But it's also the purest Lolita song ever recorded. In spite of the reference to The Police's ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"", Partridge sings about the girl without lust: He's observing her from afar, celebrating her sexuality without molesting it, and what you hear in his voice is pride. And though I was wrong about his being the dad, the mistake makes more sense if you listen to the song that best complements this one-- Wasp Star's ""Playground"", on which his real daughter sings regal back-up vocals. If you spend enough time with Partridge's demos, you realize he's thrown away better songs than most people have written. He only doles out a few of them on each Warbles discs, but six discs in, it's still enough for fans to remain interested, try to figure out why he left them out, analyze what they can tell us about Partridge, and-- more than anything-- to play with them ourselves, at home, projecting our own song cycles onto these scraps.","XTC frontman offers two more volumes of B-sides, four-track recordings, demos, and castoffs.

Logic Memory Center,John Tejada,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74b13d19756521393a2/1:1/w_160/1c755881.jpg,2004-11-17 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7961-logic-memory-center/,Plug Research,"It's about damn time that techno's ongoing deconstruction befits lyrics. Consider how Kimi Recor chain-smokes her third clove and leers at a Juliet Capulet who watches a subway station's fluorescent ceiling as if bathed in divine light. ""People are such strange creatures,"" Recor purrs from the gut. ""So cold and lonely."" An acoustic bass struggles to pass through the turnstile; the ticket machines' steady clicks and bleeps serve as incidental beats. Recor then mimics Juliet's whines-- ""I was dying before I was ever born!"" Her train arrives, 10 minutes late. ""Fuck those grieving motherfuckers!"" She exhales. ""Fuck 'em all!"" That was ""Strange Creatures"", the opener for John Tejada's latest micro-glitch techno excursion, Logic Memory Center. While Recor's spat is the most subversive moment here, the L.A.-based producer still makes failures sound so gosh-darn funky. It's fitting that his 10th album is named after the crimson-lit room where HAL 9000 sang ""Daisy"" in 2001: A Space Odyssey. His melodies are best described as ""absentee melodies"" in trimming off notes to the bone. True to his beloved Detroit techno's tradition, Tejada keeps a steady drum machine thump to not distract from the groove-- letting the melodic detritus swing on the dancefloor. Comparisons to tech-house media-darling Matthew Dear are inevitable, but Tejada's sound has more fresh ideas. Although Tejada's arrangements can be too busy at times, and they often grow an acre of corn with UV-lights and hydrophonic vats. Logic's best moments are its klutziest. ""Possessive Patterns"" marches to work at 5 a.m. to a rhythm that is still fixing its socks. The Future is seen through bleary eyes as this song's muttering organs and melodies that seemed looped from commercials polluting the downtown air, all attest. ""This Fake Place"" first sounds like it's printing itself out, given its grinding noises and acid-techno synths that try to maintain a water-cooler conversation. ""Strive"" has an Akufen-style microhouse chop that gets perverted by Looney Tunes-fashioned rubber-band wonks. ""Loose Change"", uncannily produces a tap-dancing cadence that swings between guitar fragments and microtonal blips. Tejada's absentee-melodies don't always pay the bills and he should've done some quality control with his guest singers, James Figurine and Carl A. Finlow. The album closer, ""Something about the Drums"", putts along with a half-arsed, acid-synth squelch that doesn't complement a bush league house thump. Figurine delivers a cliche motivational speech on the otherwise engrossing, jazz-snap of ""Everything Will Be OK."" And then there's Finlow on ""Alone with You"", a Depeche Mode karaoke number. He drops zingers like ""Shadows forming over walls/ Catch the moonlight as it falls,"" and ""Tasting a teardrop from her cheek/ Gives me strength when I am weak."" Draw your own conclusions.","John Tejada offers more inventive minimal, deconstructionist techno on his second full-length for the Plug Research label.

The Disrupt,Oh No,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba42ea9e61561daa71ab/1:1/w_160/94ec5a79.jpg,2004-11-17 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6100-the-disrupt/,Stones Throw,"Being a little brother sucks. Just ask my youngest sib, who has to endure the nightmare of living in the shadow of the inventor of the non-fiction novel and author of The Presidential Papers. My name is Norman Mailer. (I also invented the goblin that returns your emails.) But Oh No, who coincidentally shares his real name with the other famous little bro/convict-to-be Michael Jackson, manages to rise above his elder sib Madlib's legacy and chalk one up for the bottom end of the birth order. Oh No acts as a veritable sponge, selectively absorbing the respective musical atmospheres of his contemporaries and squeezing out ample goodness. True, you get the sense that novelty is hardly Oh No's strength. At times, The Disrupt feels like Oh No's private Halloween party with each cut in fully bloomed apparel. ""Stomp That"" draws straight from the Jaylib playbook, ripe with gorilla pimp jungle thumps and the vocal intensity of a yet-to-be-quashed beef at Detroit BBQ. Likewise, ""Perceptions"" dishes a lovable, but easily imitable 70s Soul hustle as he recites standard criminal banter: ""You got dollars/ Then come make cents with me."" But Oh No deftly xeroxes and then wisely imbellishes; each recreation tantalizes with the greatness of its association while still forging a notably eclectic niche. Oh No's nimbleness on the mic is easily matched by his creativity in the booth. The Disrupt brims with an understated vibrance rarely found in a debut release. ""Seventeen"" swims in an ephemeral gloom as Oh No lends the obligatory Afterschool Special ode to the teen caught in the game. The album's opening volley, ""I'm Here"", presents Oh No's unabridged bio in less than three minutes, and does so against a sprinkle of keys and stuttering vibes. ""Life in the Ox is like life out of the Ox,"" Oh No quips about his hometown, dispelling any belief that-- despite the number of musicians it has produced-- that it's anything special. Yet thematically, The Disrupt unfortunately lives up to its name-- Oh No seems to have pitched a collection of singles rather than a cohesive album. While each individual track demonstrates his strengths, the tempo and tone of the album explodes and subsides wildly and fails to build an interpretive framework. The pixilated, frenetic crescendos of ""The Ride"" barrels headlong into Aloe Blacc's sultry vocals and escapist mantra on ""The Getaway"". Perhaps the often jarring transitions are purposeful, but the gaps are still distracting and prevent the album from delivering closure. Nonetheless, the son of soulman Otis Jackson and nephew of trumpetist Jon Faddis proudly revists his fam's talented crest. And what's more, The Disrupt adds another gold star to Stones Throw's heavily adorned jacket.","Madlib's little brother proves that talent and skill run in this Oaktown family.

Turn,The Ex,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc4c0084474cd0c2b67/1:1/w_160/7e6d43de.jpg,2004-11-17 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2861-turn/,Touch and Go,"There is an intangible quality that defines truly vital music, something that spans genres and trends and makes itself felt as the sound passes through you. It could be a perfect confluence of notes and timbres or a brilliantly conveyed sentiment, but it could also really be anything. It's not one of those things you can put into effective words-- you just know it when you hear it. And to me, The Ex make vital music. For 25 years, the Dutch band have nipped at the fringe of post-punk, steering stridently clear of corporate-owned record labels and lighting up the left side of the political spectrum with more than a dozen albums proudly splattered with anarcho-syndicalist and anti-consumerist sentiment. But they're not just shouting about trade unionism, materialist greed, and the inherent contradictions of modern free-market societies; they can bring the noise, too, and their polemics come wrapped in a blistering package of smoldering art-punk informed by free jazz and global folk. On their latest album, Turn, they elevate their craft to near perfection over the course of two wild, unpredictable, and unforgettable discs. The bulk of the songs that comprise Turn hew to The Ex's peculiar brand of crushing, dense post-punk, but the music can veer on a dime into spoken satire, Eritrean freedom songs, and savage improvisation. Steve Albini returns to the boards for them on this album, and nobody captures The Ex better than he does-- the sound is dry and caustic, allergic to reverb, as heavy as Shellac, and relentlessly intense. The band's setup is extremely basic-- guitar, standup bass, and drums-- but they wring a lot out of it, particularly the bass. The instrument is amplified and then scraped, beaten, sawed, and distorted, alternately used to create an annihilating low-end and to emulate electronic effects or panicked voices. The drums are mixed high for maximum damage and principle vocalist GW Sok-- who doesn't sing so much as rant-- winds up somewhere near the middle of it all, a voice caught in a hellstorm of overdriven guitar, unable to control his surroundings but forced to comment on them through a sense of duty. Sok runs himself breathless on the brilliant opener ""Listen to the Painters"", clipping syllables in the mantra ""We need poets, we need painters/ We need poets, we need painters/ We need poetry and paintings,"" and his sense of English wordplay is better than that of a lot of native speakers: ""Sheep with crazy leaders/ Heading for disaster/ Courting jesters who take themselves for masters/ The shrub who took himself for a park/ The squeak who took himself for a bark."" The churning guitars and daisy cutter bass tears a hole in the crust of the earth from which Sok's frenetic second verse can pour. He takes his wordplay to incredible satirical heights on ""The Pie"", which opens with a genuinely demented reading of a recipe for sweet potato pie that, as it turns out, is being baked for the purpose of smashing it in the face of authority. Sok piles puns on top of vitriol with the lines ""In a world full of poor and an environment to protect/ An alternative flan of action flies in the face of promises not kept/ It shows that the responsible irresponsibles have faces and names which can be addressed/ Therefore bake and aim and put a smile back on the faces of the oppressed"" as the band rages beneath him; there is darkness at the heart of this humor. The band uses the two-disc format to offer the listener a break-- 90 straight minutes of caustic, melody-averse art punk is a lot to take in-- and they intentionally place the album's most violent, punishing, exhilarating track, ""Theme from Konono"", at the beginning of disc two, right next to ""Huriye"", which is both a cover of an Eritrean protest song from their fight for independence from Ethiopia and the most beautifully melodic song on the record. ""Theme from Konono"" is basically a summary of everything the Ex do best, building over the course of several minutes from scratchy guitar interplay into a full-on juggernaut of barreling rhythm. The song piles tension upon tension, building and tightening until it's almost unbearable, finally blowing open with a pounding beat and lockstep guitar riffs and then slowly re-upping the ante. Based on an assault like this, you'd never guess any of these people are over 40. About the only bands from punk's original era that are still as bracing and original as The Ex are Wire and The Fall. What's truly amazing about Turn is how colossal, how ingenious, how vital it sounds. Just about any of the current post-punk crop sound downright milquetoast when put up against The Ex's vibrant assault and well-considered commentary. On ""Listen to the Painters"", The Ex remind us of the need for poets and painters and builders and dancers and writers-- by the end of the album, it's clear we need The Ex, too.","Latest full-length from these long-running jagged Dutch punk vets is an ambitious double-disc set-- and crazily, at 25 years into their career, it may be their best.

R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece,Snoop Dogg,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68db1335d7bf1698e5c/1:1/w_160/ed5d4769.jpg,2004-11-17 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7788-rg-rhythm-gangsta-the-masterpiece/,GeffenStar Trak,"Snoop Dogg is old. He's not the same kid who turned up out of nowhere on ""Deep Cover"". He no longer possesses that menacing lean, that cool, dangerous charisma, that effortless way of just rapping through the beat like he was always a part of it and it was always a part of him. These days, he's that haggard-looking, vaguely creepy middle-ager who was in Starsky & Hutch, the ""P.I.M.P."" video, and some pornos. He's always hanging out with that pimp bishop guy. He says ""wizzle wizzle"" a lot. He comes out with an album every couple of years, and no one pays any attention because Dr. Dre doesn't have anything to do with it. Finally, with R&G;: The Masterpiece, Snoop seems to have realized he's not getting younger. Unfortunately, he's tackled this dilemma by recording lots of terrible seductive soul tracks. R&G; (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece is absolutely crammed with them-- a nearly endless amount (18 songs, 78 minutes). ""I want to get you alone so I can learn you a little better,"" he purrs on ""Stay"". ""Everything is beautiful/ Right down to ya cuticles,"" he coos on ""Perfect"". ""Flip the channel to Lifetime/ You stay on my mind even when I write rhymes,"" he growls on ""Promise I"". But somehow, it's hard to take Snoop's appreciation of the opposite sex seriously when the second track on the album, ""Can You Control Ya Hoe"", advocates violence against women more brutally than anything he's done since ""Bitches Ain't Shit"". But girl, you can watch Lifetime! R&G; is Snoop's first album for Star Trak, the label run by fallen-off hip-hop hitmakers the Neptunes, a duo who all but ruled international radio with dazzling sci-fi stomp-clap new wave beats, but who've been starving for hits ever since they switched up their style to overcooked Vegas schmaltz-- all bloopy bass and shuffling drums and swooshing keyboards and unbelievably obnoxious falsetto crooning. The production duo laced five of this album's songs, but their fingerprints are everywhere else here. R&G; has a unified sound, rare in hip-hop albums, but it's a sound based on tinkly pianos and noodly guitars and windchimes. It sounds something like The Black Eyed Peas if they tried to make a Barry White album, but with more falsetto warbling. Snoop's voice is still a cool, gravelly drawl, but he doesn't insinuate himself into the beat the way he once did. He pretty much just talks over the beats, seemingly barely aware of their presence. On their respective guest spots, Nelly and Daz easily outshine him. Snoop only comes to life on a handful of rough, club-friendly tracks, most notably ""Step Yo Game Up"", a Lil' Jon production that sounds just like circa-2000 Neptunes. It's one of the few moments on the album in which he sounds like a real adult, and not just a sad old man, washed up and worn down.","Remember when Snoop jumped to No Limit just as that ship was sinking? This Star Trak release is, quite sadly, a little like that. And of course, its title is awfully misleading.

Wire on the Box 1979,Wire,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa57ea9e61561daa5b9f/1:1/w_160/376e3a88.jpg,2004-11-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8714-wire-on-the-box-1979/,Pinkflag,"The iconic London Calling cover shot-- Paul Simonon smashing his white bass-- stems from frustration. Not frustration at The Man or over crusty, narrow-minded punks accusing The Clash of selling out, but frustration over the audience response. Simonon was upset that a crowd at New York City's Palladium was made to remain seated, effectively eliminating the crowd/band synergy The Clash had worked so hard to perfect. Opening bands know this feeling well, and it must be incredibly difficult to play a great show if the audience is having no visible reaction to your music. Watching the DVD portion of Wire's Wire on the Box, I was struck by the band's energy and passion in the face of a very nearly inert crowd. In an hour-long set filmed for (then-West) Germany's ""Rockpalast"" television program, the band are tight, focused, even demented in their intensity at times, but partly because of the rules in the television studio: the tiny audience scarcely budges, and only claps politely between numbers. The audience is only four rows deep, and they're sitting on benches. Some audience members even look confused when the camera pans their faces between songs, as if they weren't sure what to expect from a Wire show. Then again, perhaps you can't hold that against them; Wire were a notoriously unpredictable live act in their heyday, and nine of the songs they played in this set hadn't yet been released at the time. Those songs that were new in February 1979 eventually became the bulk of Wire's third album, 154. But even as the band demoed them for live European audiences that spring (opening for Roxy Music, no less), they sounded fully formed, differing only from their studio versions in density and texture. That Wire were already hitting audiences with new material hot on the heels of their 1978 sophomore opus Chairs Missing is indicative of the kind of band they were and always have been, i.e. never dwelling on the past and constantly evolving. That unrelenting flux is also what makes Wire on the Box an odd release in the band's catalog. It's the second live recording to be released from Wire's original phase, but the first one, 1981's Document & Eyewitness felt like another step forward for the band (if at times an utterly confounding one), whereas this one is uncharacteristically retrospect, a sort of ""Greatest Hits Live"" album. That said, if Wire felt the need to throw fans a traditional archival bone, they certainly could have done a lot worse. The performance here is spot-on and the sound is spectacularly clear, though I'd argue that the vocals are mixed a tad too high, which distances them somewhat from the guitars. And the packaging conceit is a brilliant one that should be employed more often: the hour-long show is available to watch on DVD (along with a mumbly but informative 20-minute interview with the band), but also appears in its entirety on a separate CD so that it can be listened to as an album, without the video feed. That makes it a more versatile release, allowing you to enjoy the music on its own terms or to take in the spectacle of late-70s German television with the goofy prog-rock ""Rockpalast"" logo and seemingly arbitrary camerawork that quickly cuts from shots of all four band members to close-ups of Colin Newman's facial pores. Newman is in brilliant voice for the set, shouting, yelping, and singing with ecstatic abandon. He and bassist Graham Lewis occasionally acknowledge their meager audience or give the title of a new song, but otherwise, the lackluster assortment in front of them might as well be in another time zone-- you'd think they were playing Wembley the way they confidently range across material from their early output, dishing out a killer take on the Pink Flag title track and a stunning, breathtaking version of Chairs Missing's ""Heartbeat"". They're clearly most content with the new material, though, ripping through 154 gems like ""The 15th"" and ""Two People in a Room"", as well as giving the full apocalyptic treatment to the epic noise wall ""A Touching Display"", on which Bruce Gilbert's processed bass sears a quasi-melody that I'd previously imagined to have come from a guitar. More than anything else, this set highlights how singular and amazing Wire were at their peak. They could be flattening and catchy at once, and they were a visual oddity, with skinny-tied Newman and Lewis swirling wildly between drummer Robert Gotobed, who looks almost robotic, and Gilbert, who I swear never looks away from his guitar for all 58 minutes. And what makes the quality and ferocity of the show all the more impressive is the circumstances: How they mustered this much energy and focus for such a wallflower crowd I'll never know, but the end result is an excellent document of an essential band at the height of their powers.","The first-ever official live document from brilliant 70s art-punks Wire is finally released on this CD/DVD set, which captures their 1979 performance on then-West Germany's ""Rockpalast"" show.

B EP,Battles,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1035e6ef959693200bd/1:1/w_160/21d6e9d9.jpg,2004-11-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1120-b-ep/,Dim Mak,"Battles may boast, ""We've got Ian Williams of Don Caballero on guitar"", but it's a musical bait and switch: They're not math rock. In fact, the instrumental four-piece band confines itself to relatively conventional time signatures on its third EP, B, a record steeped in heavy funk and craggy post-rock. But let's not beat around the bush-- Williams is still a guitar powerhouse and, placed alongside the reliably inventive Tyondai Braxton, plus David Konopka's guitar work and John Stanier's striated drum grooves, he's infallible-- like Barry Bonds in a lineup that won't let you pitch around him. Battles thrive on the energy of a group of musicians being dead-aim tight, synced to the point where it almost doesn't matter what they're playing. Their instruments are tuned to be as crisp and dry as possible, reducing the margin for error within their playing. Without the gloss of overtones, every misstep leaves a glaring red tracer; amazingly, such marks are rarely seen on B, and when one is, it's so faint that it could pass for a deliberate impression (a staggered flam, for instance). Virtuosic playing aside, Battles' guitar sounds are unlike those of most of their contemporaries. Placed in a more conventional sonic setting, these songs could take on an entirely different texture, but as such they're exhilaratingly off-kilter. Williams, Braxton, and Konopka sound hazy and low-res, only without the static and hissing that accompanies many poor quality recordings. Alternately guttural and glistening, ""SZ2"" opens in a formless haze of fingerings before falling into a pensive, slightly shuffled melody. In contrast to the totemic EP C, Battles here sound acquiescent, as if they're stepping down from the groove-heavy jams of that record into more texture-based territory. But then Stanier enters with an impossibly huge drum fill, splintering the subdued mood and booting the song awake. The ensuing seven minutes are B's strongest. Battles are impressive musicians, but the real key to these songs is restraint, and ""SZ2"" presents its selling points in a humble manner that amounts to a vastly greater whole. Unlike in Don Cab, Williams' polymathic high-wire acts are understated; they play a foundational role. Meanwhile, Stanier pounds tight-wound grooves that handle big dynamics with phenomenal sensitivity. That one-two punch is the crux of ""SZ2"", which at first taunts and pounds its chest, then backs off, performs a quick turnabout, and skitters away in lithe 3-against-4 trot. This record is a companion to this summer's Tras and EP C, and its five songs explore, hone, and paraphrase material from those two releases. Like minimalist composers, the band work in subtle variations, treating previously recorded songs as constantly evolving entities. ""TRAS3"" isolates the girding guitar riff from Tras's title track, and bathes it in echo, creating a nice arrhythmic segue after the unrelenting nine-minute opener. ""IPT2"" intercepts a track of the same name from EP C, removing its heavily processed drums. ""Dance"" is a strong closer; it has another insistent Stanier drum loop and vamps on an organ melody that sounds like a twisted seventh-inning stretch. Battles' Achilles' heel is their penchant for abstruseness, witnessed here by ""BTTLS"", a plodding ambient collage built of fragmented, heavily-processed percussion clips and a smattering of tinny, modem-like squalls. At 12 minutes, the song has plenty of time to find its stride, but never really manages to do so.

Sleep and Wake Up Songs EP,Okkervil River,by: Stephen Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b09d034d5c69bf52a2/1:1/w_160/39ec99e0.jpg,2004-11-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5962-sleep-and-wake-up-songs-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"Okkervil River write dreamy songs with slumber-blurred stories and play them with a drifting, somnambulant gait. The band-- named for a river outside St. Petersburg, Russia-- filled last year's eye-opening Down the River of Golden Dreams with gentle ballads about beds and war criminals and forgiveness, but the songs on their follow-up EP, Sleep and Wake Up Songs, are more brittle and fragile, like a light sleeper's snooze. The EP condenses the album's best qualities and discards most of its weaknesses, and its brevity makes it all the more emotionally forceful. ""Rapt, in Star Wars sheets/ With my hand across your belly/ We waded through the watercolor,"" Will Sheff sings on opener ""A Favor"". The song hints at a life of sexual confusion and parental abandonment, hinging on a chorus that alludes to the impossibility of true human connection: ""I would be anything that you wanted me to be...but how can I change my body?"" Plumbing the disappointment of unrealized dreams, these songs are bleak and often desperate. They traffic in deliberately nebulous narratives-- unnamed characters, unspecified relationships, vague actions, undisclosed emotions-- anchored by concrete details. The result is a dreamlike atmosphere, simultaneously blurred and lucid. ""You're Untied Again"" turns the adage ""if you love something, set it free"" on its head, but Sheff is more interested in evoking the chill of an unreachable beach or the darkness of a diamond mine-- both of which become potent metaphors for the confinement of a relationship. With an acoustic guitar melody as prismatic as melting icicles, ""Just Give Me Time"" plumbs the tension at the heart of a relationship, but the lyrics are so opaque as to be coded: ""I shut my eyes, ripped the train off the line/ But a sudden gust of snow blew through a hole in my girl's clothes."" This is not necessarily a criticism: refusing to provide much context for their narratives, these songs are guardedly confessional, eager to elicit emotions but hesitant to reveal too much. To compliment this mood, the instruments sound sleepily languid, lolling around the beat rather than hitting it precisely. ""A Favor"" builds gradually to a climax reminiscent of ""The War Criminal Rises and Speaks"" from Down the River of Golden Dreams, but only the vocals crescendo. The other instruments maintain the same volume, as if nonplussed by Sheff's display of emotion. As a result, the song's climax becomes airily anticlimactic, further emphasizing the sense of lonely futility described in the lyrics. Closing the EP, ""The Hidden Track"" sets up an intriguing musical metaphor: Life itself is an album, but the afterlife is the unlisted bonus song. After questioning and doubting himself throughout the song-- and suffering through what sounds like tremendous uncertainty-- Sheff admits, ""I think that there's a hidden track."" The song provides an upbeat coda to match his hopefulness, then the EP abruptly and unceremoniously ends.","Okkervil River write dreamy songs with slumber-blurred stories and play them with a drifting, somnambulant gait.

Barbez,Barbez,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a471b1335d7bf1698972/1:1/w_160/5605ebf0.jpg,2004-11-16 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1140-barbez/,Important,"Some bands, intentionally or not, overwhelm the reviewer with talking points; one unfortunate side effect of this is that all their reviews sound the same. Allow me to illustrate: nobody has ever written 10 words about Franz Ferdinand without five of them being ""archduke,"" ""assassination"", and ""First World War."" Consider, then, Brooklyn's Barbez, a mainstay of the John Zorn-impacted downtown NYC scene and recent signees to Important Records: (1) Their frontwoman is a Russian avant-garde dancer, (2) They have a theremin, (3) The theremin is not used for whooshy space sounds but actually played by a cigarette-smoking waif virtuoso who makes it sound like an entire string section, (4) They cover Kurt Weill, (5) and Schnittke, (6) They lug around a monstrous marimba, and (7) A band member coaxes scratches and squiggles out of a Palm Pilot via a proprietary piece of software. As you may imagine, every attempt at describing Barbez devolves into ritual recitation of these factoids in random order, and before you know it, your allotted 500 words are over. So let's talk about the music, then. The songs oscillate from tra-la-la chanson to brief explosions of terrifying skronk, hitting everything in between. Although sometimes flamboyant with mid-song tempo and time signature changes, Barbez don't come across as mathy: they're going for controlled chaos, not athletics. The impression is that of a century's worth of vinyl disintegrating in a cellar-- Satie melting into The Stooges-- then somehow willing itself back together. ""The Defiant Bicycle"", the centerpiece of the album and most of their live performances, is a gorgeous suite that takes so much time to build that the listener's masochistic response (per Masoch's definition of masochism, as delayed pleasure) almost becomes a counterpoint. ""Wisconsin""-- songwriter and bandleader Dan Kaufman's ode to his surprisingly prosaic birthplace-- is the closest Barbez come to a traditional lied (via the Residents, perhaps). The band's self-titled debut on Important is, in fact, their third album (before employing the blonde tornado named Ksenia Vidyaykina, they were fronted by a man with an uncanny Nick Cave bellow, which made the Weimar fetish come through stronger but shaved off some originality points). They've been playing some of the album's songs since 1999; as a result, there's a honed, easy dexterity to the entire performance. Producer Martin Bisi, who's made his name recording Swans and early Sonic Youth, appears less to have produced the album than to have captured it; it's recorded and mixed like a jazz LP-- grounded in a well-defined, specific room, without dramatic panning and loads of what sounds like natural basement reverb. All theremin-and-Weill trivia aside, what's rather intriguing about Barbez is that a band like this would never come out of the Parisian neighborhood from which its name derives; it also couldn't have possibly emerged from any of the countries whose music and perceived ambience it references/absorbs/bites-- namely Russia, Hungary, or Poland. The sound of Barbez is driven by a distinctly American strain of Europhilia. In a cultural moment when thinking East Coasters are swept up in a bizarre cross-Atlantic camaraderie, borne of the shared November 3rd funk (one entry on sorryeverybody.com: ""Apologies from Isle of New York, off the coast of Europe""), Barbez provide a pitch-perfect soundtrack to the intelligentsia identity crisis.","This self-titled release is the third album from Barbez, a mainstay of the John Zorn-impacted downtown NYC scene.

The Gris Gris,The Gris Gris,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c00b5e6ef959693234bd/1:1/w_160/de001a1b.gif,2004-11-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3658-the-gris-gris/,Birdman,"Thanks to the recent success of such diverse tonebenders as Sunburned Hand of the Man, The Major Stars, Black Forest/Black Sea, Comets on Fire, Six Organs of Admittance, and the bands in the Jewelled Antler collective, ""psychedelic"" pops up everywhere and nowhere: The descriptor encompasses one too many stylistic paths to function as anything more than a meaningless catch phrase. Unlike the easily corralled fuzz addicts ensconced in the monolithic grunge pantheon, you really ought to modify ""psych"" to make it work. Enter The Gris Gris. They don't wrap their music in nature-friendly drone, the white-eyed haze of noisy star-melting sprawl, or the autumnal cartwheels of lo-fi acid-folk; instead, they drape themselves in classy, gauzy atmospherics that gurgle with small-scale, somehow gentle freak-outs and downcast hooks. The Gris Gris are Bay Area residents but their take on the 60s is miles apart from most of San Francisco's candle melting mystics. The band's Oakland-via-Texas frontman Greg Ashley is more Musician magazine magpie than Harry Partch channeler. Tellingly, while the band's name does connote a so-called ""iron-fisted"" form of voodoo ceremonials, the more earthbound Ashley grabbed the term from Dr. John's first record rather than a magic talisman. Recorded on an 8-track machine with half-inch tape in a three-room cement basement, the strongest aspect of this debut is its authentic mustiness. The group bows at a dark pantheon-- the spirits of Roky Erickson, The Electric Prunes, Velvet Underground, Syd Barrett, and The Rolling Stones all make appearances. Staying closer to the present, consider The Gris Gris a less cryptically insular Brother JT with a penchant for Galaxie 500. Unlike their forefathers' black-lit laboratories, the quartet often feels emotionally vacant. It's not that the words are fatuous, clunky, embarrassing, or overwrought-- they just kinda are. Even during Ashley's most baroquely reverb-bathed lamentations, he best locates his emotional mojo in his guitar pick rather than his run-of-the-mill sentiments. This isn't necessary a death-knell; the fluidity of his musicality is detailed enough to fill those gaps with a squall of melancholy sounds: minor chords, rapturous feedback, ghostly organ. But, hey, as Extreme wisely put it back in the day, sometimes other things can be more valuable than words. For instance, Ashley and crew possess the skills to uncover pleasing results when they wander over hills of non-vocal music. There, some of The Gris-Gris' compositions are allowed the space to ramble: The eight-plus minute ""Raygun"" could continue the lonesome path of its first two minutes ad infinitum if Ashley felt the need; instead, it rocks loose from a This Is Our Music guitar/voice jangle, raising a bubbling, flanging ruckus, like an crumbling aircraft ascending from a rusted silo. It's the sonic equivalent of a contact mic making out with a jar of silly string. ""Me Queda Um Bejou"" opens with a bluster until it drops a step and becomes a lovely Portuguese enchanter, a moody blue come-on that, at its midpoint, slides along a melodic saxophone. The incidental piece, ""Plain Vanilla"", blends castanets and string plucks to create windy circus music trapped in a hurricane. ""Best Regards"" flinches and fizzles with the nervous energy of The 13th Floor Elevators until Ashley begins some sort of dark cloud exorcism to the fore-- and, again, once he stops talking, the guitar theatrics really take off, this time screeching, drilling, and howling over a tight, distant rhythm section. But in the end, even those pale, cascading salvos just aren't enough to sustain interest. A number of tunes glisten, but as you grow familiar with the aura, the more it fades. Ultimately, I want to loop the best moments and pretend Ashley doesn't return to break what's left of the spell. A songwriter needn't be a literary lion but in this case, the lack of a back story, esoteric insight, charmed charisma, or soothsayer actualization renders The Gris Gris, more or less, a solid bar band with a great list of influences.","Unlike most of today's neo-psych bands, Bay Area residents The Gris Gris drape their music in sophisticated, gauzy atmospherics that gurgle with small-scale, somehow gentle freak-outs and downcast hooks.

Rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003),Pearl Jam,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01f5e6ef9596931fe9e/1:1/w_160/bada01bd.jpg,2004-11-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6209-rearviewmirror-greatest-hits-1991-2003/,Sony,"As many others have done this year, the other night I went to see the Pixies' reunion tour. Next week, the Nirvana box set is finally released, as is a new two-disc expanded version of Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral; Low's upcoming Sub Pop record kicks off with a track whose rhythm section and vocal melody sound like a miniature version of Alice in Chains; Q magazine named The Red Hot Chili Peppers the Best Act in the World Today at its 2004 awards show; TV commercials for Green Day's American Idiot reminds us that 10 years ago they released Dookie; and now Pearl Jam are lionized with the two-disc, 33-track, best-of album, Rearviewmirror. I'd be frightened that we're about to undergo a full-blown 90s alternarock revival-- an era depressingly and backhandedly praised as much for what it was not (e.g. the hair metal that it ""kicked out,"" or the nu-metal that some of it slowly morphed into) than the music it produced. But then, it never went away, did it? In recent years, Billy Corgan's Zwan, a reunited Jane's Addiction, the Scott Weiland-fronted Velvet Revolver, and the Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine mashup Audioslave have released records to varying degrees of commercial success. Prior to that, the nascent sounds of grunge remained among the dominant North American hard rock templates throughout the 90s and into this decade, living on in a lineage that extended from its Seattle roots through Bush and Candlebox to Creed and Nickleback. Oddly, Pearl Jam have remained a constant since the days when 120 Minutes graduated to Alternative Nation, transitioning from stadium fillers to one of American rock's largest and most beloved cult bands, a Grateful Dead for the great washed. After deftly turning their backs on fame just as much of the public seemed poised to turn on them, Pearl Jam cultivated the unwavering support of a cabal of devotees who followed the band across a string of studio albums that casual observers have likely forgotten-- No Code, Yield, Binaural, and Riot Act-- and the almost comical release of every live show from their 2000 tour, a move that, depending on your level of cynicism, was either a thank you or an unintentional fuck you to their lemmingesque fanbase. Musically, Pearl Jam slightly spiced up their sound over the course of a decade, adding a few Eastern-tinged delicacies and some garage-rock snackfood to their typical meat-and-potatoes diet. By the time Creed became a permanent fixture on late-90s rock radio, the Florida band sounded as much like Pearl Jam as, well, Pearl Jam themselves. Rearviewmirror divides the band's career into an ""up side"" and a ""down side""-- the former are the earnest rockers, the latter are the earnest ballads-- although the monikers would also have been appropriate had they arranged the record chronologically. The ""down side"" to Pearl Jam's career allowed many people to romanticize the group's shift away from the spotlight as one purely of choice, and the band has since been characterized by honesty, good intentions, and yeoman's work, the sort of qualities that often make for turgid, sometimes rote, faceless music. In truth, Pearl Jam were always planted squarely in the middle of the road. While Nirvana was characterized by punk's sound as much as its ethos, Soundgarden had one foot in contemporary metal, Smashing Pumpkins mixed 80s goth and new wave in with their glam, and Green Day, NIN, and the RHCP were clearly creatures of the post-punk era, Pearl Jam was always a classic rock band, the one alt-nation superstar that completely ignored both punk and its aftermath. Pearl Jam were all solos and riffs and lighters-aloft, arena-rock sentiment; like so many 60s rockers, they looked to the Asian sub-continent for their first flirtations with ""growth"" and ""maturity""; they even cuddled up to the ""right"" rock 'n' roll architects (Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Neil Young). To claim Pearl Jam as the greatest rock band of our time-- as many listeners and critics do-- is virtually a negation of the past 30 years of guitar-based music, a relieved sigh that the values of the 70s aren't completely lost. And... that works for a lot of people. Pearl Jam struck chords within listeners like few of their contemporaries. Those diehards probably looked at the Rearviewmirror tracklist and chuckled, wondering why it didn't include this rarity or that B-side (it does have a few key ones, e.g. ""Yellow Ledbetter"") or a handful of what the album rock stations used to call ""deep cuts."" This comp isn't for them, though; it's for the rest of us, and a lot of listeners will likely glance at it, wonder where the hell ""Crazy Mary"" is, and consider it a handy career-spanner-- all the Pearl Jam they'll ever need. If they buy it, those listeners will likely be surprised that-- despite some non-descript titles (""Corduroy"", ""Go"", ""Immortality"", the title track)-- they remember most of these tracks, and despite slipping well below the radar, the band has, in many ways, improved over the years. The record seemingly begins the same way as their debut, Ten, but this version of ""Once"" (like ""Alive"" and ""Black"") has been slightly re-mixed by Brendan O'Brien. Hardly radical and barely noticeable, the new versions buff the shine from the originals, actually improving three of the band's better, more melodic early tracks. On the album's first disc, the band's years of popularity-- through third album Vitalogy-- are only highlighted by the Singles track ""State of Love and Trust"" and the forceful ""Not For You"". A lot of the other big guns are better left unremembered: The five-against-one mutterings of ""Animal""; ""Evenflow"", ""Rearviewmirror"", and ""Go"" plod along, monuments to the appropriateness of the tag ""grunge""; ""Spin the Black Circle"" is their first step toward the clumsy romanticism of bygone days; and ""Jeremy"" remains as painful as ever. Perhaps that last track is only truly powerful when coupled with images of Vedder's emotive pantomimes, hard-scrawled title cards that say things like ""the serpent was subtil [sic]"" and ""90210"", or a shirtless boy both wrapped in the American flag and standing in front of a wall of flames and crouching in the woods in front of an overblown photo of a teeth-baring fox... On the up side, the garage-esque ""Do the Evolution"" is either over-the-top fun or completely ridiculous, depending on whether or not you believe Pearl Jam actually possess a sense of humor (in this case, I think it's the former), and ""I Got Shit"" (formerly ""I Got ID""), ""Save You"", and ""Hail, Hail"" have a few more shades than the gray of the band's grunge era. On the way down, things are also scattered. Like they do on the early rockers, Vedder's vocal diversions, tics, and lack of enunciation occasionally move from exaggerated emoting into self-parody (see, in particular, ""Given to Fly""). His voice is still the band's hallmark sound-- a mealy-mouthed, gravely style that influenced a decade of really, really shitty music-- and it's still fun to impersonate; unfortunately, on pain-wracked attempts to convey more universal emotions (the glib ""Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town"", the lyrical disaster ""Wishlist"", ""Better Man"", the awkward cover of ""Last Kiss""), it's not very fun to listen to. Even when Eddie's opening his mouth, the tunes are often excruciatingly drab dirges-- ""Immortality"" and ""Nothingman"" are the biggest offenders. (Yet ironically, the most overtly dirge-like track-- the almost mantra-esque, Eastern-tinged ""Who You Are""-- is one of the set's most effective.) Elsewhere, the patient ""Off He Goes"", ""Nothing As It Seems"", and ""Man of the Hour"" and the solipsistic ""I Am Mine"" all carry a more weathered, wise sense of self, and these tracks greatly upstage the more youthful and clumsy neo-emoisms of the band's better known songs-- in particular its ballads. In some ways, it makes sense that Pearl Jam are improving as they slip further from the gaze of contemporary listeners and into the neolithic caves of mid-70s classic rock. For all the harm it unwittingly did to rock radio-- and for as comical as it can be in its most unchecked moments-- Vedder's voice is powerful and can even be captivating. The more considered and time-tested tones it now carries fit the band's more subtle shading. In full ham-fisted stadium rock mode, Pearl Jam now oddly seem miles away from Nirvana, still the best of their one-time Seattle contemporaries. Instead, they're not-so-distant cousins to the denim brigade, the faceless 70s arena rockers who dutifully punched time clocks and produced no-nonsense, sometimes hook-filled rock. Today, Pearl Jam seems bruised, ever so slightly more adventurous, and, thanks to the devotion of their fans, they're afforded the chance to dress up as rock iconoclasts rather than take a slide toward VH1-ready adult contemporary balladry. It's like punk never happened.","Pearl Jam-- one of the last bands standing from both the grunge and alternarock movements-- are lionized with this two-disc, 33-track career-spanning compilation.

Black Holes in the Sand,Gravenhurst,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bff6ea9e61561daa7b3a/1:1/w_160/2eb219e4.jpg,2004-11-15 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3641-black-holes-in-the-sand/,Warp,"When Warp records released Gravenhurst's Flashlight Seasons earlier this year, the release was unfairly raked beneath 2004's already unwieldy pile of avant-folk artifacts, despite the fact that the lineage of Nick Talbot's atmospheric songcraft could more accurately be traced back through bands like The Smiths or Slint than to established folk sources. So now, months later, Talbot and his Gravenhurst mates return with Black Holes in the Sand, an ambitious EP on which they plunge headlong into more traditional folk themes and styles, almost as if to say ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em."" Containing six songs and running just over 30 minutes ling, Black Holes in the Sand is just a whisker shy of what was once known as an album. While previous Gravenhurst records have essentially been solo affairs, here Talbot is joined throughout by drummer Dave Collingwood and instrumentalist Paul Nash. Their collective sound remains spare, however, and it's still unmistakably Talbot's show, and on these songs his talents are given ample opportunity to flourish in the limelight. The track which best typifies Gravenhurst's increased emphasis on tradition is ""Flowers in Her Hair"". Over exquisite Bert Jansch-like fingerpicking, Talbot tells the haunting tale of a young woman, burned by her townspeople as a witch, whose ghost returns to seek a little good old-fashioned payback. ""Everyone you know/ Will be crawling through the snow/ At the four furthest corners of town/ Where they buried my bones,"" he sings as just the sparest hints of feedback provide the appropriate degree of wintry wind. It's a spellbinding performance, and a song that harkens back powerfully to the olde English ballads collected by Francis James Child. Elsewhere, on songs like the title track or ""Winter Moon"", Talbot holds forth on our modern disconnect with the natural world-singing of mountains, trees, and frozen fields while ""In our rooms beside the fire/ We drink unaware of all nature's forces in our lives."" On these tracks he permits the occasional instrumental indulgence-- like a warm patch of droning organ or crisp electric guitar jangle-- to intrude upon his otherwise pristine vocals and acoustic guitar. (His pearly voice is in such mint condition here that its lack of burrs or scratches almost becomes a distraction on some of the EP's more emotive numbers.) About the only track that doesn't work is the recasting of Husker Du's ""Diane"" as a gentle acoustic murder ballad. Though this cover may sound like a slam-dunk on paper, it falls irretrievably flat in practice, as Grant Hart's blunt lyrics (""We could cruise down Robert Street all night long/ I think I'll just rape you and kill you instead"") sound hopelessly unpoetic when shorn of the rabid electricity which buried them on Metal Circus. Closing the record is the pleasant but uneventful instrumental ""Flashlight Seasons"", on which guitar feedback and organ blend to end matters with a polite nod towards Talbot's old Bristol faves Flying Saucer Attack. It's an unexpectedly demure finale, and one that feels quite anti-climatic after Blacks Holes in the Sand has hit such charged heights of intensity. And when finished, it can't help but leave you wondering whether or not we've yet been allowed the best vantage point to witness the varied aspects of Gravenhurst's still-splintered personality.","When Warp records released Gravenhurst's Flashlight Seasons earlier this year, the release was unfairly raked beneath 2004's already ...

The Commercial Album: 25th Anniversary Edition,The Residents,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26113d1975652138863/1:1/w_160/d2637614.jpg,2004-11-15 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6766-the-commercial-album-25th-anniversary-edition/,RalphRalph,"The Commercial Album is a more of an excuse than satire. Its premise: commercial jingles are the soundtrack to modern life. Such memes of social control are never more than a minute long. Therefore, The Residents concocted 40 one-minute ditties-- technically ""commercial[s]."" Never mind that the iconic, San Francisco freak-show rockers sell nothing and rarely implant Pavlovian bells in consumer minds. But then again, their giant eyeball masks, top hats, and tuxes could never explain their career-mothering notion of ""phonetic organization."" That's Amerikun Dadaism for ya. Mute recently reissued this train that, when it was first released in 1980, barely skidded off the track. Also included is a booklet of lyrics and rather awkward-looking CG art from its admirable DVD edition's 56 music videos from various prey of The Residents' spell. Special note: the Residents directed what are supposedly the earliest music videos, for Commercial. Some of them are on permanent display at New York's Museum of Modern Art. If anything, The Residents usually create the perfect soundtrack for fever dreams. During that condition, to stare at a pile of dirty clothes or one's moonlit shadow is to trigger delusions about living among beasts. The Residents' grotesqueries follow the same logic-- although their creations are oddly adorable like the creatures that inhabit Edward Gorey's ""Utter Zoo Alphabet"". To sit through Commercial's 40 synthesizer'n'piecemeal percussion tunes of carnival barker serenades, bedeviled Zappa jaunts, Babylonian cabaret, and bastardized Chinese operas may disturb the stomach. It is arguably the Residents' last great album before descending into 15 years of desperate weird for weirdness' sake pretension. As mentioned before, nothing here remotely resembles a ""commercial"" for anything-- their last product placement was for Coca-Cola in their 1979 ethnodelic masterpiece Eskimo, where their Westernized Aleutian characters bleated ""Coca Cola adds life!"" Given Commercial's volume, it's inevitably hit-or-miss-- although these poor sods should be immunized from falling in love. Witness their lopsided tap-dance number, ""Love Is..."" where they robotically chant, ""Love is only loneliness divided by another love is only living for the lonely love is only loneliness divided by another and I know that life is lonely."" Whomever in the anonymous band sings is either a nasally congested, good 'ol boy or a female music teacher for second-graders. They best gel in the Hee Haw Chinese opera of ""Amber"". Other highlights include the psychotramatic lullaby of ""The Talk of Creatures"", the literally glass-shattering gutbucket blues of ""The Coming of the Crow"", and the Martian Beatles doo-wop of ""The Simple Song"". The rest of Commercial recycles the formula of demented, calliope-style melodies on whiny synthesizers and vocal histrionics that would've intoxicated Harry Smith had The Residents blew jugs and plucked banjos in northern Louisiana in 1952. To avoid indigestion, do not eat the whole thing.","San Francisco cult-icons The Residents supposedly attempt to mimic the song structure of commercial jingles in this reissue of their 1980 classic.

Boards' take on electronic music is so eminent and frequently imitated that it's become almost a sub-genre in itself. Their seal of approval is a valuable currency, and their scintillating ambience is a clear influence on Bibio's music. So is the fractured mien of esoteric electronic acts like Aphex Twin and Autechre, who Bibio discovered while studying music at the University of London. Of these three influences, Autechre is the most cold and sterile; Boards the most emotive, although in this sort of music, emotion generally manifests as a tension between human desire and artificial systems-- the raw stuff of feeling abstracted and viewed through a microscope. It seems to say: this is what it would feel like to feel, were genuine emotion possible in an age of ramifying obsolescence. To that end, Bibio inflates his music with more verdure and humanity than any of the aforementioned acts, as a large part of his style involves yoking heavily processed electronics to pastoral guitar lines and natural found sound, liked a glitched-out Windsor for the Derby. ""Bibio"", apparently, is the name of a fishing lure Wilkinson's father used on trips to Wales where a young Stephen developed his love of natural sounds. Surprisingly, his naturalist aesthetic rubs placidly against the ambient disarray of his debut, fi, a shoegazing drone that pays homage to the natural world simply by documenting it-- by listening, a simple thing that many of us often forget to do. Bibio sometimes veers toward the vanishing minimalism of Keith Fullerton Whitman, as on opening track ""Cherry Blossom Road"", where a quiet, beatific synth tone wraps around itself again and again. But just as often, he indulges a sort of breathy melodicism, as on the gleaming arpeggios of ""Bewley in White"" and ""Looking Through the Facets of a Plastic Jewel"". The album is not abrasive; in fact, it's soothing, but it is also saturated with distortion and synthetic effects that seem to represent technology's degradation of the equilibrium of ecological cycles. Or perhaps the modulating crackle winding through the idyllic guitar lines, birdsongs, and ambient wind effects represents nothing less than the human virus that creates the technology, which will eventually annihilate those tenuous, fragile sounds-- a paranoid but viable vision with which Boards of Canada, too, seem familiar. But Bibio forgoes Boards' precise rhythmic thrust in favor of more meandering, ramshackle compositions that paint ephemeral imagery in broad strokes of primary colors, wafting through your peripheral vision. His analog bent and penchant for lo-fi, malfunctioning equipment bestow upon fi an aura of intimacy and transparency, where each sound that comprises the spacious armatures is discernible. It's a familiar formula-- begin in serenity, introduce conflict, watch the theoretical dimensions unfurl-- which Bibio, with his naturalist's disposition, eases through with a delicate and appreciative eye. One imagines strolling through a dewy glade and finding HTML tags, instead of lovers' initials, carved into the trees.","Arriving at Mush via the recommendation of Boards of Canada's Marcus Eoin, Bibio manifests emotion as a tension between human desire and artificial systems.

But Wainwright's inspiration has never quite matched his devotion to the project, and this baroque setting is not entirely suitable for his considerable talents. He has a distinctive voice that imbued his first two albums with an instantly recognizable personality; yet, although he seems suited to show tunes and post-SoCal pop, his voice is lost among the flourishes of harp and harpsichord in the Want series. Even Wainwright's songwriting seems to suffer: his usually sparkling wit seems deadened by the weight of the music; his melodies lag, burdened by the profundity of their mission. The songs on last year's Want One sounded leaden under their overlush arrangements, and Want Two doesn't improve on that formula. If anything, it is a darker, more meditative sequel, less lively but more fragile and sensitive to the cruelties of a vicious world-- tragedy to its precursor's comedy. The album opens unpromisingly-- almost hostilely-- with the nearly six-minute ""Agnus Dei"", an overture full of gently pulsating strings and Latin lyrics. The song isn't just singularly dull, but it reveals the weaknesses of these sessions. Wainwright's gauzy vocals aren't particularly suited for this style of melodramatic music and often come across as disaffected or, worse, disengaged. Furthermore, the obsessiveness of his artistic vision often threatens to alienate his listeners through overlong songs and esoteric production. Fortunately, ""The One You Love"" quickly corrects the album's course, harking back to Wainwright's first two albums. It blends gently swaying pop with an angelic choir and the dulcimer-like guitar on the chorus, and shows off his gifts for introspective lyrics full of biting wit and for arrangements that are all the more dramatic for being understated. Songs like ""This Love Affair"", ""Gay Messiah"", and ""Crumb by Crumb""-- which could have come from either of his previous albums-- only reinforce this impression. However, the Want sensibility-- music as theatrical stage setting-- resurfaces throughout the album: in the recorder melody on ""Hometown Waltz"", in the chamber strings on ""Little Sister"", in the eddying instrumentation of the Jeff Buckley eulogy ""Memphis Skyline"". These songs seem uniformly static. Only the live recording of ""The Art Teacher"" manages to break form: Over a Philip Glass prism of piano chords, a plaintive horn, and a slightly sped-up tempo, Wainwright tells of a woman remembering her first love, the instructor of the title who turned her on to Romantic painter J.M.W. Turner. In a sense, the Want project sounds perfectly suited to Wainwright's ability to confront his problems through lyrical witticisms and to intensify all emotions-- especially romantic longings-- to an operatic level. But His tragedies remain exclusively personal; they rarely, if ever, extend to any community, gay or otherwise, and the songs derive some power from their insistently individual scope. On ""Waiting for a Dream"", Wainwright sings in the first verse: ""You are not my lover, and you never will be/ Cause you've never done anything to hurt me."" The ""Gay Messiah"" mixes gay and Christian iconography, but the Savior-- who is ""reborn from 1970s porn""-- is Wainwright's own personal Jesus; he even proclaims himself ""Rufus the Baptist"" and turns the refrain ""The gay messiah is coming"" into frank wordplay. Wainwright's obsession and self-destructive tendencies extend to his music as well, sabotaging the Want project but making both albums fascinating, even moving, in a peculiar way. Watching such an undeniably talented artist blindly follow such an errant muse can be endlessly compelling, and the failure of these two albums to capture his visions and ambitions with any adequacy possesses the pull of true tragedy. This doesn't necessarily elevate the music, but it does present Wainwright as both the fated tragic hero and the sexually ambiguous victim of the two album covers and it does recast the project as a small triumph within an extended train wreck.","This is the second entry in Rufus Wainwright's Want series, which pairs his dreamy voice and droll lyrics to audaciously over-the-top orchestration.

Mm..Food?,MF DOOM,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44fc0084474cd0c3670/1:1/w_160/4446b004.jpg,2004-11-15 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5255-mmfood/,Rhymesayers,"Rap loves food. Skeptics: name another genre that has its own brand of potato chips, or counts as heroes men named Notorious B.I.G. and Big Pun and Puffy and Fat Joe and Raekwon the Chef, or singlehandedly stabilized a dying French wine town with an MTV spot and a few choice Diddies. Foodtalk is facile shorthand, and after 15 years in the game, MF Doom has had his share of Warren G Cheezie Nachos and Master P Platinum BBQ Rap Snacks. But when hip-hop got fat and gangsta and lucrative-- as well as massively important, culturally influential, and-- Doom kept low, disgruntled by what he saw as big-money rap's new self-importance. ""Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck/ And still keep your attitude on self-destruct,"" Doom would say later in ""Rhymes Like Dimes"". By 1993, rap had toasted to The Chronic, Illmatic, and 36 Chambers; had it been released then, KMD's pointed and confrontational Black Bastards would have sounded but a wolf cry while the rest of hip-hop was taking its first sips of gin and juice. ""There are different topics besides murdering everybody. That seems to be the in thing-- how many people you can murder on a record. So I'm bringing it back to the old, bragging about how nice you are with the words."" Doom said this on NPR in 2003, but the sentiment holds true for his 1999 comeback solo full-length Operation: Doomsday. Like other rap heavyweights at the time, Doom promised world domination, but with tongue firmly in cheek, making tall boasts only to undermine them with nerdy self-deprecation and high-falutant science-fiction soap-ops. Doom ""came to destroy rap"" because rap had betrayed itself: Operation: Doomsday was the story of-- and vehicle for-- his return-to-roots revenge. ""Operation Doomsday complete,"" we're told in the opening sound collage of Mm..Food?. As an official follow-up to Operation: Doomsday, Mm..Food? is an attempt to make good on Doom's almost fascist conceit to restore rap's golden age despite its loss of innocence. While Doom doesn't drop strictly food-related rhymes, the album's subject matter is always commonplace: friends, sucka MCs, girls, weed, and hip-hop. Post Doomsday, MF Doom as MF Doom has no interest in the space-laser rapocalypse of King Geedorah's Take Me To Your Leader or the dysfunctional gangster whim of Madvillain's Madvillainy. Here Doom wants nothing more than to score some Clever Points with quirky one-liners over tight beats. ""On his own throne, the boss like King Koopa"", Doom spits silver dollars like a subway-card dispenser, but he also loosens his mask a bit for a few tender bleats: ""Look like a black wookie when he keeps his hair low,"" he confesses on ""Beef Rapp"". There aren't as many belly laughs on Mm..Food? as there were on VV1 or Madvillainy, but Doom does manage this spam-mail slam on ""Kookies"": ""Supposed to be checkin e-mails/ All I got is messages from ass naked females [cookies]/ I don't know no Jenny, she said it's free/ And I won't owe her a penny, and that's the last time I saw her/ But thousands of more horrors are on line (Gomorrah...)"". Unlike Doomsday, guest spots are smartly kept to a minimum, though in fairness, ""Rapp Snitch Knishes"" co-emcee Mr. Fantastik hardly embarrasses himself: ""True to the ski mask New York's my origin/ Play a fake gangsta like a old accordian."" Most of Doom's raps on Mm..Food? sacrifice cohesion for maximum punch. When Doom does muster some self-restraint, he comes off triply brilliant. From the beginning, the Count Bass-D production ""Potholderz"" darts back and forth across the metaphor until we simply can't tell whether Doom's talking about gloves or roach clips: ""What-- these old things?/ About to throw them away with the gold rings that make them don't fit like OJ"". The Whodini sample on ""Deep Fried Frenz"" is awful in that purposeful maybe-Eminem sort of way. Here Doom turns a feel-good song into a mess of betrayal, bitterness, and matter-of-fact credos: ""You could either ignore this advice, or take it from me/ Be too nice and people take you for a dummy."" With the exception of the album's two older tracks-- the Madlib-produced, Madvillainy leftover ""One Beer"" and the PNS-produced ""Yee Haw"", here re-recorded as ""Kon Queso""-- and ""Potholderz"", Doom controls all the production on Mm..Food?. A lot of these beats are old no-frills Special Herbs loops, most lacking the marks of Doom's science-fiction fetish. Of the newer beats, the 70s Blue Note funk on ""Vomitspit"" is up there with Doom's best production work, and the stuttery ""Potholderz"" has the best bassline on any hip-hop album this year. Doom is also one of the few producers who should be allowed to do sound collage skits: ""Poo-Putt Platter"" has sample sequences that at one point reads, ""'You risked your life for us.' 'Thanks.' 'I've lost an arm.' 'Good.' 'Stop it father!'"" One skit would have been plenty though; instead, Doom dumps four of these right in the middle of the album, a nasty rut that makes Mm..Food? pretty much unplayable front-to-back after the first few spins, especially since the tracks that follow these skits-- the elevator-rap ""Kon Karne"" and the maudlin ""Guinnesses""-- are among Doom's worst. If Mm..Food? feels merely good or somewhat inconsequential, it's because it is that way by design. Doom has no pretense here-- he's an equally great rapper and producer, and he wants people to respect him for his skills alone: ""It's about the beats/ Not about the streets and who food he about to eat"". On one hand we can admire his intentions; on the other we can criticize his pigheadedness. Hip-hop can be consequential and important when it wants to be, and perhaps the capable Doom is keeping his aspirations too far in check. The truth is that Doom could go on making five or six Mm..Food?'s each year for the rest of his career-- but when will ""merely good"" not be good enough?","After creating 137 records under 135 monikers-- including Viktor Vaughn, King Geedorah, and Metal Fingers-- this ex-KMD and current Madvillain star finally releases his second album under his Christian name, MF Doom.

Aghast Agape,Prosaics,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18513d197565213865f/1:1/w_160/16ba269b.jpg,2004-11-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6556-aghast-agape/,MatadorDim Mak,"By now, many of you may well be dubious of yet another band intent on firebombing music publications with a barrage of unavoidable stock post-punk reference points. To those whose eyes are still bleary from the sting of countless hasty Joy Division allusions in the past few years, I offer a simple caveat: For all intents and purposes, Prosaics are being billed as the next Interpol. Whether or not the comparison is valid is debatable, but Matador's press unit hasn't exactly underplayed the connection: ""It's rare that we find someone who captures our imaginations the same way our established faves have. Well, not without wanting millions of dollars."" Playful tone aside, the underlying motivations here are clear. The real problem with Aghast Agape, Prosaics' debut EP (originally released stateside by Dim Mak), is that the band doesn't offer any material that might diffuse accusations of straightforward stylistic photocopying. Their ethereal, angular post-punk replication is competent but anonymous, and their lyrics are epigrammatic bordering on cryptic, serving as ideal, nondescript verbal placeholders. Even their back story is pretty tepid: Two guys hang out in a NYC apt., jam a bit, hire drummer. The ""Behind the Music"" nadir of this scenario involves the mishandling of a Carl Thompson bass at the hands of a prospective band member. Compelling mythology it isn't, but appropriate for the album's relative lack of originality. Opener ""Teeth"" begins with a noisy guitar attack false start before smoothly transitioning into more pristine, driving minor key pop. The track is steeped in reverb-heavy production distantly reminiscent of early Echo and the Bunnymen, punctuated with jangling guitar lines and grounded by soaring vocal melodies by singer/guitarist Andy Comer, who wallows in affected Anglophiliac misery. The song's emotive, cryptic hook (""We preach wine/ And drink water"") establishes a pattern of passionately belted oblique phrases used for choruses on nearly every track. Other tracks reveal more contemporary influences. ""Failure"" utilizes upbeat Franz Ferdinand-style pop for its verses, layering on wailing backing vocals for another impenetrable couplet/chorus (""Acquaintances/ Aghast agape""). ""Now the Shadow of the Column"" resembles Interpol gone power-pop, with a gritty guitar pattern overlaying a pulsating bassline until the decked-out, synth choir-spiked chorus. ""Tenants"" is a brief but redeeming conclusion. The band focuses their energy into tighter production and stronger melodic hooks-- including their best chorus-- grounded by William Kuehn's dynamic, machine-gunned drumming. The album isn't without its moments, but nothing about Aghast Agape distinguishes Prosaics from the growing mass of post-punk revivalists cluttering the indie landscape. The band misses the core appeal of much of the music that inspires the album: Comer has studied Ian Curtis' despondency, but sacrifices his urgency and directness for clumsy stabs at abstruse poetry; he evokes Morrissey's deprecating anguish without the counterbalancing wit. The music is pleasant but fleeting, trapped between loving homage and faceless emulation. Aghast Agape establishes a stifling formula, making the band's name a bit too ironic for comfort.","By now, many of you may well be dubious of yet another band intent on firebombing music publications with a ...

Creative Playthings,Electric Company,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3413d197565213b27a/1:1/w_160/9a6eea33.gif,2004-11-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2731-creative-playthings/,Tigerbeat6,"What can be said of day-care center techno? For all of their high-minded explorations of the man-machine principle, Kraftwerk could still entertain any tyke. Hell, the Moog synthesizer itself has an inherent charm for ages 4-7, given its sound that seems edible. And then there's Mouse on Mars-- translating dense poststructuralist theories about rhizomes and ""bodies without organs"" into what often sounds like Saturday morning cartoon music, circa 2098. LA-based, post-techno wascal Brad Laner (Electric Company) exploits that essence on Creative Playthings. Laner's 10th album is too antsy to keep any conversation-- it's bound to knock into people with abrupt dissonance but leave furrowed brows and baffled smiles in its wake. Its fructose-poisoned jaunt ""A Rainbow of Traction"" rudely embodies that element with its panicking music box melodies, feminine ""ba-ba-ba-baa"" choirs, and a wicked, faux-snake charmer flute that cuts in midway. Such Fisher-Price psychedelia is a point that Laner has long progressed toward, this time mellowing out the glitches and lopsided song structures to concentrate more on rhythm and melody. His palette: old-school Nintendo Gameboy melodies, acoustic guitars that arise and get decapitated like dandelions in sidewalk cracks, dribbling digital-dub beats, and his own vocoderized android whispers that recall Kraftwerk's most ""human"" moments. Tackiness pervades, but it's forgivable. Opener, ""Stand Close, Don't Flatter Yourself"", sets the template with its seasick dub rhythms and a sudden blast of over-processed guitar as if scoring a melodramatic ""game over"" screen in a video game. Laner's data-crunched guitar freakouts also liven up the otherwise faceless blip-hop of ""Is There Another Door to Door?"", the Hendrixian solo on ""Crates of Dead Orange Markers"", and the Russian-style new wave polka of ""Recalcitrant"". The aquatic drone duet between guitar and synth in ""Jarhead"" simply hypnotizes. Creative's melodrama can be laughably bad at times. ""Theme from the Mushroom Shaped Tongue"" slaps together a preset-synth orchestra that soundtracks a direct-to-video, late-80s comedy during the scene where the hero is feeln' blue and looking for The Way, namely, ""Some crazy idea that just might work!"" ""Blue's Clues"" sappiness wrecks the whiny, ""Peter and the Wolf""-style melodies of ""She'll Be in Foal Again"". Oddly enough, the best of Creative are a handful of MP3s hidden on the CD. These tracks, (all titled by Laner holding down a key like ""aaaaaaa"" and ""ccccccccc""), have little to do with the album. They instead take on rather mature experiments with chalky guitar noise, glitch-hop and a loop of a woman whispering behind one's back. There is also a 19-minute concert tape from 1998 that sounds like Laner kicking and smacking an acid-fried engine to start. Makes sense.","Former Medicine and Amnesia frontman Brad Laner offers the latest release from his electronic project-- techno for the day-care centers of the future.

Disciples of the 36 Chambers: Chapter 1,Wu-Tang Clan,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa795e6ef959693215bb/1:1/w_160/49a399cd.jpg,2004-11-14 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8747-disciples-of-the-36-chambers-chapter-1/,Sanctuary,"Wu-Tang Clan's iconic ""W"" emblem is indelibly seared on New York hip-hop. RZA's off-kilter, refracted beats-- his chilly minor-key strings, bombastic horns, and sampled film dialogue-- have become the template for NYC beatmakers, and countless Gotham MCs, if not shamelessly jacking Raekwon's ghetto Mafioso lexicon and hard-bitten cadences, have a least a couple Wuisms tucked away in their repertoire. Wu-Tang were among the first emcees to capitalize on New York's mythological qualities, inflating mundane street narratives to epic bildungsromans by couching them in the tropes of their beloved Kung Fu movies and Kurosawa's Wuxia interpretations. By reincarnating the philosophical allegories of ancient Asian drama in 20th century Staten Island (a.k.a. Shaolin), they created a rare music that could touch both thugs and suburban fantasy buffs, each on their own terms. It's been a while since we've received a unified statement from Shaolin, so a quick roll call's in order. The RZA, a.k.a. Bobby Digital: shogun and CEO, the bipolar spitter of metaphysical knowledge and shit-talking battle raps. Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa: the steely growlers ballasting the more flamboyant personalities like sandbags. Method Man: the larger-than-life MCaricature with a bottomless bag of catchphrases. Raekwon: arguably the inventor of organized crime rap, who was cutting and flipping rhymes like weight long before every street hustler began to imagine himself a mafia don. Ol' Dirty Bastard (RIP): a deranged parody of a soul singer, a profane, gaudy libido coming unglued. Ghostface Killah: a gifted storyteller weaving densely coded slang, crushed out heavenly in yellow Wallabies and Wu-Wear fleece. The GZA: a candid lyrical prodigy meting out devastatingly precise similes. And finally, U-God: the most esoteric member of the collective, sometimes a crowd-moving party rapper, other times a dextrous prose-spitter, spinning inscrutable word collages in a velvety baritone. Amid long-running rumors of a break-up, on July 17th, 2004, the dormant Wu reconvened at the Rock the Bells festival in San Bernadino, California, and committed to tape the 27 tracks that now constitute the career-spanning live retrospective Disciples of the 36 Chambers: Chapter 1. Live hip-hop albums are rare, perhaps rightfully so: Hip-hop relies so heavily upon careful production techniques that live performances can be like tabloid photos of a sex symbols caught unawares on a trip to the beach: no make-up, cellulite showing. And how many times have you gone to a rap show only to wait three hours for half the group to appear and watch them walk off 20 minutes later? Miraculously, all nine original members showed up (plus a few auxiliary men, including Cappadonna). Even the famously erratic ODB was present, and even seemingly lucid, remembering all his lines and delivering them with charisma and flair. Dirty's recent passing is especially sad because it seemed as if he was finally getting his life back on track after all the drugs, rehab, incarcerations, and high-profile public meltdowns. Considering the unusual amount of restraint he shows here, it's a small but pleasant consolation that his final mark upon the world was so pristine. Regardless, each member of the Clan fell effortlessly into his role, and instead of the anonymous collective shout that live posse cuts can often become, the Wu skillfully traded lines and allowed individual members to shine, only occasionally merging into a monolithic roar that, interestingly enough, makes for a strong counterpoint to the solo verses. Disciples of the 36 Chambers's first six tracks are a medley from Wu-Tang's classic debut, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Beginning with RZA inciting the crowd to chant the group's name, the sampled voice describing Shaolin shadow-boxing that opens ""Bring Da Ruckus"" elicits an audience howl that persists until the song morphs into early single ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"", then onward through ""Clan in Da Front"", ""C.R.E.A.M."" (the most famous and obvious of Wu-Tang's many embedded acronyms-- e.g., ever notice that the oft-repeated lines ""Positive energy activates constant elevation"" and ""Protons electrons always cause explosions"" spell ""P.E.A.C.E.""?), ""Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit"", and ""Shame on a Nigga"". Wu-Tang's early work was their most skeletal and grimy, brimming with crackling electricity and an intuitive call-and-response factor, and the medley gets the crowd so amped that they could have coasted for the rest of the set. Rather, the Wu stay on point throughout, working through classics from Wu-Tang Forever (""Re-United"", ""It's Yourz"", ""Triumph"", etc.) with unremitting energy, peppering those cuts with more obscure favorites from their numerous solo albums. Raekwon turns in a faithful reproduction of ""Incarcerated Scarfaces""; his partner Ghost shines on ""Criminology"", ""Ghost Deini"", and a reworked version of ""Run"" that follows Cappadonna's original version of the same song. The GZA concisely recreates the first verse of his classic ""Liquid Swords""; Meth struts over crowd-pleasers like ""Ice Cream"" and ""Method Man""; Dirty checks in with remarkable performances of ""Brooklyn Zoo"", ""Dog S**t"", and ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"". Wisely, the Clan only break the furious momentum of their set a couple times to address the crowd (usually to remind them that they're witnessing an historical moment of ""real hip-hop, in its purest form""), and only draw two of the best songs from their somewhat diluted later work, ""Y'all Been Warned"" and the fizzy bounce track ""Gravel Pit"". It's also inspiring to hear prolific rappers who are entering a relative middle age outshine their younger imitators. On Disciples of the 36 Chambers, the Clan sounds hungry as ever, vicious and confident, and nowhere near depleted. Is the Wu about to make a big comeback? The signs are there: In his closing statements, RZA asks the crowd if they'd like to hear another Wu-Tang group album, a prospect that seemed lost to solo projects, acting roles, and deodorant commercials. The inquiry is met with a roar of undiluted enthusiasm. It isn't clear how Ol' Dirty Bastard's passing will effect any potential reunion plans-- it could either scupper them entirely, or galvanize the Clan to greater heights, as sudden tragedies are sometimes wont to do. Either way, I know I'll sorely miss one of the most ostentatious and original personalities in hip-hop, and Pitchfork's heartfelt condolences are extended to his friends, family, and fellow Killa Bees. To borrow a Dirty quote, the performance documented here is ""as high as Wu-Tang gets"", and it's comforting to know that the Dirt Dog got a final chance to bask in the spotlight that was both his lifeblood and his adversary.","With the passing of Ol' Dirty Bastard, this live set-- recorded in California in July-- is now a document of the final collaboration between the nine original Killer Bees.

The Ultimate Collection,Michael Jackson,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a65e6ef9596932022d/1:1/w_160/c1b7fe2f.gif,2004-11-14 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4350-the-ultimate-collection/,Epic,"The last time Michael Jackson was arrested for child molestation, I was watching ""Access Hollywood"" or ""Entertainment Tonight"" or another one of those shows. Number Ones, Jackson's greatest hits collection, was due to drop the following week, and Jackson was making noises about how the arrest was all part of an attempt to sabotage his album sales. The district attorney or sheriff or whoever was on TV at some press conference; he mentioned Jackson's accusations and said, ""Like I would actually listen to that kind of music."" What kind of music was this guy talking about? The kind that's sold nearly 150 million records worldwide? The kind that still packs floors at weddings, clubs, and parties? Jackson might be a walking punchline these days, but he's also the most successful solo artist of all time, someone who's written and recorded a career's worth of unspeakably great songs. It's not like the guy had just arrested G.G. Allin or something. But then, Jackson has been less a pop star than a freaky curiosity for more than a decade. His 2001 album Invincible bricked, as did Number Ones, and it's hard to imagine The Ultimate Collection-- his new hits-and-rarities box set-- will fare much better in the current hostile climate. Jackson, of course, may be desperate for any sort of positive attention, any way to reclaim his legacy and remind the public that he reached a level of stratospheric fame on the strength of his music. And a lot of the music on The Ultimate Collection is pretty much perfect. The set starts on a ridiculously high note with The Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back"", an unbelievably giddy blast of infectious joy. We don't get a whole lot of other early Jackson 5 material (no ""The Love You Save"" or ""Going Back to Indiana""), but what we do get is spectacular. Interestingly, the set leans heavily on lesser known, later-period Jackson 5 tracks like ""Enjoy Yourself"" and ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"", which are similarly revelatory and impeccably produced elegant disco-soul pieces. It's fun to hear Jackson's voice progress from the joyous, energetic whoops of his early singles to the taut, clipped, more rhythmic style of his first collaborations with producer Quincy Jones, on a pair of surprisingly solid gospel-Broadway-funk tracks from the soundtrack to The Wiz. This partnership would lead to Off the Wall, for which Jones piled layer upon layer of glistening disco strings, itchy percolating guitars, twinkling synths, blasting horns, nasty funk bass, and sophisticated, intricate rhythms behind Jackson's fragile, chiffon voice, resulting in the single best pop album of the disco era. Four tracks from Off the Wall are included here, and all of them are breathtaking, particularly the swooping, ecstatic ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"". Jackson's next collaboration with Jones was, of course, Thriller, still among the best-selling albums of all time. The set's second disc is devoted to tracks from the Thriller era, including five songs from the album itself, as well as a shitty lite-funk demo version of ""P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)"". Thriller might be overly familiar, but most of its songs still hold up surprisingly well. ""The Girl Is Mine"", a duet with Paul McCartney, is straight-up M.O.R. vanilla bullshit (on which Jackson effortlessly outsings McCartney), but other songs remain great: the limber dance-funk of ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"", the glossy plastic bubblegum-metal of ""Beat It"", and especially the chilly, paranoid masterpiece ""Billie Jean"". Even more than Jackson's other Quincy Jones collaborations, ""Billie Jean"" sounds incredible on headphones. The pulsing, insistent bass, the spacey synth chimes, and the shivery descending strings perfectly support the adult Jackson's definitive vocal performance, a percussive pileup of freaked-out tics, yelps, moans, and hiccups. The second disc also includes a whole lot of utterly godawful rarities. ""Someone in the Dark"" is a maudlin faux-Broadway ballad from the E.T. soundtrack that includes a bewilderingly bizarre vocal cameo from the alien himself. It seems to be the exact moment that Jackson began to make the transition from exciting young pop star to neutered humanoid elf. We also get a solo demo version of ""We Are the World"" and ""We Are Here to Change the World""-- the theme from Jackson's incomprehensible 3-D Disney World sci-fi opus Captain EO. It's difficult to believe that someone thought these tracks were more worthy of inclusion than ""The Love You Save"". The set picks back up again on the third disc with six tracks from Bad, Jackson's final collaboration with Jones. Most of these tracks still sound great, especially the feverish, insistent ""Smooth Criminal"". By this point, his vocal style was pretty much dominated by tourettic tics, and this new approach meshes with Jones' more rhythmic synth-funk. Jackson's later collaborations never approached the chemistry of Jones and Jackson. On 1991's Dangerous, he worked with the then-cutting edge new jack swing producer Teddy Riley, who had produced major singles for smoother, cleaner singers like Bobby Brown and Guy's Aaron Hall. But Jackson sounds lost over the hard-edged breakbeats of ""Jam"" and the staccato keyboards of ""Remember the Time"", even though the two do find the right note on ""Who Is It (HIS Mix)"", a shivery, low-key dance track. Meanwhile, ""Black or White""-- never Jackson's finest moment, but Dangerous' biggest hit nonetheless-- inexplicably includes the Macaulay Culkin/George Wendt skit from the video. Nearly everything Jackson has done since is just terrible, making the fourth disc an unbearable slog. Oddly, the set excludes ""Scream"", Jackson's biggest hit of the past 10 years, leaning instead on the ballads from 1996's HIStory-- ""You Are Not Alone"" and ""Childhood (Theme from Free Willy 2)"". In comparison, the material from Invincible almost sounds good, with the album's title track riding a hard Rodney Jerkins beat, and a posthumous Biggie verse ProTooled in. Still, nothing from this era comes within a mile of touching Jackson's best material, and all of the previously unreleased material on the disc (about half the CD), is boring to the point of being unlistenable. The set also includes a DVD of a Dangerous-era concert in Bucharest, which is pretty funny. It's a dazzlingly elaborate Disney-style greatest hits revue, more memorable for the puppet skeletons that come out during ""Thriller"" or the angel that flies over the stage for ""Will You Be There"" than for the actual music. Jackson's dancing is still amazing, and the enormous, rapturous crowd is fun to watch, but it's hard to get around the weird gold codpiece thing Jackson wears for the first half of the show or the ridiculous homoerotic Teutonic dancers. If Jackson was hoping to call attention back to his music, and away from his inexplicable eccentricities, it's hard to believe he'd want to include this show. In fact, the whole set is pretty strange. The Ultimate Collection doesn't make a great career overview; there's just too much extraneous crap. It would have made a lot more sense to simply box up Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad in their entireties (it's not like these albums were bloated with filler) along with a disc of Jackson 5 and early solo material and maybe a DVD of videos and early TV appearances. The rarities and recent material drag the box down enormously, but it still does what might be its primary job: to remind us that Michael Jackson is one of the greatest pop stars of all time.","Are you ready for the holiday release schedule? We are! This week and next will mark some of the music world's craziest Christmas-friendly releases. And Michael Jackson's first career-spanning box set kicks off the festivities.

Songs About the Ocean / .010,High Water MarksUlysses,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e05e6ef95969320064/1:1/w_160/7baea2dc.jpg,2004-11-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11641-songs-about-the-ocean-010/,Eenie Meenie,"When the only cable channel that will place your video in heavy rotation is The Cartoon Network, what does that say about your band? Far from being merely associated with cartoons, The Apples in Stereo spent the beginning of the decade on the verge of actually becoming a cartoon, for all intents and purposes. They had always been a sort of caffeinated children's band for adults, content to sing about glowworms and UFOs in their signature lo-tech hi-fi sonic environment while frontman Robert Schneider enjoyed his kingpin status in the Elephant 6 collective. Regardless of the Apples' schedule, Schneider has never wanted for work, producing more albums than you can count and picking up whatever instrument or potentially musical object happened to be lying around and going to tape with it for some friend's band. When your friends are guys like Jeff Magnum, Bill Doss, and Will Cullen Hart, you wind up on a few classic albums, and Schneider's career looks mighty enviable to this point. But regardless, there comes a point where you look around and you're in your thirties, risking falling into some sort of indie Raffi pigeonhole. Schneider's primary accomplice, drummer Hilary Sidney, looked around and saw it too, and The Apples went to recess a couple of years ago as each of them focused on other creative endeavors. Schneider naturally kept busy with all manner of recording work and even kept up a musical correspondence with Andy Partridge that came to no fruition, and ultimately put together Ulysses for a quick run through some new material that became .010. Sidney, meanwhile, sent tapes back and forth in the mail to Norwegian singer Per Ole Bratset (Palermo) and the two wound up with the tracks that became The High Water Marks' debut, Songs About the Ocean. Listening to the two albums together, it's clear that The Apples needed a break, and both records have a lo-fi spontaneity that the flagship band hasn't been able to muster in ages. Schneider and Ulysses went as stripped-down as possible, recording live into a single microphone in the garage of Pet Sounds Studios, tossing a couple of vocal and synth overdubs over the top and calling it done. It's a high-risk, high-return method that trims virtually all prospective fat off of Schneider's workmanlike compositions, forcing the simple arrangements to work solely for the song at hand. Sure, the recording muddies up any time he hits his distortion pedal, there's no nuance in the drums at all, and the tapes become ridiculously saturated when the band breaks loose, but it really doesn't matter much-- Schneider's final mix presents the songs in gloriously direct mono and they're simple and catchy enough to hold up. The Sidney/Bratset tape correspondence has a similar effect, but the relaxed time frame is reflected in its more complex and considered arrangements. With two principle vocalists trading off, there's a certain natural variety to the material. The duo have sugar-coated melodies to spare, but the songs are a little compromised over the course of a whole album simply by the fact that those melodies can slip under the surface of the recording from time to time. The fidelity also varies a lot from song to song: ""Suicide"" lumbers along under too much hiss (and Sidney struggles to be heard), but ""Sixth of July"" immediately follows with a punchy, up-front melody and some strong, bright lead guitar work from Bratset (he has a penchant for noisy, Ira Kaplan-esque soloing that, oddly enough, fits fairly well). Ultimately, both albums are somewhat torn affairs-- their relatively spontaneous creation and pointed lack of calculation are part of the charm, but you get the idea that each record could be made great simply by revisiting the material with sharper sound and greater attention to detail. For fans of The Apples In Stereo, these records are nonetheless a no-brainer, as the songs themselves are easily up to that band's standards. Schneider in particular seems to be keen on expanding his lyrical reach here-- the lines ""Inside a pissed off prostitute/ I try to take my mind off you,"" from ""Push You Away"", just wouldn't have worked on an Apples record. If nothing else, it's good to hear him and Sidney growing up a bit, even if they had to do it apart from each other.",,6.8,
Retrospective,Smith & Mighty,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68bb1335d7bf1698e57/1:1/w_160/3b6d3900.jpg,2004-11-11 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7786-retrospective/,!K7,"Whither trip-hop? What happened to Bristol's most famous cultural export, a sound that teased listeners with impressions of Major-era urban Britain as a Blade Runner fantasy? In the days when Tricky, Massive Attack, and Portishead were heralded as the town's mavericks, the music seemed to be a fine cosmopolitan blues for the early 90s recession. Hip-hop beats that wander the streets every night to find God, basslines that hiss from soundsystems bloodied from a decade of tear, and Hollywood's spectacle of ""noir""-- all mourned utopian visions discarded by pragmatism and fashion sense. Cynics framed the genre's death certificate, dated September 29, 1998 when UNKLE's Psyence Friction was released to tin ears and demoralized souls. But in an age when hip-hop productions can sound dry-cleaned, some elements of trip-hop are still missed. Retrospective, a greatest-hits, b-sides, and rarities collection from Smith & Mighty, could further mystify the genre. Producers Rob Smith and Ray Mighty helped import hip-hop into the city during the early 80s with their Three Stripes Sound System, which mixed soul, dub, and funk that helped catalyze the ""Bristol Sound."" Later that decade, they won a cult hit by giving that treatment to Burt Bacharach's ""Walk On By"" and Massive Attack's first single, ""Any Love"" (1988). S&M; didn't release their own album until 1995's Bass Is Maternal, and later garnered sleeper success on !K7's DJ Kicks series. So what do Smith & Mighty's Retrospective tracks now mean to you and your family? Well it depends on how you adjust your stereo. If the volume is muffled to dentist office-level and the bass is removed, then you'll get some snazzy'n'chic beats and diva operas for your next visit to JCPenney's. But if your subwoofers are cranked loud enough to strike a dozen neighborhood watch alerts, then Smith & Mighty uncannily translate British R&B; and soul to the cardboard-matted dancefloor. For instance, the opener, ""Come On Back""-- sung by feted chanteuse Carlton-- could either be a dub-lite AOR tune or a bass-bruised, Trenchtown soliloquy. The dependence on drum machines and synths unfortunately date and trap most of the music in the late 80s. The highlights inculde the S&M-produced; 1989 UK hit by Funk 4, ""Wishing On a Star"", with its sample of James Brown's timeless ""Funky Drummer"". Other high points include the dub-jungle space out, ""Move You Run (Blue & Red Mix)"", and dancehall toaster Niji's boasting of his speakerbox to a drum'n'bass strut in ""B Line Fine Blow"". But nothing on Retrospective is as radical or abstract enough as albums by fellow Bristolians like, say, Massive Attack's Blue Lines or Portishead's Dummy. The mysteries are absent-- it's up to historians and nostalgists to create new ones.","Bristol stand up!

Love Suffers Long,Smoke and Smoke,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68cea9e61561daa53bf/1:1/w_160/fef95cb2.jpg,2004-11-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7787-love-suffers-long/,Frenchkiss,"This is the most salient thing I can tell you about Smoke and Smoke: They don't give a fuck. They really don't. Over the tumbling drums and righteously acidic riffing of ""Into the Smoke and Smoke"", Spencer Moody reminds us, ""You're gravely mistaken if you think for a second that Smoke and Smoke give a fuck-fuck-fuck"". Even when that's not being overtly rammed home, disdain and apathy incessantly seep out of the strident, repetitive chords and tar-stained screeds that sear across their debut album-- nine tracks wrapped up in only about twice that many minutes. Misanthropy's not just Smoke and Smoke's guiding principle-- it's their very medium; their hookless lo-fi brutality seems built from the stuff. Love Suffers Long is a sustained musical middle finger that, behind a stone-faced aspect, is chuckling ironically about the banality of the gesture and wondering who would be na\x95ve enough to think it mattered. With this kind of automatic cred, I guess you can get away with it. Follow the tendrils of smoke as they furl: Smoke and Smoke is comprised of Spencer Moody, Mike Kunka, and Dan Haugh. Kunka and Haugh played together in godheadSilo (Kunka was also in Enemymine), and Smoke and Smoke's musical style could be described as a much more streamlined version of those bands' grinding, repetitive proto-punk. It's perhaps a wounded version of it, which would be apt, considering that godheadSilo went kaput when Haugh injured the tendons in his left arm, and Dead Low Tide, the band Kunka played in with singer Spencer Moody (told you it was going to get twisted), fizzled when Kunka was sick for more than year with whooping cough (dude-- whooping cough? What's next, rickets?). Moody is best known as the singer for Murder City Devils, but here he gruffly rants more than sings, even less melodically than his MCD style. His repertoire of Fauvist koans, bad jokes, skewed aphorisms, and lyrical anticlimaxes evoke his pal and tourmate Tim Harrington, another fuming art-punk trapped in the body of a beard-folker. (Visually, Moody's a dead-ringer for Harrington-- beard, paunch, and all.) Within the echo chamber of stabbing guitars that is ""Strike Lightning Strike"", he offers: ""The forest was already on fire when the lightning struck,"" and on the chaotic, staccato throb of opening track ""How Did the Cook Get His Finger Stuck in the Dishwasher?"", Moody checks in with a winking groaner of a punch line: ""I don't know, but they both got fired."" The collision of Moody's snarled soliloquies with his bandmates' strangely inert, slogging foundations often evokes another professional cynic, Steve Albini, singing about ""real squirrels"" on 1,000 Hurts, particularly on absurdist dirges like ""Bathrobe Jacket"", with its curious refrain, ""Bathrobe jacket, ascot towel"". On ""Throw the Lever"", with its drunken wobble and seesawing melody, they come across like a no-wave Hold Steady. The tacit message seems to be that trying is for suckers, and caring about anything, passe. In one illuminating example, the band's online blog states: ""Our full-length, Love Suffers Long (I think that's what it's called), will be released this coming Tuesday."" It's not exactly a new pose for rock music, but worth mentioning for the fact that Smoke and Smoke have managed to boil furious indifference down to its most basic essence. The album's live-recording style only bolsters the effect: You don't feel as if the music really wants to be listened to, and at the end of each song, it's not hard to imagine that you've wandered into Smoke and Smoke's practice space and they've abruptly stopped playing to gaze at you with mild irritation, appalled by the incredible imposition.","Former Murder City Devil Spencer Moody says: ""If you don't give a damn, he don't give a fuck.""

Paradise Now,Hall of Fame,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c16aea9e61561daa7d93/1:1/w_160/ed28c615.jpg,2004-11-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3997-paradise-now/,Social Registry,"It's been four years since Brooklyn-based Hall of Fame released their mesmerizing self-titled third album (not to be confused with their self-titled 1996 debut), and during their absence the subterranean tides which govern enlightened tastes and imaginations obviously continued to ebb and flow. As fortune would have it, however, the psych-folk landscape that Hall of Fame helped germinate is now at full bloom; Paradise Now is one more prize to this year's already bountiful harvest. Though it's doubtful that music this communal and vaporous can have a true focal point, the trio's sound is generally organized around the talents of singer-instrumentalist Samara Lubelski, who formerly played violin with artsy Rodan spin-off The Sonora Pine. Lubelski also moonlights as an engineer at the renowned Rare Book Room recording studio (where she assisted on such Pitchfork-friendly albums as Ted Leo's Hearts of Oak and The Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat) and on Paradise Now it sounds as though Hall of Fame had ample studio time to fully marinate and slow-cook their songs to a smoke-ringed maturity. As with fellow Siltbreeze alumni Charalambides and Tower Recordings (whose seminal 2001 release Folk Scene also featured contributions from Lubelski), Hall of Fame use some of the traditional instruments and methods of folk-rock as a gateway to a monumental, highly personalized cosmic drift that swiftly eludes any earthbound categorization. Paradise Now is more song-oriented than the trio's previous work, and in places Lubelski's languorous vocals recall some of Georgia Hubley's most engaging lullabies with Yo La Tengo. But even at their most accessible, these songs possess such unstable molecular structures that every sound is permitted to gradually and elegantly dissipate into the ether in the same manner a campfire slowly consumes a handful of pine needles. Tracks like ""Endless Returns"" or ""Hall of Fire""-- with their gauzy guitar arpeggios and whispered, indistinct vocals-- may at first fool you into branding Paradise Now ""lo-fi"", but a couple of attentive listens should prove that passages initially mistaken for bottomless murk actually teem with carefully sculpted layers of light and movement. Thin shafts of violin and other plucked strings dodge and weave through the gentle, persistent hum of vintage amplifiers, while the percussion completely abandons forward propulsion and instead settles on slo-mo cymbal crashes and distant conversation. Even the placidly strummed acoustics of ""Arrow By Day"" eventually begin to disintegrate pixel-by-pixel, until the tune is carried off on the backs of dragonflies and replaced by the hazy ecstasy of ""My Sweet Miasma"" which sounds like The Jesus and Mary Chain on holiday in the Hundred Acre Wood. Throughout the album, Hall of Fame maintain such a uniform level of mood and texture that naysayers might think that the band has merely rewritten the same song 10 different times. But those who prefer to do their astral navigating uninterrupted by any superfluous intrusions from reality will surely consider Hall of Fame's consistency to be a virtue, and they could soon find immersion into the calming and restorative waters of Paradise Now to be their recreation of choice.","This Brooklyn-based band was psych-folk long before Pitchfork decided that sound was cool.

A Treasury,Nick Drake,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba11eb335119a49ec93f/1:1/w_160/5336b976.jpg,2004-11-11 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2446-a-treasury/,Island,"The co-option of tragedy is a sad and seemingly inevitable fixture of our society. It's usually the most visible public figures who succumb first-- to political pathos, to the scrounging hands of big business-- but even the tiniest calamities are fair game when there's a profit to be made. Few will argue that Nick Drake's inconspicuous career didn't deserve some special recognition after the folk singer's untimely death in 1974, and special recognition is what it got: first in 1986 with the odds-and-sods mix Time of No Reply and expressly introductory Heaven in a Wild Flower: An Exploration of Nick Drake, then again in 1994 with an unneeded (but not necessarily unwelcome) best-of collection, Way to Blue: An Introduction to Nick Drake. Ten years later, a third-wave of posthumous Drake paraphernalia has arrived: In June, Island Records issued Made to Love Magic, a piecemeal assemblage of unreleased material, and now the label brings us A Treasury, a revamped greatest hits compilation. Island is hoping recent high-profile discoveries of the man's music will move units the way his songcraft has long moved souls, but the whole act seems a bit redundant. Drake's albums not only stand up well enough alone to render all the honorary drivel moot, they're as tight and succinct as any compilation could hope to be. And with only three records to his credit, neophytes don't exactly face a long and spotty recorded history to sift through for the goods. But-- let's be real-- who didn't see this coming: the ceremonial unveiling of a lost tomb of heretofore unheard tracks, followed by a sorely unneeded mix of career highlights. The problem is that Drake's legacy is already well-worn ground. By this point, there are likely very few remaining newcomers who weren't already trounced by the deluges of 1986 and 1994 or wooed by the bard's Volkswagen spot. Of course, with an artist as fecund as Drake, the argument over which of his songs are ""definitive"" and warrant best-of inclusion is endless. No one is ever going to produce an introductory compilation as well-formed, as enigmatic, or as emotionally charged as any of Drake's studio efforts. Which is why A Treasury's failure is great, but understandable. Unlike most acts of exploitation, this one is reasonably benign. Nearly every song on A Treasury is a show-stopper, and the track selection is fine, spotlighting Drake's weighty insights and limning the various complexions of his character. After ""Introduction"", the album really gets going with ""Hazey Jane II"", which is perhaps Drake's most upbeat-sounding song, though it's actually a claustrophobic damning of city life. ""What will happen,"" Drake asks, over the baffling strain of gilt cool-jazz horns, ""when in the morning, when the world, it gets so crowded that you can't look out your window in the morning?"" The song is from Bryter Layter, Drake's second album, which coincided with the country lad's timorous arrival in London, and the buoyant orchestration is oddly foreboding of the subsequent rift between Drake, the city, and producer Joe Boyd. The poignancy of the opening track is only outshone by ""River Man"", perhaps the dearest 5/4 love ballad ever crafted and the song most directly responsible for critics' and biographers' eager use of the words ""sweeping"" and ""orchestral"" in describing Drake's sound. Like ""River Man"", ""Cello Song"" is lifted from Five Leaves Left, and slyly incorporates the baroque instrumentation that marked that album without squelching Drake's lissome guitar playing and his velvety hummed inflections. On ""Hazey Jane I"", Drake's relationship with the bevy of studio musicians who accompanied him on Bryter Layter hits its excessive apex, but once again Drake shines: Amid a Morricone-esque swirl of overwrought strings and booming, tympanic drumming, Drake delivers one of his most distinctive guitar parts, a wily, galloping line that evokes the American West better than, well, most American artists. But first-timers would be better off hearing these songs in the context of their respective albums, where-- in close proximation to music written in similar moods-- they take on a different and richer hue. Much is made of Drake's notorious depression, and rightly so. His emotional undulations certainly colored his work, and are keenly felt in songs like ""Way to Blue"" and ""Northern Sky"". But singer/songwriters-- few of whom offer any contest for Drake-- often make their living in the doldrums, and to conflate Drake's studiously honed skills with the putative inspiration of his personal struggles is melodramatic. The supernal emotion of Drake's songs is more a product of a fertile mind (Drake studied English at Fitzwilliams College in Cambridge) and a phenomenally inventive and versatile guitar style than a tortured soul. That said, Drake fandom is an emotional investment, and thus far more subjective than one's typical grazing interest in less magnetic, less substantive, less tragic artistic personalities. Nick Cave is great, but he's still alive and still churning out albums, reconfiguring his legacy with every new catalogue entry. Drake never had the opportunity to sully (or bolster) his quaint, near-perfect canon. Many would argue that's a good thing, but instead the job falls to anthology-mongering record labels, whose interest in preserving the artist's legacy is secondary. However huge and malfeasant the failings of this collection, the depth of persona and enormity of talent still shines through, and it's going to take a heck of a lot worse than this to undercut Drake's memory.","Despite only recording three studio albums in his lifetime, Nick Drake has had three rounds of career exhumation, the latest of which closes with A Treasury, a single-disc, best-of compilation.

Encore,Eminem,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc60c0084474cd0c2a97/1:1/w_160/5ba1f88b.jpg,2004-11-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2772-encore/,InterscopeShadyAftermath,"In 2000, Eminem was frequently vilified as a hatemonger, homophobe, and misogynist; in 2002, he was on the shortlist for Time magazine's ""Man of the Year."" America loves a tale of redemption almost as much as one of comeuppance, but at the start of the decade you'd have gotten pretty long odds on the media and cultural elite spinning the Marshall Mathers yarn as the former before the latter. And yet, somewhere between hugging Elton onstage at the Grammys and sending that guy in the Pistons jersey to pick up his Oscar, Em was feted by many of America's best-known cultural crits, columnist, and pundits: Frank Rich, Andrew Sarris, Maureen Dowd, Greil Marcus, Neal Gabler, and Paul Slansky (among others) either laid garlands at his feet or rhapsodized about the supposed transformation of the rapper/actor. The epistolary weepie ""Stan"" and the survivalist self-helpisms of ""Lose Yourself"" played a part in the slow mainstream media embrace of Eminem, but it's that ""slash"" that seemed to complete the embrace. For whatever reason, a film career can do that-- maybe it's the ability for a lengthy narrative to be more explicitly mutli-dimensional or maybe it's just lazy thinking and knee-jerk reactionary assumptions about pop, but you're now as likely to see Em torn down on Vibe than The New York Times Magazine. Well, Maureen, Andrew, and Greil, get ready to be excited; most of the rest of you-- the ones who've been held enthrall by Em's complex games of shifting his identity, challenging hypocrisy, baiting liberal guilt, and spitting deft rhymes with his labyrinthine flow-- prepare for disappointment: Encore is a fourth fascinating record from Eminem, but it's also easily his weakest and, in many ways, tamest album to date. Eminem's reaction to respectability seems to have been to move in two different directions: introspection and reconciliation on the one side, and bodily fluid-obsessed humor on the other. Tracks in which Em offers confessions, explanations, and apologies for previous comments and his participation in high-profile beefs share time here with belching, farting, vomiting, and urinating. He's also scrubbed his lyrics of homophobia (instead, the fascinating and eyebrow-raising homoeroticism hinted at on The Eminem Show-- and literally fleshed out in his music video cross-dressing-- colors a handful of his songs here) and, save a few blasts at Kim, any elements of misogyny. Therefore, if Encore is anything, it's a transitional record. After an image-confounding trio of pseudo self-titled records, the Eminem of Encore is wounded and weary; he's removing the layers of meta, still laughing and nodding but rarely winking, and not disappearing behind what The Village Voice's Frank Kogan once labeled Em's lyrical ""trapdoors and escape hatches."" Instead, the LP is the sound of a man who seems bored of re-branding and playing celebrity games, and often seems to be rapping only to entertain himself with little regard for any potential audience. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Despite the album's pronounced maturity/infantilism divide, it's a different dichotomy that characterizes the album's highlights: Here, Em is at his best when he's either more focused than even before or at his most scattered and playful. Unfortunately, most of the tracks that don't veer toward either extreme are plodding and unremarkable. Much of the first third of the record features Eminem unloading his emotional weight. Childhood tale ""Yellow Brick Road"" is the closest thing to biographical narrative he's ever done, and his remorseful explanation of the situation around which he, as a hurt kid, lashed out in a few racially-tinged rhymes at a black girl is not only compelling but effectively diffuses Source editor Benzino's long-running attack campaign on the rapper. It's also Em's best exploration of living his life in the rare space between America's too-wide racial divide. Fittingly, it leads into ""Like Toy Soldiers"", a public hand-wringing over the feuds that Em and 50 Cent have been drawn into, the consequences of these battles, and-- most importantly-- the toll they've taken, both physically and emotionally. The martial beat is a bit heavy-handed, but it's counterbalanced by the pleasantly surprising chorus' sample of Martika's ""Toy Soldiers"", perhaps a nod to either Kanye's helium-vocaled samples or the 00s trend toward trance-pop covers of 80s hits. Em also shines when he spins well off his axis, as he does on both the hilarious ""Rain Man"" and the R. Kelly/Triumph the Insult Comic Dog-baiting ""Ass Like That"", songs that both tell a lot of the same sort of celebrity- or redneck-oriented jokes as previous Em tracks, but have new punchlines and almost completely skip the need for structure. The songs sound more like mixtape or freestyle material than album tracks, and they're better off for it. Outside of those tracks and a few lively guest spots from the usual suspects (50 Cent, Nate, Dre, Obie-- hey, where's Proof?), things get sketchy. ""Mosh""-- sadly, not yet completely past its sell-by date-- seems more like a plodding dirge here among the spry string of tracks that surround it. ""Just Lose It"" is still most notable for dancing with paedo and homoerotic imagery: It's the one track here that seems as potentially multilayered as the best of The Marhsall Mathers LP, yet it's still more curio than anything else. On one of the two Kim tracks, Em confuses domestic violence with commitment, an awkward flirtation with the idea that you only hurt the ones you love. Elsewhere, with their relationship now more deteriorated than ever, poor Kim only rates a ""you make me puke"" where she once was murder ballad ""worthy."" Sonically, the record is more of the same: simple minor-chord piano lines, Dre's elastic funk, Em's clicky and too-often weak drums. A ""Crazy on You"" sample is wasted on a weak track (""Crazy in Love"") and the belching chorus of ""My 1st Single"" threatens to pulls the rug out from under an otherwise durable song. The advantage of Em going back to same musical well is that he's become so adept at riding these types of beats that his delivery and tangible personality are compelling almost no matter what the content of his rhymes; he even mixes things up with drastic shifts in cadence-- sometimes within the same track-- and occasional impersonations. In the promotional run-up to Encore's release, Eminem has been dressed in his courtroom best, suits and wire-rims-- again, great for the Manhattan media, but another MOR flag. At 30-plus, he's also worried about his legacy, trying to mobilize his version of a live-free-or-die army, and the record even drops very vague yet odd hints at retirement. Em has specifically said that the curtain isn't coming down, but the almost afterthought with which the record is framed (packaged and titled more like an addendum to The Eminem Show rather than a follow up with a two-year gap), its jaw-droppingly weak single, and the smoke-and-mirrors of coasting on talent and skill indicates that he either needs a breather or a new well of inspiration.","After more than five years spent battling media hypocrisy (and most of his family), hip-hop's most notorious white rapper returns with his first full-length since his well-received performance and Oscar-winning musical contribution to 8 Mile.

The Vladislav Delay comparisons are not far off: McIlwain is as competent a free-former as he is a slick beatmaker, and as Lusine (and earlier as Lusine icl and L'usine), he's produced legitimate specimens of everything from Warp-inspired ambient techno to proper microhouse to lush loop manipulations. Few electronic artists manage such variety with uniformly good results. And by carrying themes and textures across his otherwise disparate tracks and/or sequencing his albums so their tracks self-compound, Lusine has shown that he's capable of producing an engaging and eclectic full-length. He just, well, hasn't done it yet. Serial Hodgepodge is not perfect, but its ambition is admirable. As the name of the album implies, Lusine has an unabashedly short attention span here. Gorgeous processed vocals on ""Ask You"" (think Markus Popp's So project) open the album with chilly pessimism, a current which carries throughout the album's impeccable first third. Glassy synth and displaced melodies on ""Slur"" pick up where the Richard D. James Album left off, while the short but soaked drone ""Drip"" plays off a distant piano flutter we heard on Tim Hecker's Radio Amor. In each of these tracks Lusine is remarkably frugal-- he often forgoes percussion accents when they can be understood in the rhythm of his samples, sometimes even distracting us from the beat with perfectly concurrent melodies. ""The Stop"" benefits the most from his spare approach. It's Akufen-style cut-up house but without actual cut-ups, those same processed vocals quickly squeezing out the scraps of earlier melodies before the drum loop degenerates into syncopated figures and squelch. Lusine nails these first four tracks. The rest of Serial Hodgepodge is in permanent flux, however. The canned chill-out track ""Everything Under The Sun"" robs the album of nearly all its momentum. With warm wisps, bouncey-ball kicks, and enough pink noise to make for fine M-series microhouse, ""Figment"" comes close to restoring it, but Lusine curiously withholds the four-four downbeat, making for a suspenseful but ultimately excruciating listen. Ultimately, Serial Hodgepodge fails by the same token: Lusine has the talent to make good on his aspirations, but seems to refuse the extra effort that his sort of perfection demands.","Lusine-- sometimes wackily called ""the American Vladislav Delay""-- offers a mix of sounds that varies in both style and quality.

But even the most ardent fans usually forget that Doom started his career as a designer for Wizard trading cards, home of the middle school pastime Magic: The Gathering. The names of tracks from the 2004 compendium Special Herbs Vol. 3-8 were delivered as promo package to the Magic: Eleven Noon series. It is my privilege to recreate the play-by-play of a match from earlier this year in which Doom faced his card-slinging nemesis Cut Chemist in the Malibu Beatmakers Magic/Yu-Gi-Oh Throwdown. MAGES BEGIN: Currently, Doom and Chemist are tied at 16 life apiece. Doom taps four mana to enchant both his Vermillion Bandit and Ghost Prawn with the redolent Saffron. An audacious move. Saffron, the most expensive of all Greek spices, woos both Bandit and Prawn with sumptuous scratching and delicate wafting keys. The subtle vibes and upbeat tempo imbues both creatures with +1/+1 upgrade and a fistful of flavor. Chemist counters by dropping an extra Forest mana and introducing Seshiro the Annointed, a legendary 3/4 snake monk. Chemist has also released the feisty Zatar, queen of the Middle Eastern spices. Zatar's ghastly power lies in her mimicry, and she adopts the form of Patti LaBelle circa 1986 and smothers Ghost Prawn with her bosom. Prawn deceases. A single tear rolls from Doom's steel faceplate. Sensing that his ass is exposed, Doom reluctantly taps more Island mana to release both Brass Secretary and the Greasemonger. To add to their collective fury, Doom endows them with carcinogenic Monosodium Glutatmate. Bathed in the Roland rhythms of my parents' 1985 class reunion dancefloor, Monosodium evokes the spirit of Los Angeles funk in all its gel-soaked patent leather glory and casts the spell of self-doubt over Chemist's beastly arsenal. Greasemonger redoubles, launches a stream of toejam, and deals four damage to Chemist's self-esteem. To avoid a potential rout, Chemist pumps up the jam and kicks out a classic from the Special Herbs Vol. 3 & 4-- as any good wizard would do. By introducing the campy Arabic Gum, Chemist momentarily distracts Doom's assault with the herb's BOOM network meanderings. The six-step breakbeat boogie combines with the suspicious brass of 50s cartoons and dazes Doom's creatures with its blatant sardonicism. Metal Fingers returns the gesture with the gritty Four Thieves Vinegar. In stark contrast to the herbs of Volume 3 & 4's childish facade, Vinegar poses a formidable threat, remorsely bludgeoning Seshiro with hypnotic guitar squeals until the snake monk succumbs to its repetitive fury. The match momentarily stalls as Doom rolls a blunt laced with the lunar-landing Calamus Root and pours a pot of subtly hyperkinetic Agrimony to purify the blood and cure his acne (note the mask). Doom then pulls out all the stops, taps all of his mana, and releases the a slew of minons from his 2004 Pro Tour Nagoya set-- including Sundering Titan, Viridian Shaman, and Kiki Jiki the Mirror Breaker. He also unleashes the toporific brilliance of High John. This herb, a favorite of mojo bag aficionados and the sexually deviant, draws Chemist into its blanket of seductive saxes and lilting organics. Doom embraces victory as Kiki Jiki delivers a definitive 12+ damage. The victory herb Cedar spews from eyeholes in Doom's mask as dozens of disco balls filled with the ashes of The Meters fall from the ceiling. The two share a tearful embrace. After an exhausting match, Doom mixes a pitcher of Country Time lemonade as Chemist cues a Tivo'd episode of Malchemy in the Middle.","Having made himself known as Viktor Vaughn, King Geedorah, and Zev Love X, underground hip-hop icon MF Doom dons another mask.

Tanakh,Tanakh,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72713d197565213934a/1:1/w_160/af008389.jpg,2004-11-10 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7928-tanakh/,Alien8,"Sometimes the impact of geography on a record is impossible to ignore, even if we don't precisely know how much the sound has to do with the location in which it was created. That Jesse Poe's Tanakh project was started in Richmond, Va.-- my hometown-- won't mean much to most people, so outsiders will have to trust me when I say that elements of the city are captured on this self-titled double album. During this time in Richmond, Poe lived with several musicians in a former Masonic Temple in Church Hill, one of the city's oldest neighborhoods. Tanakh's HQ was called the Pyramid Institute and they made noise with whatever happened to be lying around. For instance, a broken piano found on the street was disemboweled and the wires were bolted to the walls of the space and tuned. The bowed drone of those strings provide the tonal center for this record. The first disc contains an almost hour-long piece that begins with a simple three-note motif before, one-by-one, various sounds slowly crawl from dark corners of the temple. Some are easy to identify (guitar, piano, short-wave radio, djembe) and many of them aren't (the various flavors of metallic rustling may or may not come from the mounted strings), but it all coalesces into a singular sound universe that implies industry, decay, anxiety, and, possibly, evil. The second disc is just under 30 minutes and features some of the same types of sounds but with added cello and more guitar, as Mick Turner-style moments of blurred lyricism mix with the groan and wheeze. Both tracks are effective slices of dark ambience. This is a much different Tanakh than we've heard on their past two records, the second of which saw Poe moving increasingly toward a song-oriented direction. But here there's no voice and nothing approaching a tune-- just two long pieces of constantly shifting drone. It has something of a classic Alien 8 sound, as these two tracks fit easily next to some of Sam Shalabi's quieter improv releases. It's easy for such records to devolve into a messy thicket of meaningless noise, but the players in Tanakh are generous with space and have a strong sense of balance, allowing the listener's focus to shift gradually from one detailed and finely rendered element to the next. One final bit of history: The church on this hill where the album was recorded is St. John's Episcopal, where Patrick Henry gave his ""Give me liberty or give me death"" speech in 1775. The church is still standing and the blocks surrounding it are filled with ancient brick homes in various states of repair, endless tangles of wrought iron, and dark, overgrown alleyways with broken cobblestone underfoot. Church Hill is, in short, one of the more shadowy and gothic places in America, and Tanakh is an excellent choice for its soundtrack.","Alien8 presents Tanakh's two-track, two-disc foray into a singular sound universe that implies industry, decay, anxiety, and possibly, evil.

Kompilation,Various Artists,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82a9d034d5c69bf3994/1:1/w_160/802bd46a.jpg,2004-11-10 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2055-kompilation/,Kranky,"Let's face it: Any record label worth its weight in promotional sweatbands can ride the backs of a few talented acts and enjoy a couple years of glory. The real litmus test-- as recent compilations by such veteran imprints as Merge and Matador have demonstrated-- is what happens to a label once it begins to undergo significant turnover; how it recovers and redefines itself when its top bands break up, defect to greener pastures, or otherwise descend into inactivity. Does the label shrivel and fade into memory, or does it have the taste, persistence, and clout necessary to reload its roster and maintain its relevance? By this measure, the decade-old Chicago-based Kranky has to be considered a resounding success, as evidenced by this 21-track, two-disc sampler. Most of the faces here are relative label newcomers (only three of the 18 acts presented also appeared on Kranky's 1998 Europe-only compilation) but nevertheless this collection amply proves Kranky capable of sustaining its high level of quality while simultaneously performing the rare feat of preserving a coherent and immediately recognizable (if not easily definable) aesthetic. In the latter half of the 90s, Kranky released seminal recordings by the likes of Labradford, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and Low. Records by artists such as Jessamine and Bowery Electric feel, in retrospect, like transitional works for the label, representative of those zany post-rock days when experimental-minded, rock-bred performers began segueing into the freer realms of improv, abstract electronica, dub, and minimalism. As Kompilation makes evident, this transition is now complete-- there's hardly a peep on either of these two discs that bears anything but the most indirect relation to rock. Despite widely divergent instrumentation and methods, all of the artists showcased here share certain genetic traits: an appreciation for empty space, talent for gradually unfurling melodies, and the infinite patience required to stalk transcendence. On disc one Kranky immediately throws down the gauntlet, exhibiting such an imposing mountain of drone that it almost feels as if the listener has been presented with a dare. The set opens with ""Even If You're Never Awake"", a track from Stars of the Lid's forthcoming album, which seems appropriate considering that the duo has always produced what is perhaps the purest distillation of the Kranky sound. Voiceless soundwaves throb and swell glacially over the course of eight minutes, and as always Stars of the Lid marvelously capture the chilly shape-shifting of ice shelves slowly receding beneath the northern lights. Keith Fullerton Whitman keeps the drone flowing with his appropriately named new piece ""Stereo Music for Serge Modulator Synthesizer"" which sounds something like a set of bagpipes decaying in time lapse. Other highlights of the first disc include an exclusive track from the always-captivating Pan American and an alternate mix of ""Campestral"" by electronic microtexturalist Greg Davis. The only significant misstep is Growing's ""Primitive Associations/Great Mass Above"" which skirts dangerously close to New Age territory with its field recordings of chirping birdies. Although all of the artists here are usually best appreciated in album-length doses, these pieces manage to complement one another unusually well in this more abbreviated context. One of Kranky's biggest recent artistic coups was their recent alliance with Texan psych-folk juggernaut Charalambides. This collection features a pair of entrancing solo works by group members Christina and Tom Carter, and Kompilation's second disc kicks off with the title track from Charalambides' recent masterpiece Joy Shapes. The ecstatic nature of the group's improvisational vocals and guitar may seem out of keeping with some of the fussier, more distanced pieces neighboring them here; but their dazzling, ocean-wide sound and heavenward yearning correspond perfectly with Kranky's broader objectives. More dynamic than the first disc (a couple of tracks even feature decadent luxuries such as percussion), the collection's second disc trips down memory lane, exploring Kranky's recent history. Previously released tracks like Jessica Bailiff's ""Swallowed"", Clear Horizon's ""For Days"", or Outhud's ""Dad, There's a Little Thing Called Too Much Information"" obviously aren't particularly new anymore, but still they all sound just dandy lined up so neatly together in a row. At record's end, Kranky thoughtfully drop us back off where we began with Stars of the Lid, going all the way back to 2001's ""Requiem for the Dying Mothers Part 2"" where we find them still placidly rolling the same boulder up the same hill. Featuring nearly 150 minutes of music-- and carrying a retail price comparable to that of your average EP-- Kompilation has to qualify as one of 2004's best musical bargains. (In fact, if you want to factor value into the equation, go ahead and mentally bump the above rating up a couple of notches.) If you're an established Kranky hardliner, the new tracks and low cost pretty much make this a must-grab; and if you've always been intrigued by the label's output but been too shy to introduce yourself, this is as painless an initiation as you could hope for. It sure looks from here like everybody is a winner.","Kranky offers a 21-track, two-disc comp for the price of an EP. Still not impressed? It has a new track from Stars of the Lid, plus contributions from Charlambides, Keith Fullerton Whitman, Out Hud, Greg Davis, and others.

Monster Movie / Soundtracks / Tago Mago / Ege Bamyasi,Can,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ffea9e61561daa5029/1:1/w_160/da196d0c.jpg,2004-11-10 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11698-monster-moviesoundtrackstago-magoege-bamyasi/,United Artists,"Are we there yet? After 25 years of critical reappraisal and at least 15 years of indie and post-rock bands flaunting their influence, has Can finally gotten their just desserts? I don't think so. Not just yet. Can still seem just a little bit ahead of the curve. They really were ""post-rock,"" as opposed to just futuristic. Can's music anticipated both the musical trend toward decontextualization via electronics, post-production, and editing, and the cultural trend toward collective experience and shared information. Other bands shone as brightly in this regard (The Beatles, for one), but Can arrived as a more finished product and more capable of translating their ideas onto record than any other. And they jammed: Any randomly picked moment from ""Yoo Doo Right"" or ""Halleluwah"" is as powerful now as when it was released. You can use them as make-out music, a drug soundtrack, or just stuff to listen to while driving. You can use them to blast off or come down. Can formed in 1968, featuring two former students of avant-garde classical composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, a former free-jazz drummer interested in math, a rock'n'roll guitarist 10 years younger than the others, and an American sculptor living in Europe in order to evade the draft. Keyboardist Irmin Schmidt had visited America in 1966, hooking up with the Fluxus musicians (Terry Riley, La Monte Young, et al.) and becoming inspired to form a rock band. He and bassist Holger Czukay (who would issue 1969's Canaxis, which used primitive sampling technology) were keen to incorporate experimental composition and compositional theories into a rock setting, and when Czukay's student Michael Karoli turned them onto Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles, the band's fate was sealed. However, Can would not become just another band. For one, they eschewed the idea of a frontman or long solos. Each member of the group served a specific function, but the band operated as a collective; no individual part was more important than the whole. They recorded music in a manner befitting a modern electronic artist, editing together tracks using source material culled from marathon improv sessions. This is also similar to what Miles Davis was doing at the time on In A Silent Way and Bitches Brew, though while the trumpeter was jumping into uncharted territory for a jazz musician, Can had already memorized their instruction manuals and covered more artistic and technical ground faster than any band had ever done. But then, Can's music transcends those kinds of props: They made music that felt at turns desolate, euphoric, tense, and blissful. They were the best possible result of intellect and inspiration in rock, and these four remastered CDs argue they are as ""important"" as any band you could name. Their sound is very much improved. For one, there is no hiss (!) and the EQ is much better than the previously available CD versions (Can liked bass). They also come with liner notes by The Wire's David Stubbs; although his essays don't contain a lot new info, they'll be of interest to anyone who hasn't read much about Can. Monster Movie was released in 1969, and is Can's most rock-oriented album by a considerable margin. Its songs are raw and aggressive-- very much informed by The Velvet Underground's larval trance-rock-- and they mark Malcolm Mooney as nothing if not an inspired amateur. ""Father Cannot Yell"" leaps out of the gate with a hi-speed keyboard flutter and the snap of Jaki Liebezeit's snare. Although the band would later perfect a kind of ambient funk, here they were brawny (though precise), determined rockers to the hilt; five minutes into ""Father Cannot Yell"", the song climaxes with a blaze of bass, drums, and fuzzed-out guitar, and an entire legacy of minimalist rock (from Neu! to Comets On Fire) is predicted. Of course, the 20-minute ""Yoo Doo Right"" is the centerpiece, and gives the best indication of what Can would do afterward. The murky, primal atmosphere of drums that dominates the track never allows the listener to escape the band's propulsion; like much of Can's best music, ""Yoo Doo Right"" seduces me into hypnosis, and winds through a seemingly endless array of textures and variations. Monster Movie is an amazing debut, but would be Mooney's last. He suffered a nervous breakdown onstage and returned to America. Before beginning work on their second album, Can released the compilation Soundtracks, containing music they'd done for films. Soundtracks was released mainly to capitalize on the success of the band's debut in their native Germany, and is often overlooked by listeners expecting only throwaways and outtakes. In truth, most (but not all) of the songs don't extend the same artistic reach as those on either Monster Movie or the subsequent records, but they're hardly throwaways. In particular, ""Mother Sky"" has an intensity matching anything on the debut, and new vocalist Damo Suzuki's presence lends the tight-lipped drone a sedated, half-gone feel that only advances its tranced-out cause. ""Tango Whiskeyman"" and ""Don't Turn the Light On, Leave Me Alone"" are short, beat-dominated variations on Can's version of pop, while ""She Brings the Rain"" (featuring Mooney) cuts out the drums entirely in favor of jazzy torch balladry. Can would later compile a more satisfying collection of non-LP material (1974's Limited Edition, expanded to Unlimited Edition two years later), but Soundtracks is a good sampling of their more straightforward experiments. 1971's Tago Mago saw Can stretching out into the beyond, and it was their first full-length studio record to feature Suzuki. Originally released as a double-LP, Tago Mago confirmed what ""Yoo Doo Right"" had only suggested: Can knew trance-rock as if they'd invented it. However, unlike it did on Monster Movie, the band didn't necessarily lull you into hypnosis via bass and beats. ""Aumgn"" and ""Peking O"" are the most experimental tracks in the Can catalog, sharing more in common with the irreverent electronic music of Stockhausen or Pierre Henry than most anything related to rock-- Ummagumma was a possible exception. Their often-bizarre arrays of sound effects and reverb-drenched, murky guitar sprawl have driven more than one listener to put down the pipe. Of course, when the epic ""Halleluwah"" starts with Liebezeit's industrial strength funk pattern before winding through dark, echo-chamber ambience and minimalist drone (while never letting you forget those drums), the detours seem a lot less harrowing. The shorter songs, like the gray, faintly ominous ""Paperhouse"" or the flawless funk and dark impressionism on ""Mushroom"", are merely smaller pieces of the band's most exotic pie. The following year's Ege Bamyasi drops the haze and hits with a sharp pang from the get-go. Often described as the ""tense"" Can album, Ege Bamyasi is actually the band at its most focused, bolstered in part by the surprisingly good performance of the single ""Spoon"". The proto synth-pop (or synth-rock) song was used as the theme to a popular German television show, and made enough money for the band that they could afford a better recording environment and a chance to do justice to their ideas. ""Pinch"" is reminiscent of concurrent Miles Davis; a tough, dissonant take on rock, always kept sparse enough as to be unsettling. Likewise, ""One More Night"" was dry and efficient in the extreme, though, musically having more in common with Steve Reich than Davis. ""Sing Swan Song"" was Can's best ballad, while ""Vitamin C"" is still the best funk ever to come out of Europe. The band would refine their sound even more in coming years, but they wouldn't really ever get better than this.","Mute remasters and reissues the first four albums from Pitchfork faves Can, whose music anticipated both the musical trend toward decontextualization via electronics, post-production, and editing, and the cultural trend toward collective experience and shared information.

Speaking for Trees,Cat Power,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54dea9e61561daa50df/1:1/w_160/bfbdadba.gif,2004-11-09 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1345-speaking-for-trees/,Matador,"Clad in baggy jeans and a black t-shirt, her long hair hiding her face, a generally unself-conscious Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power) stands front and center in Mark Borthwick's experimental film Speaking for Trees. Standing in tall grass in anonymous woodlands, Marshall plays an electric guitar-- presumably plugged into a portable amp kept carefully out of the frame-- and sings some of her own songs (""You Are Free"" and ""I Don't Blame You"", among others) as well as covers of tracks by Duke Ellington, Bob Dylan, Otis Redding, The Rolling Stones, and M. Ward. The boundaries between the songs blur, turning the performance into a medley-- a snippet of one track interrupts another as Marshall wanders the frame, accompanied only by crickets and cicadas and the wind through the leaves. The camera is largely stationary-- shooting extremely long shots-- and occasionally the exposure is altered, bleaching the picture. The sunlight is garish; the trees are stoic, moved only by the wind. The film, as low-key as Marshall's music, lasts nearly two hours. It's a simple concept, but that doesn't mean it's not high concept. Released on DVD and packaged alongside a 64-page booklet of Borthwick's photography and a one-song CD, the film's naturalism is exactingly calculated: Marshall sings extemporaneously, stopping to push her hair out of her face or swat flies buzzing around a mic clipped to her shirt, and the film wants to amplify these small interruptions as evidence of its improvisatory nature and signifiers of the notoriously shy singer's personality. But these actions are an effect more of the environment than of Marshall's performance style-- any performer in this setting would do the same. Furthermore, despite the high definition of DVD, the film's pronounced graininess does not allow for very much detail, which renders Marshall's face as little more than a blur, as if it has been digitally blotted. Speaking for Trees obscures Marshall even as it presents her literally at the center of the frame. On one hand, the compelling, often maddening sense of mystery surrounding Marshall remains intact. On the other, despite her haunting voice and more-than-capable guitar playing, neither she nor her music is the film's true subject; instead, it's Borthwick's ingenious concept that comes across most strongly. By trying to place Marshall's barebones music within an equally barebones setting, he has essentially turned the camera on himself. The DVD includes three other short films, each of which is soundtracked by one of Marshall's songs and set on a beach that is as nondescript as the woods in ""Speaking for Trees"". ""Maybe Not"" features a mother and child walking through the surf; two girls, wet with saltwater, dance to ""Free""; and bleached-out shots of rocks and waves accompany ""Half of You"". These pieces are just as straightforward as Speaking for Trees, and Borthwick's minimal camerawork transforms them into live-action postcards. They're more intriguing than Speaking for Trees-- and not just because they're shorter or there is more activity in the frame, but because they're primarily visual rather than musical and/or documentary pieces. The accompanying CD is as conceptual as Speaking for Trees' titular film: For one thing, it only has one song, whimsically titled ""Willie Deadwilder"". The track itself is more than 18 minutes of Marshall singing and M. Ward playing the same theme on acoustic guitar over and over. Just as the film foregoes all cinematic niceties, ""Willie Deadwilder"" eschews a pronounced song structure in favor of a short vocal melody that repeats throughout the song-- in other words, no verses, choruses, guitar solos, bridges, or breakdowns. Such an undertaking is pure folly yet somehow Marshall makes it not just listenable but deeply intriguing. Featuring a performance that sounds just as off the cuff as the one in Speaking for Trees, the song begins with the title character and his lover Rebecca, an archetypal couple descended from Frankie and Johnny and John Prine's ""Donald and Lydia"", among too many others to list. But ""Willie Deadwilder"" is not the story-song this first section suggests, as Marshall breaks her narrator's distance and inserts herself into the proceedings: ""The first time I saw her,"" she sings in Willie's voice before switching to Rebecca's and finally dropping the two characters altogether. As the song continues, she namedrops St. Augustine and recalls hearing Dylan sing ""Ramona"" in the back of a cab. She then thanks friends and strangers for specific gifts: A girl who gave her a turquoise ring, a journalist who gave her a sweater, a man who gave her a song and flowers, another who gave her sanity. Like ""I Don't Blame You"" and ""You Are Free"", ""Willie Deadwilder"" is music as a meditation on music, specifically on its capacity for self-expression, and its power to connect and communicate. It's a song about several songs, and this meta aspect never sounds forced or calculated-- instead, it seems artful and intuitive. Like Sonic Youth's ""Diamond Sea"", every aspect of the track-- its lyrics, length, sense of performance-- conveys this idea: ""This is...our song/ And it will go on and on/ A moment in time traveling on/ Even if it is too long, I don't care."" Sold together in handsomely minimalist packaging, the film and song complement each other in surprising ways, but the set remains an oddity: One is too dull and the other too long to be of much use to any but the most obsessive fans-- but to those Cat Power aficionados, they form a strange, often fascinating curio.","Clad in baggy jeans and a black t-shirt, her long hair hiding her face, a generally unself-conscious Chan Marshall (aka ...

Relationship of Command,At the Drive In,by: Mark Richard-San & Ryan Schreiber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12ab1335d7bf16981bb/1:1/w_160/96ceed1d.gif,2004-11-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/329-relationship-of-command/,Grand Royal,"[The following is a partial transcript from the third and final debate between Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush and Democratic Candidate Al Gore:] Jim Lehrer: Okay, gentlemen, you know the rules as established by the Commission of Presidential Debates. The questions will come from citizens in our audience. You have two minutes to answer each question; your opponent may then offer a rebuttal. I will then ask a follow-up question at my discretion. The next four questions pertain to At the Drive In, a rock music group from Governor Bush's home state of Texas. The first, to Governor Bush, will be asked by Clara Thompson. Where are you, Ms. Thompson? ...There you are. Clara Thompson: Uh, yes, Mr. Bush. Do you think that At the Drive In's new album, Relationship of Command, matches the intensity of the band's live show? George W. Bush: Thank you, Ms. Thompson. As Governor of Texas, I'm proud of these young men from El Paso. I take both young people and the arts very seriously, as I think my record shows. But, uh, the question here, really, is: who do you trust, and who do you think will get things done? I am a uniter, and not a divider. Also, you can't hear At the Drive In's afros on record. Jim Lehrer: Mr. Vice President. Al Gore: I'm glad you asked this question, Ms. Thompson, because this is an area in which Mr. Bush and I differ. While no album can ever approximate the complexity of the live concert experience, the sonic intensity of Relationship of Command makes it a good second choice. Andy Wallace mixed the album, and if that name doesn't ring a bell, let me remind you that nine years ago, he mixed an album called Nevermind by a band called Nirvana. The punch his mix brings to these guitars is impressive. So, while Relationship of Command doesn't quite compare to seeing this group live, you'll surely want to mosh-dance in your bedroom when you listen to this recording. Jim Lehrer: Moving on, this question comes from Mr. Frank Lee and is for Vice President Gore. Frank Lee: If you are elected president, what do you propose to do about the inconsistencies of Relationship of Command? Al Gore: Well, yes, I do think this album is largely inconsistent. Right now, music is the most innovative it has ever been in the history of the universe. We have many, many options open to us in these times. Under the Clinton administration, we have brought music into a period of growth, of expansion, of limitlessness. But I'll tell you this: if you want a country filled with records like Relationship of Command that are light on memorable riffs from bands steeped in punk and 70's classic rock, [gestures to Bush] this... is your man. Jim Lehrer: Governor? George W. Bush: Creativity in music is up right now, yes. But rock music for pure rock purposes has suffered under the Clinton administration. They're trying to muck up our loud, old fashioned noise with their Washington politics and fuzzy math-rock. Now, these boys... the singing... either you love it or you hate it. But the important part is, it gets by. It gets by on a handful of truly catchy, anthemic rockers. ""One Armed Scissor"" is the most arena-ready of the songs on Relationship of Command. It has an infectious vocal hook. It has a punchy riff on the chorus. It gets into your subliminable mind, and it more than makes up for the quavering, affected vocalizing on the verses. Jim Lehrer: The next-- Al Gore: Can I just say one thing about that? Jim Lehrer: No, I'm sorry, that's-- Al Gore: Okay, alright. Jim Lehrer: The next question will be asked by Ms. Sandra Hartford, and is for you, Governor Bush. Ms. Hartford, where are you? Sandra Hartford: Mr. Bush, do you feel At the Drive In frontman Cedric Bixler's vocals are in need of reform? George W. Bush: Well, I certainly won't claim to have... uh... invented them. [gasping laugh] [polite laughter from audience] George W. Bush: I, uh... no. I think the man is very intense. And intensity is a great thing. If I am elected President, I can promise you, it will be very, very intense. Jim Lehrer: Vice President. Al Gore: Ms. Hartford, I'm glad you asked this question because this is an area in which Mr. Bush and I differ. Intensity can be a great thing, but is not always. Cedric Bixler has two main vocal styles. Now, one of those is a punk rock bark that recalls Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha. The other is an operatic wail that resembles Ronnie James Dio. The self-conscious aggression of the de la Rocha bit is tiresome, I find, but the Dio channeling is odd and occasionally fun. Take ""Sleepwalk Capsules,"" if you will, for example. In the song's chorus, he's in full-on metal god mode. You could even say his soaring pitch conjures the image of a youthful Tom Cruise sitting in the cockpit of an F-15 fighter. But under Governor Bush's plan, it would not. What he proposes is that we strip Tom Cruise naked, kill his family, burn his house and shoot down his fighter. Now, I see a time when-- Jim Lehrer: Mr. Gore, your time is up. Governor, do you have a rebuttal? George W. Bush: Well, no. Jim Lehrer: Then, on to the next question. This comes from Mr. Hannity Colmes and will be fielded by Vice President Gore. Hannity Colmes: What song on Relationship of Command do you feel most encapsulates its strengths and weaknesses? Al Gore: Definitely ""Invalid Litter Dept."" The slower passages of this song are really not what the American people need at this time, with its 80's metal guitar tone and know-it-all spoken word vocals. And honestly, you'll find yourself wanting to hate it. Tipper certainly hated it. But the chorus of the song is such a fist-pumping, singalong triumph you'll find yourself returning to it again and again.

The Giant Pin,The Nels Cline Singers,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fe9d034d5c69bf341c/1:1/w_160/24bc84b0.gif,2004-11-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1511-the-giant-pin/,Cryptogramophone,"When people think of well-known guitarists, it's the Zakk Wyldes and Eddie Van Halens of the world who usually come to mind. Yet there is at least one guitar demigod who has languished in obscurity and poverty for over 20 years: Having helmed neither a formidable fan base nor a single well-selling album, Nels Cline is a quiet pioneer whose contributions to rock, jazz, and the avant-garde are deeply felt but who will likely never be credited with a signature-model Gibson. Considering all the stylistic liberties Cline has taken-- cavorting from idiom to idiom and leaving his unique treads on all of them-- mainstream recognition was probably always wishful thinking. But heightened exposure is what Cline seemed to be after when earlier this year he posted a frustrated, almost apologetic letter on nelscline.com announcing he was joining Wilco. After a life of devout gigging, Cline was suddenly stressing the often blissfully ignored desire to do something lucrative and, in a somewhat defensive tone, attempted to preempt charges of perfidy from longtime followers of his jazz and fringe work. The charges came, but they were marginalized, and the response to Cline's work on Wilco's A Ghost Is Born tour was overwhelmingly positive. Typically saddled with tossed-off AM radio mentions and the occasional Neil Young nod, Wilco were now drawing comparisons to Sonic Youth and Can and garnering effusive reviews for an increasingly exploratory live show. While all of this might earn Cline some long overdue exposure, the man hasn't-- as many feared-- abandoned his roots, and on The Giant Pin, a new album with his backing group The Singers, he makes sure to touch all his bases. The album essentially consolidates all the patois in which Cline has made his mark, deriving a twisted Clinean Esperanto that's something of a mouthful. ""Blues, Too"" kicks things off in familiar fashion, riding a fractured blues riff atop nimble, slightly amorphous brush work. Quiet and deceptively simple, the song is a pleasant prelude to ""Fly, Fly"", on which a plugged-in Cline delivers all manners of curlicues and arabesques. For four minutes there are no surprises-- the first track has plenty of the same polymathic noodling and off-the-wall drumming that marked earlier Cline releases such as Destroy All Nels Cline and Interstellar Space Revisited. But then things begin to fog up in an orgy of fills, effects, and scratching before a drum machine boots the song into a new direction: chugging rock punctuated with sundry bits of feedback and squall. Of course, it's only a digression, and once the overtones have rung out, Cline punctuates the track with a crisp bluesy figure. That unexpected detour isn't an anomoly, however. ""He Still Carries a Torch for Her"" reinforces the point, excising the jazz influences of the first two tracks as Cline hammers home a roiling psych-rock riff. In the hands of a flimsier player the song might have been a flop, but Cline finds a way to generate intrigue through an extended, effects-laden improv section, showing a side of his playing that would have fit amid the murky din of Wilco's ""Less Than You Think"". From there, ""Something About Devin H."" delves further into formless atmospherics, while ""The Ballad of Devin Hoff"" starts off sultry and slow before building to a roaring climax. Cline has fused his jazz and rock interests before but The Giant Pin takes both poles to heretofore untouched extremes-- especially at the low-volume end of the spectrum. Stark stylistic and dynamic contrasts pervade the album, yet the transitions are smooth. The record is quieter and more restrained than other The Singers releases, making it a rewarding if slightly less exhilarating final product. Whether Cline will continue to cleave himself from the gigging life remains to be seen, but for now he's handling the balancing act quite nicely.","Underground music's version of a guitar demigod releases his first album since becoming a member of Wilco.

Of Natural History,Sleepytime Gorilla Museum,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68a9d034d5c69bf356e/1:1/w_160/84249db5.jpg,2004-11-09 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7785-of-natural-history/,Web of Mimicry,"The shadow of Mr. Bungle looms large over Sleepytime Gorilla Museum: SGM singer Nils Frykdahl's baritone snarl and eerie falsetto croon are reminiscent of Mike Patton's impressive range, and his band specializes in spastically fractured song structures and can turn on a dime from complex meter math-rock to propulsive black metal. SGM's debut, 2001's Grand Opening, was equally indebted to post-Bungle labelmate Secret Chiefs Three and Meshuggah, piling on high-concept irony for some truly cracked prog-metal anthems. But SGM is one of the few bands in a multitude of self-consciously intricate metal acts that manages to retain a distinctive sound, counterbalancing their feigned desolation, difficult time signatures, and adept metal breakdowns with a penchant for melody and arty experimentation. Of Natural History finds the band shying away from overt irony, though not in their underlying concept; the band is apparently a group of Pagan scientists attempting to answer such lofty questions as ""Will the future involve wood?"" and ""What is a gymnosperm?"" In their music, however, SGM create a cohesive statement of virtuoso metal musicianship with the avant garde focus of an art-rock collective. Opener ""A Hymn to the Morning Star"" begins with a foreboding Nick Cave-style narrative that reintroduces the band's self-promoted mythology (which itself varies from release to release)-- Frykdahl casts himself as a cult leader of sorts preaching the virtues of a stereotypical black metal god. The band uses a reserve of homemade instruments, an angelic backing chorus, and occasional music box-style glockenspiel to back up the track's theatrics. Other tracks rely more heavily on the sound of Frykdhal and bassist Dan Rathburn's Idiot Flesh, whose disbanding in part led to SGM's formation. The pulsing momentum of a driving bassline in ""Bring Back the Apocalypse"" backs a maniacal chant chorus, and the jagged ""FC: the Freedom Club"" decries technological advancement (""The human race with technology is like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine"") while embracing a wave of crunching distortion offset by a detuned string section, marimba accompaniment, and field recordings of birds. Female vocalist and Tin Hat Trio member Carla Kihlstedt's contributions add to the album's sprawling eclecticism. She acts as Frykdahl's graceful, angel-voiced foil and complements the band's foreboding atmospherics. The album's weakest moments lack the authoritative presence of a strong vocalist, but the band has for the most part curtailed their tendency toward indulgent instrumentals. The operatic ""Babydoctor"" remains compelling for the entirety of its 11-plus minute running time, slowly unfurling an epic demonic narrative over a slow-building, melancholic orchestral backdrop. It's this newfound sense of cohesion and focus that makes Of Natural History the most compelling of Sleepytime Gorilla Museum's collaborative works.","On their second studio album, SGM balance their feigned desolation, difficult time signatures, and adept metal breakdowns with a penchant for melody and arty experimentation.

Poison & Snakes,Liz Janes,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb43abf31b7dc7155a4f/1:1/w_160/07173df8.jpg,2004-11-09 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4348-poison-snakes/,Asthmatic Kitty,"I know there's a place for this sort of self-satisfied, not-too-alt-country schmaltz-- maybe some Greenpoint dive where young newlyweds go after watching ""Last Call With Carson Daly"", or some hip free-trade coffeeshop in San Diego with so much tracklighting you can see the members of Liz Janes' band smiling and nodding at each other whenever she ""really starts getting into it""-- but I'm pretty sure this place isn't for me just yet. Poison & Snakes is Janes' second album, and it's pretty much everything you'd expect from a seasoned singer, songwriter, and performer who may very well refer to herself as a ""seasoned singer, songwriter, and performer"". Janes can sing pretty well, and she writes decent enough songs, but she knows both of these things, and Poison & Snakes sounds a little too house proud. Technically, the album's ""about"" the American West, and Janes' country doo-wop twang complements her more relaxed lovey-dovey numbers nicely enough, as on the let-you-down-easy lullaby ""Wonderkiller"", the potsy-panny, sometimes throaty ""Deep Sea Diver"", and the album's title track, for which Fifel Goes West And Plays The Album's Token Harmonica Solo. Elsewhere, I don't know, it's all just too much. Janes goes for bonsai countrified punk on ""Streetlight"", but the whole thing comes out sounding like a Burger King commercial. ""Sets To Cleaning"" is unhinged and rickety, but not without the drummer's most transparent efforts to sound like he's completely autistic. The canned piano-and-kiddie-vox opener of ""Desert"" kicks up just enough post-rock dirt for the noodling to hit the seven-minute mark, but by the end the song still has nothing to say for itself. ""Go Between"" also sounds like a Burger King commercial, but in fairness, there are some scenes from Dances With Wolves it reminds me of as well. I try not to get wrapped up in the folk authenticity or ""Who's faking the folk?"" debates about tradition, eclecticism, and so forth. Really, my biggest concern is whether an album makes me feel old, and this one definitely does. Poison & Snakes is quality but adult-contemporary, a fine piece of Waterford crystal or Cat's Meow memorabilia that I can't yet appreciate-- if I'll ever want to.","Asthmatic Kitty's Liz Janes negotiates the territory between country, folk, and adult contemporary.

Acoustic / Rock 'n' Roll,John Lennon,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd3c0084474cd0c2b82/1:1/w_160/63061c54.gif,2004-11-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4732-acoustic-rock-n-roll/,Capitol,"I could see how releasing John Lennon discs called Acoustic and Rock 'n' Roll on the same day might have seemed like an insane stroke of integrated-marketing genius-- ""Why, it would almost be as cool as the Bright Eyes double-weeper!"" some pony-tailed Capitol exec may have exulted-- but these releases seem to have little to do with one another. Hardly the polished, definitive statement that its title and cover photo imply, Acoustic culls demos and live tracks from 1998's Anthology box, plus seven previously unreleased recordings. Much of the material draws from Lennon's most raw album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, recorded after primal scream therapy with Dr. Walter Janov. The new disc's most visceral moments-- a bitter, desolate blues waltz of ""Working Class Hero"" and a finger-blistering, previously unreleased ""Cold Turkey"", on which Lennon's wavering, sheepish-lion vocal veers closely to Marc Bolan-- predict the spare sneer of punk, even without amplification. By comparison, Rock 'n' Roll sounds like ""Crocodile Rock"". Here, Lennon revisits his roots, complete with the heavy, 50s-style echo he was employing on much of his original work (""Instant Karma"", for example). The now-familiar backstory to this satisfying (if less-than-brilliant) outing is that an out-of-court settlement with Morris Levy, owner of several Chuck Berry copyrights, required Lennon to record three songs to which Levy owned the rights. (Levy had charged, quite rightly, that Lennon's ""Come Together"" cribbed from Berry's ""You Can't Catch Me"".) Phil Spector produced four of the album's tracks, while Lennon handled the rest. Despite the legal obligation, Lennon's performance never sounds forced; instead, he sounds unfettered, barnstorming through the favorites of his youth with the gleeful abandon he must have felt when, while listening to Radio Luxembourg, he first heard ""Heartbreak Hotel"". While Rock 'n' Roll is a wistful look at rock's lost innocence, Acoustic hunkers down in the humdrum here-and-now of 1970s existence. ""All right, so flower power didn't work,"" Lennon tells a live audience between the off-kilter protest songs ""The Luck of the Irish"" and ""John Sinclair"", both originally on Anthology. ""So what? We start again."" The fallout of the failed 60s left Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas's Raoul Duke mired in drugs and depravity; Lennon ultimately turns, creatively enough, to ""reality,"" as described in the oft-quoted ""God"". The version here, previously unreleased, opens with twangy guitar as Lennon goofs an impression of a Southern preacher. The accidental distortion that kicks in on the bass during Lennon's powerful, repetitive ""I don't believe"" sequence vaguely brings to mind Neil Young's haunting Dead Man theme. Interestingly, Lennon replaces ""I don't believe in Zimmerman"" with the less cryptic ""I don't believe in Dylan."" As always, the song concludes with Lennon's statement of faith in himself. Still, this is a drop in recording quality compared to the Anthology version. Among other previously unreleased tracks, the nursery-rhyme melody of ""My Mummy's Dead"" stands out against a stark, slightly crackly background. ""Dear Yoko"" (as opposed to ""Oh Yoko!"", which you may know from the Rushmore soundtrack if not from Imagine) suffers from fuzzy tape noise that Capitol's sound engineers couldn't remove. The song's straightforward message of love still shines through-- ""I miss you like the sun don't shine""-- but casual listeners would be better served by the Double Fantasy version. ""Well Well Well"" becomes a heavily phased, forgettable one-minute run-through of the Plastic Ono Band original. Pop gem ""Real Love"" is informative as a demo, though it will merely leave you heading back to The Beatles' 1996 version with fresh ears-- it's proof that Paul, George, and Ringo didn't fuck that one up, after all. On the plus side, you don't know ""What You Got"", originally from Walls and Bridges, until you hear this percussive, bluesy rendition. On ""Watching the Wheels"", Lennon fleshes out the solipsistic themes hinted at in ""God"". Whether or not his years of domesticity were as blissful as advertised, I don't really care. It's a song that Holden Caulfield might have sung after realizing he couldn't smear out every F-word, a song about being true to oneself. If only Catcher in the Rye-obsessed maniac Mark David Chapman had understood, I like to think we might be listening to a new, blissfully mediocre release by a 65-year-old Lennon rather than a rarities compilation. This recording-- originally released on Anthology and the ""Unplugged"" bootleg-- strips away the hopelessly dated production of the Double Fantasy version. What's left is poetic, melodic, homespun-- it's what diehard fans of any band look for but rarely ever find in a demo. Even brief background chatter from Yoko can't throw a Spaniard in these works-- instead it adds intimacy to the proceeding. It's my new favorite Lennon recording, at least until the next time I listen to Imagine. Nothing on Rock 'n' Roll matches that moment, but it has a breathless energy all its own. The remixing and remastering is clearly noticeable-- for instance, the cover of Gene Vincent's ""Be-Bop-a-Lula"" sounds infinitely clearer and brighter here than on the original album. With its staccato acoustic guitar and Lennon's fervent vocals, ""Stand By Me"" remains more affecting (just barely) than the Ben E. King rendition. Much criticism has been hurled at the album's ubiquitous brass, but on the new recording, bouncy horns and newly vivid bass enliven even previously unspectacular songs like ""Ya Ya"", although the cod-reggae ""Do You Wanna Dance"" will forever be a concept by which Lennon fans measure their pain. ""You Can't Catch Me""-- the song that necessitated this album in the first place-- is a solid footstomper. The four bonus tracks are welcome, but will leave little to satisfy Lennon cultists. ""Angel Baby"", a swooning ballad from the cringe-worthy posthumous release Menlove Ave., should have been on Rock 'n' Roll in the first place. (It had appeared on Levy's unauthorized Roots: John Lennon Sings the Great Rock & Roll Hits release.) Unfortunately, ""Be My Baby""-- one of the most legendary cuts from Roots-- is still absent; completists already own it on Anthology, but that's no excuse. ""To Know Her Is to Love Her"" is another slow, pleasantly schmaltzy Menlove Ave. track, while ""Since My Baby Left Me"" is a bouncy version of a cut from that comp. ""Just Because (Reprise)"" is really nothing more than a bizarre alternate ending. ""I'd like to say hi to Ringo, Paul, and George,"" John says, possibly drunk. ""How are you?"" This earnest, slightly silly snippet captures the record's tossed-off joie de vivre-- even if it's not as Rock 'n' Roll as, say, Acoustic.","Scraping the bottom of the Beatlemania barrel, Capitol issues two new John Lennon releases: Acoustic features several previously unreleased acoustic demos; Rock 'n' Roll is an expanded reissue of his lawsuit-deflecting 1950s covers album.

City at Night,The Firebird Band,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda013d197565213b5a5/1:1/w_160/b631ff46.jpg,2004-11-08 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3064-city-at-night/,Bifocal MediaLucid,"The greatest blessing in life isn't health, wealth, or longevity-- it's low expectations. This works both ways-- when others expect little of you, it's easy to achieve an acceptable result because anything short of failure will be deemed success. Likewise, when you don't anticipate quality, you're more likely to be pleasantly surprised-- case in point: The Firebird Band's City at Night. I had deflated expectations of The Firebird Band for a reason: They lowered their own bar with 2001's lousy Drive EP. (Their more rock-oriented debut album, The Setting Sun & Its Satellites, was slightly better, but also disorganized.) The EP was such a cloudy mess that when the band didn't quickly follow it up, I figured it must have dropped off the face of the earth. Well, it turns out that the band-- a duo comprising ex-Braid guitarist Chris Broach and John Isberg-- had been holed up in studios and living rooms creating City at Night, which is a wholesale facelift and improvement. It's not a perfect record by any means--in fact I'd go so far as to say that nearly every song is too long, and a 74-minute running time gives it plenty of space to wear out its welcome-- but the basic material is strong and the new sound is seductive. True to its title and cover art (on which I can see the building in which I work), City at Night is a slick, urban album that feeds off the energy of streetlights, neon signs, and cool, brisk air. It's hard to listen to half of these songs without picturing Mitsubishis speeding through downtown tunnels in silver-green monochrome, their cabins packed with well-proportioned young urban professionals going God knows where...maybe nowhere. Mechanical beats with live accompaniment do most of the heavy lifting as the band piles on synths, guitars, basses, keyboards, and vocals, occasionally hinting at punk but never quite detouring all the way. The seagull synths that announce opener ""Obsessive Compulsive"" set the album's midnight clubland mood. That song is one of the best here, a propulsive piece of post-disco that finds Broach in fine vocal form, somewhere between The Faint's Todd Baechle and The Fire Show's M. Resplendent. Songs like ""Dangerous"", which features vocals by Elizabeth Black, and ""Los Angeles"" are decent examples of how the band stretches good ideas too far-- they each drag on because of grueling repetition. It's a shame, too, because ""Dangerous"" has a stellar chorus and great vocal turn by Black, while ""Los Angeles"" rides a sickly sweet Rhodes vamp (sadly, into the ground). Meanwhile, the heavily filtered, almost jungle-based pop of ""Can't Stop"" really needs to be a two-minute experiment and winds up going twice that distance with no real payoff. The band only slips into a terrible idea once, and that's on ""Wake Up"", which opens as a fairly nasty post-punk explosion but takes an ill-advised dive into hip-hop that sounds forced and awkward; guests rappers JB and Urban Myth of Kerbloki don't fit the tone of the album. The Firebird Band also take less-than-successfull forays into eclecticism on the acoustic ballad ""Art"" and the Chiba City doom and gloom of ""Tokyo"", which uncomfortably rub up against one another. They're not bad songs, but they don't feel at home here either. In the LP's liner notes, the band claims this album is the first in a three-part series. Presuming the band sticks to their new electro direction, one hopes they add concision to the equation because one of the things holding City at Night back is its longwindedness. The Firebird Band have come a long way in the last three years, but they still have a little bit of ground to cover before they're all the way there.","With this slick, urban, and appropriately titled album, The Firebird Band attempt to put their disappointing 2001 EP Drive in the rearview.

We Move Through Weather,Tarentel,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7395e6ef95969320f14/1:1/w_160/d597d842.jpg,2004-11-08 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7943-we-move-through-weather/,Temporary Residence,"Tarentel play fogbelt blues. They emulate daily life beneath a bad photocopy of a sky. While listening to their music, you can get the sense that wonderful events are happening within shouting distance-- standing under Heaven's cracked concrete floor can do that to you. Through a post-rock mess of guitar drones, homemade brass instruments, and drums that knock on every door in a hallway, Tarentel oddly emulates the climate of their San Francisco hometown. We Move Through Weather, they claim on their fifth album. Not quite. Their music is trapped by weather-- like a solar car attempting to move a foot during an Arctic winter. Their sound is usually caught between long, droning periods of stasis, and then slightly melts and slides forward when 74-degree melodies and rhythms set in. It's fitting that Tarentel begin and end this album with a film projector scraping whatever celluloid fantasies it replayed into mere plastic noise-- the human memory can be fragile like that. But if only they didn't title their otherwise mature excursions as trash-flick soundtracks. The opener, ""Hello! We Move Through Weather!"", stumbles into the bitter spring air. The song's sample of a dust-carpeted projector snaps its finger to teach the beat to a roiling tom-tom rhythm, and mixes with a Wurlitzer organ and guitars that squeal like after-hours drunks on a freeway. This exhaustive delirium crescendos and then fades into an uneasy comedown with jangling guitar melodies and violin tones that float like dust in sunlight. ""Get Away From Me You Clouds of Doom"" (how Whitman-esque), is an improv-skree number that's a nastier, more engrossing revisit to ""Hello!""-- this time trudging through Babylon's streets with spring reverb'd guitar and long, high-pitched Wurlitzers chasing a thudding tom-tom rhythm. The 15-minute epic, ""A Cloud No Bigger Than a Man's Hand"", reverses the formula by opening with of murmuring woodwind and string drones. The music then locks into a tribal groove that opens a window to let artificially sweetened guitar melodies blow in and later dissolve into white noise. Tarentel's amorphous but fragile sound is fallible to misfire. There is ""Bump Past, Cut Up Through Windows"", which tangos into a corner to an aimless Latin beat and redundant piano chords. ""We're the Only Ghosts Here"" follows a similar routine, but with longer-faced melancholy in its piano dirge, bass clarinet drones, and a filthier film projector clunking along. We Move's best moment is too brief: ""Klankity-Klank"" is a brilliant minute-long ending-credits soundtrack; its percussion sounds like a stylus thunking on a warped vinyl groove while steam-powered, Faust-like guitar symphonics and digital pricks kick in. The imagination sees something different with each listen.","On their fifth album, these San Francisco post-rockers soundtrack films played at a fog-shrouded drive-in.

Fabric 17,Akufen,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0389d034d5c69bf2671/1:1/w_160/82f770f2.jpg,2004-11-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/92-fabric-17/,Fabric,"The latest installment in London club Fabric's mix series, Fabric 17, is one of its best, which might come as a surprise considering that unlike the label's other recent successes it was compiled and mixed not by an internationally reknowned DJ such as Jacques Lu Cont or Michael Mayer but by Akufen (Marc Leclair). Which isn't to say that the Quebecois doesn't have the acumen or skill to present a seamless and engaging mix-- the record proves that he most certainly does-- Leclair just hadn't yet displayed that element of his talents. An accomplished producer, he is still best known for his debut LP My Way and his process of microsampling, taking small snippets of FM radio, white noise, and other sounds and pulling them together into a coherent whole. Curiously, the spirit of Akufen's hallmark style permeates Fabric 17. As he does with the sonic detritus with which he normally works, Leclair employs only what he needs from the tracks he's selected, shaving off all but only 90 only seconds of some, allowing others to run nearly their full lengths, and doing some good ol' fashioned mixing when it suits him-- most notably on an opening section that blends Philippe Cam's ""LFO Drive"" and the Pantytec remix of Matthew Dear's ""Dog Days"". This inspired pairing kicks off a nearly perfect seven-track section of some of the choicest tracks in recent leftfield techno, highlighted by Pantytec's own ""Alabaster"" and The Rip Off Artist's ""Little Tiny Eight Inch Jack"". Akufen favors tracks that mirror the best of his own productions-- abstract techno and tech-house that uses its more glitchy elements as elastic funk rather than simply as synapse-triggering pops and buzzes. The mix skips and bounds, twists and whirls rather than works itself into a propulsive groove; it also displays Leclair's sense of humor. Leclair crosses the line from sly wit into lampshade wearing when he slips on Senor Coconut's cover of ""Smoke on the Water"". That track doesn't entirely blend well; but what's more, because this Latin-tinged psuedocomedy classic rock cover follows on the heels of a few other more deft FM radio references (e.g. ""my Maserati does 185""), it feels almost as if Lecalir told a great joke but then soured the moment by still feeling the need to explain the punchline. On the album's second half, Leclair reps his country with tracks from Jeff Milligan, Crackhaus, and one of that production group's member, Stephen Beuapre. When he reaches into his bag for one of his own records, it's the Mike Shannon Incision mix of ""Siamese Twins"", a track Leclair recorded as Horror Inc. A little less track-y and little more noirish, the mix's second half features some big guns (Herbert, Soul Center, Wighnomy Brothers, Luciano, Freaks), but it never matches the admittedly high bar set by those first seven tracks. That isn't to say the record simply runs out of steam-- it remains playful and head-turning throughout, and it displays both Akufen's solid ear and his knack for discarding ideas before they drag past their point. Leclair's mix may not ebb and flow, but it doesn't aim to either. Instead, on his first mix Leclair seems restless and giddy, like a child excitedly moving between new toys without tiring of any of them. I guess that sometimes impatience is a virtue.","The latest installment in London club Fabric's mix series is one of its best.

Panopticon,Isis,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b98e9d034d5c69bf5259/1:1/w_160/389cb819.jpg,2004-11-08 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4136-panopticon/,Ipecac,"When people mention ""heavy metal,"" I still kneejerk and jump back to ultra-specific childhood associations: The Bon Jovi/Mötley Crüe diptych in my sister's purple room, watching ""Headbangers Ball"" with a pack of Party Mix and decorating my first shiny, black, mall-bought guitar with Slayer stickers, the trashy Maiden fans in my neighborhood with their toothpick legs, seeing pre-suck-ass Metallica in a mid-sized club with a friend of mine who wore a fake wig so he could feel more the part. These memories are just the tip of the Viking's iceberg; the stuff has leaked into my adulthood, especially via first-generation Norwegian black metal, Mastodon, High On Fire, the Polish rockers who ran my borrowed van into a Los Angeles parking deck last spring, and-- mightiest of all-- the glorious slow-release sprawl of Isis. An odd monster, the Boston quintet has toured with Ipecac rap artist Dälek; had their music tweaked on a series of 12-inches by (among others) label head Mike Patton, Godflesh's Justin Broadrick, Fennesz, Thomas Koner, and Khanate's James Plotkin; and have played both Mogwai's stage at 2004's All Tomorrow's Parties in East Sussex, England, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. They're not your mulletted uncle's bar band. Their album Oceanic was all dark grandeur and waterlogged heaviness, and those qualities define the seven tracks on their follow up Panopticon. Even more epic and swirling than Oceanic, Isis's third full-length combines their velvety, slow avant-metal with Godspeed marathons and stately Ride-style shoegazing. Panopticon shares the crystalline production Matt Bayles (Mastodon, Pearl Jam) leant to Oceanic-- the drums and vocals are submerged, the riffs intricately monolithic-- but unlike on earlier efforts, the spare electronics are more seamlessly woven with the other instruments. A stronger record than its predecessor, Panopticon pummels but harnesses its sounds to a well-honed, diaphanous template. In the grand spirit of over-the-top metal, Isis named the album after Michel Foucault's take on of Jeremy Bentham's concept of the panopticon; the tracks are thematically connected via Foucault's Discipline & Punish: The Birth of the Prison. Because the lyrics are submerged in the mix they're fairly impenetrable, but Isis quote heavily from the French philosopher in the liner notes to make sure listeners don't think they chose the title at random: ""The Panopticon is a machine for disassociating the see/being seen dyad: in the peripheric ring, one is totally seen, without ever seeing; in the central tower, one sees everything without ever being seen."" (See also: The satellite spy cam photos decorating the album.) Considering the light/dark of the Patriot Act's ubiquitous surveillance, Panopticon feels more relevant than the science fiction of Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime. Isis's instrumentation also evokes a sense of creeping voyeurism. Astute track placement adds to the slowly building tidal, trance-like rush: individual pieces blend over and flood to the next. With a shadowy sense of repetition-- comparisons to Neurosis and the Melvins make sense-- the shortest track is 6:47 and the longest just under 10 minutes. ""Backlit"" starts with a delicate intro and stuck-in-the-well melodies before ultimately dam-breaking with gruff whirlpools; the distortion then ducks for cover, allowing a slow, clear bass line, percussion, and cascading arpeggios to bubble to the surface. Such complex dynamics overtake each new wave. I remember in high school when a scruffy English teacher told me the word ""awesome"" should be saved for snow-capped mountain peaks not an AC/DC concert. I still don't agree with his Bob Ross-like language mangling-- both ""awesome"" and the equally 80s-rooted colloquilism ""triumphant"" are apt descriptions of Panopticon's intricacies. Plus, not to rain on Sir Shakespeare's parade: I grew up in swampy, dank New Jersey and have always preferred the angularity of flat, burnt-out fields to the obviousness of your purple mountains majesty. But for fans of such old-school sublime, Isis connect these overstated zero-oxygen heights with sludgy, brackish small-town waters, creating stellar classical music for kids with bad teenage mustaches-- and those of us who empathize with them.","Isis follow their breakthrough Oceanic with the even more epic and swirling Panopticon, which combines their velvety, slow avant-metal with Godspeed marathons and stately Ride-style shoegazing.

The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie,Various Artists,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fec0084474cd0c0ac0/1:1/w_160/0725d0e8.jpg,2004-11-08 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7892-the-spongebob-squarepants-movie/,SireWEA,"As we walked idly through Midtown Manhattan this summer, my girlfriend and I came across a foam-suited SpongeBob posing for pictures with a small group of children. When the kids wandered off, we stepped up, thinking it might be fun to take a quick picture with the famously affable pineapple-dwelling milquetoast. He excitedly waved his hands, but as we moved toward him, a hulking teamster forcibly intervened, crossed his arms, and shook his head: ""We work for tips."" I'll be the first to admit that I don't understand the SpongeBob phenomenon. In the early 90s, animators like John K, creator of ""Ren and Stimpy"", fled the toy commercial wasteland of network TV animation and found a niche on the fledgling Nickelodeon network, whose novel idea of airing creator-based cartoons led to the successful first wave of the network's original animated programming. But as these cartoons evolved, so did their marketing practices-- the congenial ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" came with a prepackaged saturation plan. The metaphorical sweaty bodyguard of Nickelodeon promotion forcefully exerts its presence these days-- and does so in stark contrast to the show's uber-amiable wholesomeness. However: Is SpongeBob truly a model of forgiveness and understanding, or just an adorable, inoffensive tool in Nickelodeon's merchandising arsenal? More importantly, how did Wilco, The Flaming Lips, The Shins, Ween, and Motörhead land on the soundtrack to the first ""SpongeBob"" film? Many of these artists have contributed to soundtracks in the past-- The Flaming Lips rode the success of ""She Don't Use Jelly"" all the way to Batman Forever, The Shins had a life-altering role in this year's Garden State, and Ween have appeared, along with Pantera (!), on a previous ""SpongeBob"" soundtrack-- but here, their original material is geared toward young children. Presumably the artists contributed to the soundtrack because they enjoy the show, or at least want to score points with their kids, but their contributions-- many of which were recorded specifically for the film-- sadly sound half-hearted. Avril Lavigne's presence isn't a surprise (she's the only artist whose audience might overlap with show's), although her Gap-rock take on the ""SpongeBob"" theme is pretty excruciating-- all 46 seconds of it. The Shins might be hoping to cast their net a few demographic points below the ""O.C."" crowd, but their contribution, ""They'll Soon Discover"", comes off as self-parody. The song's cloying hook-- a lilting acoustic guitar pattern and synth melody-- is forgivable, but James Mercer's specific references to the show's characters are awkward and frustrating. His lyrics are too verbose to be deciphered by children, yet will also not likely sit well with older fans. Concessions to a younger audience are perhaps to be expected, but The Shins' uncomfortable middle ground here does no one any favors. The Flaming Lips and Wilco both offer mediocre originals as well. It's disappointing to hear the Lips' psychedelic inclinations reduced to a few grating synth lines, a weak Coyne melody, and an awkward backdrop of obtrusive bubble sound effects on ""SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy"". Wilco's ""Just a Kid"", likewise, is a forgettable mod-ish number backed by Jeff Tweedy's eight year-old son, Spencer, and his band The Blisters. Ween actually emerges as the Teflon contributor, in part by steering clear of the film's content altogether-- the previously released ""Ocean Man"" remains an enjoyable novelty. Most songs are irredeemably annoying, though, even for a children's soundtrack. Prince Paul sleepwalks through the pandering hip-hop kiddie luau ""Bubble Party"", while Motörhead's ""You Better Swim"" is a bizarrely caricatured blooze number whose sheer inexplicability (Lemmy: ""C'mon, Spongey!"") at least makes the song interesting as a curio. Songs written specifically for the film are the biggest offenders-- the endless repetition of ""The Goofy Goober Song"" in particular should make bus drivers countrywide batshit crazy. Fans of this soundtrack's contributors couldn't be blamed for being compelled to pick this up for the new material, but unless you've kids of your own you want to impress, you might just want to skip the embarassment altogether.","The Flaming Lips, Wilco, The Shins, and Ween, among others, score points with their kids by writing new original material for the soundtrack of the film based on the popular Nickelodeon TV show about an absorbent hero who lives in a pineapple under the sea.

Isms,Flat Earth Society,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bea8c0084474cd0c2f04/1:1/w_160/d58437cb.jpg,2004-11-07 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3328-isms/,Ipecac,"At first glance, Mike Patton's noise-mongering Ipecac label may seem like an odd home for Flat Earth Society; then again, this avant-garde Belgian big band would seem like a misfit in any company. Led by veteran composer and clarinetist Peter Vermeersch, Flat Earth Society are well-versed in a broad array of big band jazz vocabularies, and their music is an unruly confluence of Carl Stalling's ""Merrie Melodies"", Henry Mancini's cosmopolitan swank, and Sun Ra's cosmic slop-- all performed with the whiplash attention span of John Zorn's Naked City. The group's previous four albums have only been available in the U.S. at import prices; so on Isms, Patton has thoughtfully compiled 19 introductory tracks-- including a couple previously unreleased ones-- to help bring you up to speed with FES's brand of lunacy. Due to the band's rambunctious nature each FES album displays multiple personalities, but Isms compounds this schizophrenia by drawing material from such distinctive records as 2002's Minoes, the soundtrack to a children's movie, and 2003's The Armstrong Mutations, on which the group re-interprets the works of Louis Armstrong. As a result this collection undergoes such violent mood shifts from track to track that you'll either be enthralled by FES's seemingly bottomless creativity or else you'll feel like you just spent an afternoon on the Tilt-A-Whirl after a heavy lunch of ketchup and mustard. Like many European jazz acts, Vermeersch and FES draw as much inspiration from such 20th century composers as Stravinsky or Bartok (not to mention art-rockers like Zappa or Beefheart) as they do from the blues or other more traditional American sources. These artier influences are especially evident on some of the shorter orchestrated pieces from the Minoes soundtrack like the Morricone-esque ""Minoes Op Boodschap"" or the mischievously atmospheric strings of ""Ellement En De Katten"". But they also surface on longer songs like ""Zonk"" or ""Trap"", which emphasize complex, turbulent arrangements and strenuous group interplay over solos or individual virtuosity. The group's size and membership fluctuate (There may be as many as 20 players on some tracks) but regulars like bassist Kristof Roseeuw, trumpeter Bart Maris, and tuba player Leonaar De Graeve consistently deliver memorable performances. Best of all might be the two tracks here from The Armstrong Mutations, the percussive-heavy ""(Little) King Ink"" and the woozy Preservation Hall stomp of ""Funeral and Binche"", both of which strike the ideal balance between reverence and radicalism while Vermeersch plays his horn as sweetly as Sidney Bechet. Hopefully fleeting interludes of near-perfection like these are enough to sustain you while you chase Flat Earth Society around hairpin turns on their\xCAunending quest to capture the next hot moment.","Mike Patton's Ipecac label calls to order the first American meeting of Flat Earth Society, a Belgian avant-garde big-band group.

It Always Will Be,Willie Nelson,by: Stephen Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b976c0084474cd0c25ff/1:1/w_160/c4d60b09.jpg,2004-11-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5905-it-always-will-be/,Lost Highway,"If Willie Nelson has yet to make the same sort of comeback that Johnny Cash in 1994 and Loretta Lynn earlier this year, it's because he's never really gone away: Nelson has entered his seventies without a noticeable decline in quality or output. The man who wrote Patsy Cline's ""Crazy"" was an outlaw before alt-country was a glimmer in its papa's eye. He made one of country's first concept albums (The Red-Headed Stranger) and was doing standards albums three decades before Rod Stewart and George Michael. He was doing them well, too-- Stardust remains not just one of country music's best covers albums, but one of its best period. But relatively recent Willie Nelson LPs like Spirit, Teatro, and The Rainbow Connection hold their own against his most famous work. In addition, Nelson has been touring constantly-- whether by himself or recently with Bob Dylan-- he's guest-starred on ""Monk"", and he's the only person who can share a stage with both Toby Keith and The Dixie Chicks. Through a steady stream of collaborations, live albums, and assorted covers, Nelson has expanded his influence and fan base across genres and generations. His gazillionth album, It Always Will Be, resembles late-70s/early-80s Nelson albums like Always on My Mind both in its impressively diverse mix of originals and covers and in its easygoing sound. Nelson's plainspoken cover of Waits and Brennan's ""Picture in a Frame"" reveals how so few words can convey a sentiment so big that it reduces even Willie to a low moan of ""oh yeah."" Toby Keith manages to give Nelson a genuinely affecting story-song in ""Tired"", which almost sounds like a liberal condemnation of big-business government. Nelson's gentle delivery communicates that song's tremendous beat-down fatigue through knowing understatement. Both Norah Jones and Lucinda Williams attune their voices to Nelson's signature singing style, creating an evocative late-night vibe on ""Dreams Come True"" and amplifying the simmering heartbreak on ""Overtime"", respectively. But this dynamic is missing on the duet ""Be That as It May"", written and sung by Willie's daughter Paula Nelson. The song is a wonderful piece of country pop that proves she inherited her father's songwriting genes, but she sings in a painfully melismatic style, which-- combined with her country twang-- makes for a distractingly overworked performance. Nelson really hasn't changed his musical style or his creative approach since his first albums in the 1960s and 70s, but songs from every stage of his career still hold up remarkably well. Not only has he aged incredibly gracefully-- his voice has lost nothing-- but he wears his wrinkles like medals, knowing his increasing age just adds more gravity to It Always Will Be, especially the three songs he wrote and sings himself. ""Texas"" is a slow, simple mariachi blues that showcases Nelson's own distinctive picking, and ""My Broken Heart Belongs to You"" recalls the sober, somber lost-love songs of Spirit. ""It Always Will Be"" is an affecting pledge of devotion, a song so sturdy that it gives the album's title a new meaning: It sounds just as timely and timeless as anything he's done.","Willie Nelson proves that you don't say no to the Red-Headed Stranger as he corrals a group of guests ranging from Norah Jones to Lucinda Williams to Toby Keith to appear on this, his 598th album.

Perfect Colors,Mellow,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41fea9e61561daa8096/1:1/w_160/690d6721.jpg,2004-11-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5212-perfect-colors/,Atmospheriques,"I think Mellow like the Beatles. It's not in their bio or anything, but I think I'm onto something here. Oh, and I think they like Pink Floyd, too. And as long as we're playing where-have-I-heard-this-before, let's throw Air and Gainsbourg in the mix. OK, yeah, so The Beatles are an obvious critical hinge-point. It's a fair tantrum, but one listen to Mellow's Perfect Colors and you'll understand the need to view the band through the hyperkinetic acid-scapes of their forebears-- a lysergic costume parade fronted by the Walrus, Taxman, and lonely Ms. Rigby. Fortunately for Patrick Woodcock and rest of the neo-psych Frenchmen in Mellow, they're quite adept at hero worship. It wasn't always this way: Their 2001 LP Another Mellow Spring was a still-born genre exercise with a handful of carbon copys. ""Another Mellow Winter"", for example, quoted ""Baby You're a Rich Man"" with enough larceny to bring charges. On their follow-up, Perfect Colors, Mellow escape the trap of making merely referential music thanks to grand electronic sweeps and plenty of psych-parody. The opening title track swoons with Meddle-era acoustic guitar and nachtmusik atmospherics. They admit the absurdity in their retro-adoration, but their senses of irony, humor, and excess make grand rehashings of should-be tired sounds. On the rest of the album, Mellow continue to reform the golden era of psychedelia with post-modern production flourishes that are smooth and cantankerous in all the right places. They twist the leftfield post-millenial world as dreamt by 20th century sci-fi into cartoonish snapshots that acknowledge their contortions. Here, Woodcock insists, lies the future I fully realize will never be. ""It Was Raining"" is the grotesque Wurlitzer-spiked folk song David Gilmour couldn't convince Roger Waters to put on Atom Heart Mother. As that gloomy organ sets the pace for psychotic background mumblings and a classic-rock drum roll, Woodcock jokes ""Don't know her name/ So I won't take the blame"" with space-cadet drollery. Somewhere, fellow Frenchmen Nicolas Godin & Jean-Benoit Dunckel are checking their back catalogue for missing material. ""In the Meantime"" retreats into a Gainsbourgian ramble, with enough grumbling guitar strokes and amorphous atmospherics to fill its empty spaces. Woodcock's lyricism is an acerbic drift that tackles scientology, drug addiction, and hippie vagrancy. A symphony to misanthropy, its wry understatings centerpiece an album that laughs at its own nostalgia and invites you to do the same. In the end, how much you enjoy Perfect Colors will depend on how much emphasis you place on ingenuity or how much reverence you have for the past. The glamorous thrash of ""Out of Reach"", for example, will be a little too Warhol-schlock for many, but where else can you hear a grand orchestral intro dissolve into a demonic Orff-worthy chorus (""Drifting Out of Sight/ A Place for Meditation"")?","While big sis Sofia was soundtracking her movies with Air and Phoenix, Roman Coppola tapped second-division French retro popsters Mellow for his CQ. This is their second LP.

Friday Night Lights OST,Explosions in the Sky,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd513d197565213b3e7/1:1/w_160/3733a7c3.jpg,2004-11-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2880-friday-night-lights-ost/,Hip-O,"Located amid arid desert sprawl, Odessa, Texas is home to, among other things, the Globe of the Great Southwest, a replica of the original Shakespeare haunt; the Presidential Museum, a sizeable repository of presidential memorabilia (sorry, the arrival of empty warheads is taking longer than expected); and the Permian High Panthers, on whom Friday Night Lights is based. On the surface, this film adaptation of the popular novel of the same name appears to be a predictable entry in a continually unsurprising genre. But there are some notable differences between this and an infamous piece of bilge like The Program-- including the music, which was composed by Explosions in the Sky. Explosions in the Sky have always made music of cinematic proportions, so it's fitting that they've found their way to the big screen. The bombast of their instrumental compositions is theatrical in it evocation of outsized landscapes and emotions, casting a colorful but somewhat phony sheen over their stellar playing. But even given EITS's penchant for excess, few could have seen this coming: a mainstream film soundtrack from an underground band whose fanbase is comprised mainly of scenesters with an aversion to contact sports. On Friday Night Lights, the distortion and dynamism of Explosions in the Sky's erstwhile output has been excised in favor of a gentler approach, one that spotlights the band's skill for nimble interlocking guitar harmonies. On The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place, the band took a less dire bent, emphasizing quieter, more optimistic instrumentals where its M.O. had previously been simply to ""fucking destroy."" Still, that album was a caterwauling racket compared to Friday Night Lights, which features predominantly hushed dynamics and only scant drumming. All this makes for a rather soporific listen. Of course, soundtracks are designed to reach a synergistic effect with the movies they accompany, so to judge Friday Night Lights on its own is to slight it somewhat. Still, this album's movements are too genteel and calculated to achieve any real stand-alone emotional impact. Furthermore, Explosions in the Sky are guilty of the same paint-by-numbers sentiment triggering than the filmmakers themselves employ-- the band suffused its songs with flaccid MIDI string swells and other overwrought flourishes. There are some worthwhile moments: ""To West Texas"" hails Odessa and other barren locales, and featuring a scrappy, ghost-town melody over Chris Hrasky's trademark heartbeat bass-drum pulse. ""From West Texas"", on the other hand, exalts the Panthers players' faint hope of one day leaving Odessa, providing one of the album's only upbeat tracks. Elsewhere, however, twinkling guitar melodies and dolorous tempos blur into one another and merely sound like tepid background music. Curiously, the album carries a bleary pre-dawn aura, a tone that was consciously (and thankfully) chosen to avoid the kind of hard-swinging, soft-landing new-metal fisticuffs that accompany many cinematic depictions of athletic drama. At times it seems as if Explosions in the Sky might not be scoring the right movie, although their acquiescence comes is a nice change of pace from the typical Hollywood rock-based score. Had the band delivered the bluster of its previous work, this could have been a more compelling project; as it stands, it's merely an awkward curiousity.","In which instrumental post-rockers compose the score to a Hollywood adaptation of the popular book about Texas high school football.

Anniemal,Annie,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ac13d19756521386af/1:1/w_160/8ef3f6db.jpg,2004-11-07 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/456-anniemal/,679,"Depending on whom you ask-- and even in which country you live-- ""pop"" can mean a lot of different things. It's a word that's been demonized and marginalized, especially amongst stodgy and often conservative U.S. rock critics. Values, and the means in which they're defined, have been frequent talking points in the past couple of weeks, both in the rockcrit world (thanks to Kelefa Sanneh's recent New York Times Arts cover story on rockism) and in the nation at large (oh, you know). In each case, the conservative factions have framed their dialogue in pretty knee-jerk terms. Most rock critics' views of unity, it would seem, aren't dissimilar to George W.'s-- in the best Christian tradition, it's achieved through converting the heathens and savages. Just as our family values are apparently now defined by bigotry, fear, and ignorance, so too is ""phony,"" ""plastic,"" ""inauthentic"" pop music. Well, fuck all that: Just as (to borrow Biblical terms) ideas like love, hope, brotherhood, and charity should be central to American values, pop is music's culture of life. It's a celebration of togetherness, the sound of universal pursuits and needs such as truth and beauty; of seeking a sense of self and, when desirable, giving yourself over to the crowd; of wanting to dance, smile, laugh, love, and be loved-- and it undiscriminatingly expresses it all to loads of people in a few short minutes. Before Sunset's Jesse may have been talking out of his ass when he said his next novel was going to take place within the span of a single pop song, but there's something lovely about the idea. And anyway, maybe it's not so far-fetched to live a large portion of your life in a single song: Anne Lilia Berge-Strand has done it-- though not out of choice. Ms. Berge-Strand (Annie to her friends and the record-buying public) believed that her debut record would have been released years ago, but fate intervened when her musical and romantic partner, Tore Korknes (Erot), died in 2001 from heart complications at the age of 23. The pair had only recorded one track, 1999's vaguely dubby electro-house love song ""The Greatest Hit"", an intoxicating clubland ""duet"" between producer and vocalist. The single-- along with Erot's solo work and that of fellow Nords Röyksopp-- helped launch Tellé Records and, thankfully, is included here alongside another dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annie's breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals. Whether due to Annie's backstory or not, there's a palpable sense of melancholy permeating this album. She's at her most confident while dispensing romantic advice to herself on the playful, wobbly Richard X collaboration ""Chewing Gum"", but on ""No Easy Love"", as she struggles to maintain hope in a search for love and grapples with the netless tightrope of commitment, Annie's voice barely rises above a whisper. In addition to Erot and Richard X (who also co-wrote the winking, seductive ""Me Plus One""), Anniemal features a trio of tracks produced by Röyksopp's Torbjørn Brundtland, and a handful created with Op:l Bastards' Timo Kaukolampi. This all-star team of Northern European electro-house producers infuses the record with often low, rumbling bass, twitchy synths, and an oddly high-altitude light-headedness-- like floating, high on oxygen, just above a dancefloor. ""Always Too Late"" lurches like a cross between Missy Elliott and UK garage and ""Come Together"" is pure acid house retro, but most of the sonics shade closely to each producer's already signature sounds. For her part, Annie will likely draw comparisons to Kylie Minogue and Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell. Such talk is most likely a slap at each artist's relatively thin vocals but, like the other two (especially Cracknell), Annie coaxes quite a bit from her cellophane pipes and transforms her weakness into strength. Annie's vocals can't help but hide the senses of sorrow and vulnerability that run through her songs, and that makes her urge to get herself back up off the wall and reclaim her once-shattered life all the more touching. And unlike Kylie, who exists in a celebrity neverworld, or Cracknell, who manages to make familiar settings seem like the most glamorous places in the world, Annie's tracks navigate the typical urban worlds of bars, cars, clubs, flats, and high streets. She dreams of ""Top of the Pops"" and gives herself romantic advice in the mirror, yet her world should be pretty familiar to much of her audience-- sometimes achingly so. It all peaks with ""Heartbeat"", one of the tracks Annie recorded with Brundtland. Last month, Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester said he thought it was the best song of the year, and I agree. On one listen, it doesn't sound like the best song of the year: It doesn't do the things that year-defining tracks are supposed to do-- break new sonic ground or spearhead a trend or paradigm shift. No, what it does better than anything this year is what great pop often does: It articulates our most basic desires in an almost irresistibly catchy package. The track itself narrates a party, drinks with friends, and the thrill of a first encounter-- all that many people want from a night out. It communicates a love for music, friendship, and connection, and celebrates the moments when all three merge perfectly. The track's rhythm is obviously supposed to mirror the song's title, and that could have been cloying or heavy-handed, but when that rhythm quickens and doubles its pace as Annie catches the eye of and moves to the beat with another partygoer, it becomes a deceptively simple and surprisingly beautiful articulation of basic human need, beautifully encapsulating every element of human excitement-- guilt, nerves, excitement, hope. The culture of life.","Featuring production from Richard X, R?yksopp's Torbj?rn Brundtland, and Op:l Bastards' Timo Kaukolampi, Annie's debut ...

The Revolution of Yung Havoks,Vordul Mega,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9a05e6ef9596932144c/1:1/w_160/b6196f3d.gif,2004-11-04 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8536-the-revolution-of-yung-havoks/,Nature Sounds,"In any rap unit, it's likely that one charismatic MC will emerge as the star. A Tribe Called Quest had Q-Tip; The Lox had Jadakiss; The Pharcyde had Fatlip; P. Diddy's Da Band had Chopper. I don't think this happens because weak rappers align themselves with stronger ones or vice versa. Unlike members of rock bands, who each have a specific, unchallenged role to fulfill, each MC in a rap group has the same goals: to set the mic aflame, to move the crowd, and to do these things better than anyone else-- including members of their own group. As such, a level of competition enters the music, and in any competition, pecking orders are created. It's difficult to be the other guy-- what you lack in shine, you've got to make up with consistency and resolve. But for contrast and balance, a good engine room is a vital component-- someone has to hold the base of the human pyramid steady while someone stands atop its apex. Wu-Tang Clan is the rare group forged from nothing but alpha-dogs but even among Shoalin's finest, one could argue that GZA and Masta Killa, with their cold, uninflected cadences and methodical lyrics, were the musical control group-- the steely, blank flatline by which the amplitudes of the other rappers' stylistic deviations might be gauged. But when the time comes for members of the group to record solo records and the second-tier MCs have to hold their own...well, it gets a little touch and go. You probably know Vordul Mega as the guy from Cannibal Ox who isn't Vast Aire. And while Vordul's The Revolution of Yung Havoks is a reasonably solid solo debut, it's probably not the record that's going to make you think of him any differently. On the whole, there's nothing wrong with Vordul's album; it competently navigates the stoops, corners, and alleys of the post-Wu-Tang/Mobb Deep, majesty-in-miniature style of NYC hip-hop. But it does nothing to expand the map, staying well within those borders-- the weeded-out, unwaveringly smooth voice flowing over rigid drums, chilly string sections, and bombastic mafia-movie brass riffs; the crisply fractured samples; the aspiration toward gritty silkiness; the greater utility for head-nodding than for clubbing; the same story told and retold with different cribbed or invented slang. Vordul's rhymes are tight and confident, brimming with braggadocio and bolstered by shifting internal rhyming schemes. But without Vast Aire's more baroque, Pharoahe Monchian exhortations to distinguish them, they become a bit tedious before the record runs out-- especially as they doggedly cling to a metronomical mid-tempo meter. And while the stern, icy minimalism of the beats created by relative New York newcomers like Belief, Blockhead, Ruddy Rock, and The Prof would be fine grist for a rapper with more variation in his voice, they don't serve Vordul's utilitarian couplets and rhythmic regularity as well as the glitchy, thunderous IDM that enveloped Can Ox. The Revolution of Yung Havoks is a hip-hop record for diehard hip-hop heads, but it fails to illuminate and render as viscerally as the 90s NYCentric micro-drama rap it emulates. Not that it's entirely without distinction: The energetic delivery and morphing homonyms of C Rayz Walz's cameo on ""Spitamatic"" enlivens Vordul's more amorphous turn. Belief's striated, punchy beat on ""Blade"" pairs with an unusually forceful Vordul verse to good effect. Jean Grae's talents seem wasted on the unexceptional chorus of ""Believe"", but Can Ox reunion track ""Handle That"" delivers, boasting a sufficiently haywire beat by Omega One and Vast Aire's harshly enunciated, conversationally toned verses. But for those of us without firsthand experience in holding down corners and running blocks, Vordul's debut lacks the narrative excitement and vivid, idiosyncratic detail necessary for our imaginations to fill in the blanks and render it anything more than a passing pleasure.","The new solo album from the guy in Cannibal Ox who isn't Vast Aire.

Terra Incognita: Ambient Works 1975-Present,NonBoyd Rice,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c423eb335119a49ed89b/1:1/w_160/a32cf823.gif,2004-11-04 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5830-terra-incognita-ambient-works-1975-present-featuring-boyd-rice/,Mute,"What is more interesting about Boyd Rice: His public image as a fetishist for totalitarian oppression, Satanism, Barbie dolls and the Brady Bunch or the music he's made as Non-- hemophiliac synth atmospherics, cauldron-boiled spells of guitar feedback, and vinyl-loop dissections? Rice's typical media coverage-- layouts of him as a goth-noisenik redeemer prowling the alleyways-- suggests the former. Even without his image, Rice still makes music that can follow you home and lurk in a shadow outside your bedroom window. Case in point is Terra Incognita, a compilation of almost 30 years worth of Rice's ambient pieces and loop experiments-- his ""mellow"" moments. What follows are meditations within claustrophobic settings, where all four walls around you stand nose-length within your mind. Repetition is often rendered as both forms of transcendence and fearful obedience to regulations. The music all demands close, patient listening. The album opens with the eloquent ""Solitude"", a trance-out that loops and splits a Phil Spector-style piano-and-tambourine number. Rice separates the piece into two stereo channels then combines those for a ""moire"" effect, where phantom melodies and beats are heard. The song's three minutes pass by like a year in a day-- the music is hypnotic and addictive to the point where subliminal messages could be suspected. It's steeped in 60s Americana kitsch and yet a peculiar darkness lies within the ballardry, almost like slow dancing with Jayne Mansfield after her satanic baptism. The kitsch isn't out of place here, considering that Rice respects Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey, who wore a cloth cap with horns like a trick-or-treater and even cut a few lounge piano records back in the day. The same sensibility drives ""Immolation of Man"", where a sample of a tacky, prairie-grown country guitar tune is unevenly looped into complete nuisance, along with an untitled track of an Old West player piano collapsing into an autistic fit. Not for the meek. The rest of Terra dwells on sensations that veer between mental and architectural collapse. ""Cruneta Voluptas"" steam-blasts a shimmering organ drone, while ""Father's Day"" loops a Z-grade horror flick flute and guitar duet into a soft din that might be play inside one's bleeding head. Rice knows that dread is best felt when it lurches from the bewildered mind to the heart, as ""Extract 4"" indicates with a dismembered music box melody that is gradually deep-fried by a metallic screech. Elsewhere, an awkward rhythmic attack on a guitar that erupts into vengeful feedback on ""Extract 12"". This approach doesn't always work: ""The Fountain of Fortune"" slogs around a Hollywood-cliche ""evil"" choir chant and a ho-hum sample of a fountain. So while Terra isn't shocking or subversive enough to live up to Rice's image as an art-terrorist, if you listen deep enough you'll sink to your neck.","Veteran noisemaker and Barbie doll-collecting satanist Boyd Rice compiles his mellower moments from the past 29 years.

The (im)possibility of Longing,Pattern Is Movement,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1879d034d5c69bf29a7/1:1/w_160/c5405609.gif,2004-11-04 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6557-the-impossibility-of-longing/,Noreaster Failed Industries,"Every morning I wait at an undistinguished suburban stop for one of the Chicagoland area's Metra trains. The view across the tracks is a power transformer station and the back of a garden supply store. Occasionally, a rabbit munches the scrub brush. The best thing about the station is the bells. As a train approaches from either direction, two bells on stumpy posts in between the tracks begin to toll in a steady rhythm. But that's not the good part. The thing I love is that it's not always the same rhythm, and as they ring, they drift out of synch and make a kind of phase music that Steve Reich would love. Over the course of about 30 seconds the bells go from chiming in unison to ringing directly against each other. By the time they're back in synch, a third bell has joined, this one on the bottom of the train, creating a polyrhythm. This is where I experience accidental music every day, but you can hear it almost anywhere. Music critics tend to make a big deal about complex rhythmic interplay, but I think it's a more naturalistic tendency than we usually give it credit for. Think about your breathing, your heart rate, and the speed at which you walk and chances are you've discovered a completely unconscious polyrhythm that your body creates out of basic necessity. That said, I am, of course, going to make a big deal about the skill with which Pattern Is Movement execute their multi-layered, polyrhythmic songs. This is one of those cases where a band couldn't have chosen a more self-evocative name if they tried, and PIF draws most of their momentum from the careful integration of many repeating figures, building complex latticework on which they hang swooping melodies in a manner not dissimilar to Emperor Tomato Ketchup-era Stereolab, 80s King Crimson, or The Sea & Cake. The album kicks off with Andrew Thiboldeaux's thick falsetto hovering over a burbling river of woven guitar and bass, and it begins with so suddenly that it sounds like you've landed in the middle of a song. Thiboldeaux drops into his normal range for the verses and the band gradually adjusts, ultimately spinning the song into a suite-like structure complete with a dramatic bass melody from Wade Hampton and a spine-tingling interlude. With all of its interlocking parts and strange meters, this could easily be labeled math-rock. But Pattern Is Movement aren't content with complexity for its own sake, veering into direct, emotional passages and never failing to use their polyrhythmic prowess in the service of melody. Thiboldeaux's liberal application of Mellotron and Rhodes piano contributes greatly to this dynamic, and he often backs his theatrical, swerving vocal melodies with simple keyboard countermelodies. Pattern Is Movement also have tangible narrative and political aims. Their most aggressive moment, the stuttering, staccato heartstopper ""Julius"", offers lines clearly based on the current political climate: The truth is all mine/ They are so confused/ It's them that can't see,"" and backs it up with a shimmering coda that emphasizes the missing beats in its odd meter, climbing a melodic latter with a bright flute Mellotron. The juxtaposition of languid melody and hyperkinetic rhythmic patterns is extremely poignant on ""Pika Doun"", as the band drapes aching strings and swaying vocals over Corey Duncan and Daniel McClain's telepathically joined guitars and drummer Christopher Ward-- who also recorded the album-- sits out the first part of the track, allowing short swells in tape hiss and intermittent clicks to do his work. As the Mellotron lament ""Postlude"" draws to a weary close, it conveys the sense of a completed journey. The (im)possibility of Longing finishes as an incredibly well-rounded, internally consistent record-- one that covers an awful lot of ground in just 26 minutes. Pattern Is Movement more than transcend the math-rock tag, and their senses of songcraft and pop accessibility greatly outpace those of just about any of their peers.","These aptly named polyrhythmic math-rockers draw most of their momentum from the careful integration of many repeating figures, building complex latticework on which they hang swooping melodies.

Remixes 81-04,Depeche Mode,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9689d034d5c69bf51fa/1:1/w_160/c9859586.jpg,2004-11-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2284-remixes-81-04/,Mute,"As far as I'm concerned, the remix enjoyed its commercial and artistic peak in 2003. R. Kelly's brilliant ""Ignition (Remix)"" was self-aware, witty, eminently danceable, and unerringly fun-- in short, everything the original ""Ignition"" was not. Kelly proved to John Barth-lovin' meta-geeks what pop and dance fans already knew: that remixes can, in fact, be more accessible and successful than the original singles and album cuts. Kelly broke the mold; with Remixes 81-04, Depeche Mode take credit for setting it. Yes, there's finally someone to blame for ""Beetlebum (Moby's Minimal House Mix)"" and Bush's Deconstructed! ""The remix story of Depeche Mode can be viewed as a history of the remix,"" Paul Morley crows in the liner notes, perhaps forgetting the whole of Jamaican music. But as this sprawling three-disc set attests, DM's relationship with the remix-- from the 12-inches of the band's putative Vince Clarke years to a new collaboration with one of the Cro-Magnons in Linkin Park-- is both long-term and encompasses everything from electro-dub to extended dance remixes to hip-hop to house. It stands to reason, then, that this compilation is frustratingly scattershot. Collectors may salivate over Adrian Sherwood's white noise-laden mix of ""Master and Servant"" (previously available only on a rare 1984 vinyl release), but casual fans-- who, incidentally, would otherwise be well advised to stay the fuck away-- might enjoy Air's typically chilled-out ""Home"" or the first five minutes of DM's own 1987 re-working of ""Never Let Me Down Again"". On the other hand, anyone with ears should avoid Danny Tenaglia's 12-minute ""I Feel Loved"", with its heavy-handed beats and endless echoey repetitions of the title lyric. In some cases, this record reminds us how technologically far remixes have come from the days of simply splicing and extending a song's break or adding a heavier foot to its bass (see: Daniel Miller's fine but rudimentary 1981 ""Just Can't Get Enough"" remix). Other extended 12-inches don't fair as well: ""Get the Balance Right"" is stretched like a Navigator with unremarkable instrumentals, and uber-producer Flood piles the worst elements of sophistipop balladry onto ""A Question of Lust"". Thankfully, at least a few of the remixes add some interesting twists, mirroring the shift over the past two decades toward artists using a remix to transform an original recording rather than just tweak it. DJ Shadow augments the emotional entreaty of ""Painkiller"" with classic soul samples and driving bass. Dave Clarke's ""Dream On"" builds upon gentle acoustic guitar arpeggios and fake strings with nary a hint of the original. A mix of ""In Your Room"" by Johnny Dollar and Portishead scratches and smolders like vintage mid-1990s trip-hop (it was released in 1994, after all). Not all of the more transformative remixes succeed, however. Although DJ Muggs' ""Freelove"" mix is ultimately flawed, its hard-edged, guitar-based approach offers a promising premise for future remixers-- why not dress DM's synth-pop in the costumes of other genres until you find the right fit? Then there's the car crash at the end of the tunnel, Underworld's misguided ""Barrel of a Gun"" remix. I forget all my mid-90s micro-genre names, but there must be one for nine brain-dead minutes of window-rattling 180bpm drum loops. A limited-edition third disc boasts the set's only new material. As with everything else here, it's a mixed bag: Rex the Dog provides a solid electro-house update of early single ""Photographic"", Dave Gahan's lovely performance on ""Halo"" is gussied up by Allison Goldfrapp's accompanying vocals, and Ulrich Schnauss's ""Little 15"" is eerily sparse. The massive record concludes with ""Enjoy the Silence"" as ""reinterpreted"" by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda. Appearing on the band's 1990 masterwork Violator, the original single was an elegant, expressive take on an old theme, one familiar even to Gloria Estefan: ""Words Get in the Way"". But I'd take Miami Sound Machine over Shinoda's thuggish faux-rebellious thrash and his penchant for using Pro Tools-perfect guitar distortion that's as frigid as your ex-girlfriend. ""Words are meaningless and regrettable,"" Gahan sings, and so is this remix-- in all of its antiseptic glory.","If you just can't get enough Depeche Mode, this massive collection compiles two discs of remixes of the seminal synth-pop band's work over the past 20+ years. It also features a limited-edition bonus disc featuring new mixes by Goldfrapp, LFO, Ulrich Schnauss, and the mysterious Rex the Dog.

The Tigers Have Spoken,Neko Case,by: Stephen Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5369d034d5c69bf324d/1:1/w_160/ca15d458.jpg,2004-11-04 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1324-the-tigers-have-spoken/,Anti-,"At the end of ""Train From Kansas City""-- a track on Neko Case's new live album, The Tigers Have Spoken-- a lone voice, low and slightly garbled, yells ""We still love you!"" It's unclear what Case had done to warrant the ""still""-- perhaps a gaffe earlier in the show-- but amid the between-song chaos this declaration goes unanswered if not completely unnoticed. It's difficult to believe that Case isn't used to such public pronouncements of affection and devotion by now; you could tape any of her live shows and probably hear someone scream something similar. Case is beloved-- and for good reason. Her voice is a forceful instrument that sounds modeled on an array of songstresses from Patsy Cline to Aretha Franklin to Linda Lyndell to Kate Pierson. It seems to convey a distinct personality-- lonely and pained yet strong-willed and defiant. And despite the purposefully rough sound of The Tigers Have Spoken-- only one acoustic guitar line was overdubbed-- her voice sounds clear and confident, as sturdily engaged with the music as she seems to be with individual members of the audience. The Virginia native has also garnered an affectionate fan base through her easy mastery and lax definitions of many styles. As a result, Case's songs sound steeped in history but never beholden to it. A former drummer in various Vancouver punk bands, she caught the tail end of the alt-country movement with her solo debut, The Virginian, and snagged more listeners with her follow-up, Furnace Room Lullaby. But it was Case's third album, Blacklisted, that revealed the scope of her talents: On that LP she moved from vintage torch-and-twang and otherworldly blues to sweet soul music and plain old rock'n'roll. Not only did she manage to tie everything together into a cohesive whole without sounding distracted or hesitant, she ultimately turned that collection of admittedly lackluster songs into a calling card by making these genre jumps seem natural and largely invisible. The Tigers Have Spoken crams all those sounds and more into a mere 35 minutes. Instead of regurgitating a set list of already available tracks, the album-- which was recorded at shows in Toronto and Chicago-- includes new originals, covers, live staples, and rarities. Case's frequent backing band, members of The Sadies, nimbly follow her from song to song and style to style. They cover Loretta Lynn's ""Rated X"" with almost note-for-note faithfulness, yet manage to generate a go-go groove that is equally indebted to Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazelwood. Similarly, on ""Train From Kansas City"", Case and The Sadies speed up the tempo of The Shangri-La's original, retaining the skipping snare drum but playing up the bittersweet inevitability of the train that carries the boy whose heart she must break. Case's own songs shine as brightly as the covers. ""If You Knew"", which opens the set, is a desperate plea for a lover to abandon his vapid other woman, and it could be directed at a certain popular hotel heiress: ""She spends her daddy's money/ And she drives her daddy's car/ But what's crazy is the way you think that's style."" The short title track constructs a devastating metaphor about the end of relationships around the inability to reintroduce zoo-kept tigers into their natural habitat, but Case feels no need to overexplain: She lets the tigers speak for themselves. Even better is ""Favorite""-- its low, lost, lonesome sound recalls the title track from Furnace Room Lullaby. Originally on a 2000 Bloodshot Records sampler, ""Favorite"" sounds fuller and more desperate in this live setting as the beautifully grim imagery of the final verse (""Last night I dreamt that I hit a dear with my car/ Blood from its heart spilled out onto my dress and was warm"") gives way to the spiraling banjo coda. Case is a singer first and a songwriter second, and The Tigers Have Spoken is afflicted with the same malady as Blacklisted: Many of its songs are too short, clocking in under two minutes. ""Blacklisted"", for example, cuts off before the two-minute mark-- shorter than the studio version-- without fully exploring the implications of its title, and her cover of the Nervous Eaters' ""Loretta"" cuts off just as soon as it gets going. It's no surprise that the best songs here-- ""Hex"", ""Train from Kansas City"", and ""Favorite""-- all exceed three minutes: They sound roomier and more lived-in. The Tigers Have Spoken ends with two public-domain songs. The show-closing chorale ""This Little Light of Mine"" barrels along like a freight train, and ""Wayfaring Stranger""-- the only track here not recorded during a club performance-- makes a dynamic encore. This version comes from Case's appearance at the ideaCity Conference in Toronto; accompanied only by banjo and acoustic guitar, she leads the conference attendees in a sing-a-long on the chorus. The sheer crowd of voices subtly undercuts the song's lonely rootlessness as Case invites everyone at the Isabel Bader Theatre home with her. Maybe that generosity is the reason so many people seem to love Neko Case: She loves them right back.","Neko Case's first live album isn't the usual collection of slightly re-touched studio favorites. In addition to a few requisite live staples, this collection also includes new originals, covers of songs by Loretta Lynn and The Shangri-La's, and a couple of public-domain tracks. Members of The Sadies ably serve as Case's backing band as she moves between vintage torch-and-twang, otherworldly blues, sweet soul music, and plain old rock'n'roll.

Gogol Bordello vs. Tamir Muskat,J.U.F.,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb425e6ef95969322b87/1:1/w_160/6f76fa18.jpg,2004-11-03 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4347-gogol-bordello-vs-tamir-muskat/,Stinky,"In his work with NYC's premiere cabaret punk act, Gogol Bordello, frontman Eugene Hutz has often been decried as disingenuous; his detractors claim that the band's politics and regional shtick are cynically calculated and affected, and that Gogol Bordello too often play into the gypsy-punk stereotypes they aim to transcend in their music. But in Hutz's case, energy and stage presence trump his seemingly insincere stance as revolutionary Slavophile. When this energy is effectively translated onto record (see 2002's Multi Kontra Culti vs. Irony and 1999's Voi-La Intruder), the unparalleled spectacle of Gogol's legendary live show is palpable. Hutz also has a reputable weekly DJ gig, which he frequently uses to open Gogol shows. He's built a solid reputation from those sets, which take elements of Balkan, Indian, Arab, and dancehall and meld them into inspired mindfucks, which-- in a club setting-- maintain the intensity of Gogol's sets. It makes sense that Hutz would eventually translate his DJ efforts to record, and on Gogol Bordello vs. Tamir Muskat, he teams with Gogol alumni Oren and Ori Kaplan, frequent opener and Israeli artist Victoria Hanna, and Big Lazy drummer Tamir Muskat to create a multicultural mix. \xCA Plenty of apologists (myself included) would argue that in the case of both Gogol Bordello and the J.U.F. (""Jewish-Ukrainian Freundschaft"") collaboration, the live experience is a prerequisite to a full appreciation of Hutz's ambition. The prevailing style has been justifiably labeled ""What the Fuck,"" but the WTF aesthetic comes across as primarily conceptual. Lacking the atmosphere of a convincing live performance, Hutz's spontaneity dissipates and his tracks become monotonous. Each Gogol-quoting horn hook, ""Arab-dub-sextura"" moment, and Muskat/Kaplan-programmed beat feel labored and overly deliberate. Though individual songs at times maintain a distinctive momentum, the album as a whole is fleeting and forgettable, suggesting the exact kind of artificiality that has so long unfairly dogged Hutz's recorded efforts. The album isn't without its inspired moments-- opener ""Gypsy Part of Town"" transforms a trademark Ori Kaplan sax figure into a relaxed funk line accompanied by a lazy Muskat preprogrammed beat, while Hutz personifies the texts that inform his haphazard mish-mash of revolutionary politics as imprisoned wolves breaking free from their cages. ""Roumania"" uses Hanna's disquieting vocal presence to complement a traditional, lopsided acoustic backdrop that stumbles through a repetitive horn pattern. ""Samiao's Day"" effectively replicates the energy of a climactic Gogol drum line finale. Although Hutz brings his crazed intensity to most tracks-- and Hanna consistently textures her accompanying tracks with the evocative, urgent menace of her unique timbre and phrasing-- too many tracks quickly work into predictable grooves and proceed on auto-pilot. For the most part, the album's dub and funk workouts lack cohesion and force, coming across too frequently as calculated combinations of their diverse influences. Individual listening is ultimately taxing and unrewarding, making this a competent but tedious translation of Hutz's DJ sets, and a marginally entertaining side project to please Gogol diehards between releases.","In his work with NYC's premiere cabaret punk act, Gogol Bordello, frontman Eugene Hutz has often been decried as ...

Touch Not the Cat,Jake Fairley,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bea7abf31b7dc715619b/1:1/w_160/c320489a.jpg,2004-11-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3327-touch-not-the-cat/,Paper Bag,"Toronto native Jake Fairley left partner Ian Worang and the electro-punk duo Uncut in 2003, moving to Germany to pursue microhouse and dance music full time. Worang transformed Uncut into a trad four-piece and cut back on their electronic flourishes; Fairley stuck with his flair for amphetamined beats, cramming the dancefloor with singles on labels such as Dumb-Unit and Kompakt Extra, for which he's contributed a pair of tracks to the Speicher series-- most notably last year's tanker-sized ""Octane"". Fairley's singles embody the swaggering warmth of 1970s glam and 80s synth-pop, and his first full-length, Touch Not the Cat, continues in that vein, combining the stadium-sized spunk of T. Rex and Depeche Mode with rough microhouse beats. But it's when he shades closest to the track-y stomp of fellow pop-heads Matthew Dear and Superpitcher that Jake Fairley makes his mark. Fairley has always more pop-savvy than clinical, so it's not surprising that Fairley's vocal tracks are the album's best. Except for his slapdash Lou Reed drawl on ""Mosquito"", Fairley's detached drone is the perfect accoutrement for these night-dimmed tech-jams. Opener ""Nightstick"" is swanky aggro-grind with harsh static slamming against a throaty beat. The effect sounds like Depeche Mode cross-transmitted on 14 broken radios-- a few tuned in but most spitting out static or white noise. Fairley's blood-drained vocals add an ironic enthuasim to the song's harsh T. Raumschmiere-like throbs. ""At Night"" opens with a classic schaffel beat as caustic electronic tones try to keep pace with its steady forward thrust. His voice bristles with recriminations for a girl always missing after dark. When he moans ""I'm losing control/ I'm losing my mind,"" his concern traces the polar necessities of acceptance and denial. The aching vocals give the rhythms a tension to work against, preventing it from submerging into sometimes unengaging rhythms. ""All On Me"" quiets Fairley's voice to a whisper against a dirty beat and a hypnotic electronic loop that's hard to miss and harder to not fall for. The song makes fool's gold of genre-labeling; even a three-piece jug-band could make a melody like this sound stunning. The track is brimming with day-break optimism amidst the guilt of knowing you fuck up on a regular basis. Slowing into the rough electronics and a stubborn beat, the album closes as it opened-- with a highlight. In between those two is a dearth of compelling tracks. ""Prussia"" plods on for almost six minutes without coalescing into a hook, while ""Dinklesburg"" regurgitates the same cranky chime-loop naked of the necessary subtle flourishes. There's no subtlety or nuance, just a cacophonous grind thriving on generic inertia. The only exception is the snowed-in mania of ""Radiator"". Perhaps Fairley just needs a guitar player and full-time pop enthusiast like Worang as much as his former partner's band could use a deft electronic touch. Though each shows enough promise and creativity to keep a lazy eye on, the former partners' releases feel embryonic without the other's complements. Their division leaves the two competing in crowded fields-- the neon-pulse of German schaffel and the null-light of post-punk. Perhaps it's time to join hands again, boys.","This former member of Uncut-- who co-wrote many of the songs on the post-punk revivalists' latest album-- unveils his first LP since relocating to Germany and transforming into a renowned DJ and techno and electro producer.

Yes Yes Okay Okay,The Graves,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c00913d197565213b9a9/1:1/w_160/e719c522.jpg,2004-11-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3657-yes-yes-okay-okay/,Hush,"From the steady brush strokes of its drums to the full-bodied mellow strums of its acoustic guitars, The Graves' second album is cushiony, hot-weather indie rock-- about as soothing as succumbing to the 100-degree heat that pins you to your futon. Singer Greg Olin's husky voice croaks and offers you a beer before it slouches deep into your saved-from-the-garbage armchair. Now you're ready for some dozy, late-afternoon slacking. And then you notice the lyrics. Olin casually drops bombshells such as opener ""The Will Now""'s ""I'm gonna cut your name into a willow/ I'm gonna push your face into my pillow"", as if to make sure you're paying attention. That's...cuddly. Or consider ""Strength in ###'s"" promise to ""Lie down with virgins/ And make credible conversions."" And when the lyrics aren't sexual, they're repetitive or full of obtuse images-- what is ""End Love""? In other places, Olin's lyrics are just plain cute, like when he plays the endearing counting games on ""Connection Time"" (which also comes in a French version). The songs are also self-aware: The record's most humorous moment is when, on album midpoint ""Shake the Walls"", Olin announces, ""This is not the best part/ The best part's coming later."" The band's aesthetic fits perfectly on the Hush Records roster next to Blanket Music and The Places-- but even if the music lulls the listener, Olin's words regain your attention. His humor is sophomoric-- and that's not meant as an insult. It's jolting and invigorating without derailing the songs or playing for shock value. Olin's sense of humor also unexpectedly make the music more intimate: He dissolves the arm's-length distance at which you'd keep most crooners. Olin is here to engage you, with a joke or a scare, and the laughing female voice that half-joins him on some of the songs reminds you that he's aware of his audience. Olin's arrangements are as subtle as his words-- he inserts little ""what was that?"" details with a deft sleight-of-hand: the digital flutter that opens the album, the harsh analog keyboard that plays the hook to ""The Will Now"", the tape glitch-y jerk near the start of ""Holding Your Arms"", the light keyboards that float beneath the album's guitar, piano, and drums. Guests show up from Norfolk and Western and Desert City Soundtrack-- dig the horns on ""Headphone Brigade""-- and when Olin promises us halfway through that the best song is coming up, he's probably referring to ""Strength in ###'s"", near the end of the record, which breathes enough vim into the synths and guitar to wake you up for the send off. But with less than half an hour of music, Yes Yes Okay Okay doesn't do much more than soothe your nerves. While the lyrics try to convey wit and intelligence, the music doesn't coax much more than a smile. Even if a few songs linger, they don't make a deep impression. On the other hand, by insinuating his ideas instead of hammering you with them, Olin stops himself from acting ""clever"" or ""wacky,"" or jerking around the spotlight in an effort to make his jokes. He's just clever enough not to ruin the mood.","Sleepy sounds and plodding, hot-weather indie rock is occasionally pierced by songwriter Greg Olin's sometimes dark sense of humor.

Do You Want New Wave or Do You Want the Soft Pink Truth?,The Soft Pink Truth,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a1c0084474cd0c0526/1:1/w_160/9d3c9d70.jpg,2004-11-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7315-do-you-want-new-wave-or-do-you-want-the-soft-pink-truth/,Tigerbeat6,"A word war will set off the keg
My words of war!
Should a word have two meanings?
What the fuck for?
Should words serve the truth?
--Minutemen, ""Do You Want New Wave (Or Do You Want the Truth?)"" Let's dance with semantics. Perhaps The Soft Pink Truth's Drew Daniel revised the title of the Minutemen's classic ballad just because it's a clever phrase. Many audiences didn't know what the 80s punk legend was screaming about in concert. D. Boon and Mike Watt hollered blue-collar fuming about bosses in high castles. Their lyrics could be interpreted as Everyman frustration contorted into cubist shapes or mere beer napkin scribbles, but the selected passage from ""Do You Want"" is poignant. It argues that political language's barrier is its perpetual ambiguity, self-contradiction, and cliches. On his latest album, Daniel tackles that dilemma by slipping a neon-green cassette of house music on the P.A. when a mosh pit breaks out at a hardcore primal scream session. Daniel's music thankfully never gives easy answers. His solo work and musique concrete tomfoolery in Matmos can sometimes confuse listeners about whether he's expressing genuine affection or ironic commentary. There's his remix of Missy Elliot's ""Get Ur Freak On"" where he clanged actual gold bars for ""bling-bling"" beats or his suave microhouse homage to the nosejob on ""California Rhinoplasty"", sampling godawful surgical scrapes and drills. Do You Party?, his 2003 debut album as The Soft Pink Truth, traced his roots as a go-go dancer in San Francisco's gay disco culture; cartoonishly skewering it all into autistic microhouse with stuttering R & B divas, 80s new wave melodrama, and venereal beats for ""Big Booty Bitches"". The ""genuine affection"" factor rang there-- evoking more passion than the electroclash sold at the time. With Do You Want New Wave, his cover album of punk classics, he's on the offensive. Consider his robo-funk cover of the Angry Samoans' ""Homo-Sexual"", as he deadpans ""Screw your wife up the behind and tell your kids everything's fine."" Homophobia reduced to a sing-along for any rainbow parade. The irony can kill 20 men with one drop. Daniel deftly retains punk's spirit of negation. Instead of remixing the originals by underground punk legends like Die Kreuzen, Minor Threat, Rudimentary Peni, and Crass, he pasteurizes their dogmatism and raw vitriol as disco calls. Daniel subverts by stripping away the distortion and lousy enunciation that cloaked the lyrics of these songs on record or in concert, and reveals their kinkiness. His disco element also dents the ""punk rocks, disco sucks"" ethos of snapping the young n' disaffected outta disco's narcotic escapism with anti-grooves. Although the ever-solemn Crass did release the galloping death-disco number ""Walls"". It's difficult to say if Do You Want is nostalgic for Daniel's punk roots (the liner notes dedicate the record to his beloved Louisville hardcore scene of the late 80's), or a mocking bastardization. Hell, the record could be just a distraction from his Ph.D. studies at UC-Berkeley. The CD's inner sleeve features ""Dissertation Avoidance,"" a brainstorm list of the record's possible meanings like ""Escapist Nostalgia,"" ""Regressive Fantasies,"" and ""Ruining Sacred Truths."" Daniel's music makes the original songs' social defiance sound terribly cute. Consider his fingerprints on Minor Threat's straight-edge anthem ""Out of Step"". The song is now a jock jam with a techno-pop rhythm slowed down to allow cheerleaders to stomp and clap along to, and chanteuse Dani Siciliano giving the Mary Poppins treatment to ""Don't smoke/ Don't drink/ Don't fuck/ At least I can fucking think."" Daniel even mixes in samples of a starch-collared doctor praising the listener for not smoking. ""Out of Step"" is now a jingle worthy of a DARE video aimed at sixth graders. More faithful is Crass' declaration of revolt, ""Do They Owe Us a Living?"", where he razor-slashes with a bare, tech-house beat to let People Like Us's Vicki Bennett tell citizens in the unemployment line to overthrow their society and its ideals of a natural aristocracy. ""They'd live to see me dead,"" she sneers. Unfortunately, Daniel mares the song with wanky lasers and DSP'd ping-pong beats. His digital swordplay fares better on Die Kreuzen's ""In School"", which sounds like a Do Your Party? b-side with its stitched-together fragments of a dozen singers and robots, and a hypnotic disco cover of Rudimentary Peni's ""Vampire State Building"", on which he disintegrates the voice of fashion designer Jeremy Scott. The brazen homophobia of ""Homo-Sexual"" still nags though. The Angry Samoans always tried too hard to offend for the sake of political incorrectness but Daniel's fellow Matman, Martin Schmidt, diminishes their impact with his rendition of Nervous Gender's ""Confession"". Singing through a coagulated vocoder over a Valley Girl-charming handclap, he announces, ""Jesus was just like me!/ A homosexual nymphomaniac/ Walking the streets of Galilee."" And then there's the giddily misogynistic Teddy & The Frat Girls' ""I Owe it to the Girls"", where Daniel and Blevin Blectum duet to a rump-tickling, tech-house beat, singing, ""I can't get no pussy...relief...ride...ice cream/ I owe it to the girls."" These three songs are now dancefloor punch lines akin to DJ Assault's ""Ass and Titties""-- or ""Disco Duck"" for that matter. Firing between the eyes is the CD's design that equates a ""punk"" with a double-arrow bedroom companion. Ultimately, Daniel seems to be giggling at his punk past. He ends the album with an eerie, androgynous rendition of Styne and Robin's Broadway tune, ""Looking Back"", once sung by drag icon Carol Channing. The song is now a funeral wake with a dreary feedback tone that places silver dollars on the eyes of a mourning lullaby about how ""It's nice looking back at the past/ Full of memories that last/ Souvenirs of a life that was fast and fun/ Now it's done."" A fine ending for one of this year's most remarkable ""punk"" albums.","Matmos audio alchemist Drew Daniel returns with his ambiguously ironic, plunderphonic project, The Soft Pink Truth. His latest excursion seemingly tackles the dancepunk phenomenon with diced-up and often homoerotic disco and microhouse covers of punk classics from the likes of Minor Threat, Crass, Die Kreuzen, The Angry Samoans, Swell Maps, Rudimentary Peni...and Carol Channing.

DFA Compilation #2,Various Artists,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8115e6ef95969321115/1:1/w_160/7a15fc8c.gif,2004-11-03 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2032-dfa-compilation-2/,DFA,"Here's a joke: Black Leotard Front's maggot-brained ""Casual Friday"" kickstarts the DFA Compilation #2 with a blast of pink streamers, mutant glitter, and a series of Gainsbourg-Does-Frankfurt whatnots whose sex quotient, to piggish ears, rivals the breathiest, most fecal shit-porn yelp. The Greatest Peep Show Ever then keeps on peeping for about 40 more seconds, when suddenly all three members of this disco-fuck troupe start chanting, ""Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!"" like they're on ""Sesame Street"". It's the audio equivalent of, say, the MILF Hunter going off-camera mid-hunt and putting on Groucho Marx glasses and a Dr. Seuss Cat hat before coming back and expecting us to pick up where we left off. Around that song's three-minute mark, Black Leotard Front play their cheapest, dirtiest trick, offering up ad nauseam a clumsy English translation of the song's Vorwort, replacing the original's self-involved whispers with militant matters of fact: ""I was leaving the office."" ""I took off my dress."" ""I put on my overcoat to surprise you in the flesh."" By this point, ""Casual Friday"" is barely a fifth of the way through its 15-minute runtime, the three-disc DFA Compilation #2 has hardly even started, and there we are, pants around ankles and red in the kisser. If this review was Uncle Milty, it would raise its palms and smirk. ""Casual Friday"" sums up DFA Records circa 2004 with startling accuracy. The qualities that have typically characterized the label-- rapt attention to genre, an implicit skepticism of easy and less song-y dance music, a subtle sense of humor-- continue to crystallize as a slew of new additions (sound engineers Delia & Gavin and the aforementioned Black Leotard Front, J.O.Y., Pixeltan, Liquid Liquid) expand and diversify its often pigeonholed roster. These guys actually do give a shit, all the way down to the packaging and sequencing of Compilation #2, which collects the DFA's vinyl-only releases from this year and more than a few compilation-only exclusives. What could have been a mere anthology of the label's uniformly excellent 2004 output is, additionally, a meticulously assembled personal narrative. This is a label that balances its musical and commercial aspirations with an earthy, no-bullshit disposition and-- let's say it-- the world's best fucking handclaps. Tracks like the lanky ""Casual Friday"", Pixeltan's sub-bass masterpiece ""Get Up/Say What (DFA Remix)"", and LCD Soundsystem's still unspeakably great ""Yeah"" are 10-minute dance songs with beginnings, middles, and ends; people who complain about the downtime on ""Get Up"" or the crass acid freakout finale of ""Yeah"" completely miss the point. Delia & Gavin's Gottschingkind ""El Monte"" and the DFA remix of ""Rise"" are even more expansive, as patterns settle in and flesh out before the next move is made, a bravado afforded to only the most tightly-wound loops. The DFA's remix of J.O.Y.'s ""Sunplus"" wins the label's ""Most Bizarre Release Award""-- the reception to it has been mixed, and for many people this is the first DFA release they haven't liked-- but it's also possibly their most important record. James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy have worked on several unlikely acts at this point-- N.E.R.D. and ""She Wants To Move"" come to mind-- but in truth their high-carb basslines and unclamped hi-hats were making them fat, and it's about time they went on a diet. Like it or not-- and I like it-- their Slits-y, minimal ""Sunplus"" remix speaks to the team's crucial ability to change and stay the same all at once: Their malleability is on perfect display here. The label boasts further variety with Juan MacLean's crooked riddim ""Dance Hall Modulator Dub"" and Liquid Liquid's re-recording of ""Bellhead"". On the latter, Murphy and Goldsworthy admirably keep low profiles in the face of such personally influential living legends, merely trading the original's trash-can reverb for crisp percussion and about twenty more BPM. Old reliables (The Rapture's previously UK-only ""Alabama Sunshine"" and a dub mix of ""Sister Savior""; a fine drone remix of Black Dice's tour-only single ""Wastered"", fittingly renamed ""Wasteder""); and old favorites (LCD Soundsystem's ""Beat Connection""; Eye's remix of Black Dice's ""Endless Happiness"") fill out the rest of this musical annal, most notably touching upon The Rapture's departure from the DFA. Bygones are indeed bygones, though, and if anyone's really upset about that rift, the third disc of Compilation #2 is a top-notch party mix with-- get this-- actual mixing. Along with Beats In Space's Tim Sweeney, Tim Goldsworthy outdoes himself on practically every track transition: Jittery percussive swells on ""Bellhead"" creep early into ""Echoes"" and energize the song's descending figures; the cowbells and clean squeaks of ""Sunplus"" martial the beatless ""El Monte"" and reach through all the way into the beginning of Juan MacLean's ""Give Me Every Little Thing""; and at the end, ""Beat Connection"" fights with ""Yeah"" for volume, until both of them play together at full-blast. In a word, it's glorious, a fitting old-meets-new, tongue-in-cheek gesture to conclude one of 2004's most worthwhile tales. ","DFA Records spoils us with this giant three-disc set celebrating its recent output. The record includes favorites from LCD Soundsystem, The Rapture, Black Dice, and first-time DFA collaborators Liquid Liquid, as well as strong efforts from relative newcomers such as Black Leotard Front, J.O.Y., and Pixeltan. It's a meticulously assembled personal narrative from a label that balances its musical and commercial aspirations with an earthy, no-bullshit disposition and-- let's say it-- the world's best fucking handclaps.

Dear Heather,Leonard Cohen,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a612b1335d7bf1698d45/1:1/w_160/d1a78de9.jpg,2004-11-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1530-dear-heather/,Columbia,"Although this is Leonard Cohen's second album since a decade-long absence from recording that began after the release of 1992's The Future, the reality of his return is still difficult to get your brain around. When he emerged from years of monastic exile to issue 2001's Ten New Songs, it was like discovering a long-deceased relative sitting in the parlor and patting their lap for you to come sit as if they'd never left. Life after death suits Cohen. He's always been a box of paradoxes: Canada's poet laureate singing songs for New York; a voice made more beautiful by its untaught commonplaceness; and, according to Anjani Thomas, ""the only man I know who pairs Kraft Macaroni & Cheese with a 1982 Chateau La Tour."" Dear Heather is the 70-year-old singer's 11th studio recording, and it suits his age. The backing music evokes NPR filler (you can either thank or curse producer Leanne Ungar for this)-- nocturnal smooth jazz, elevator sax lines, and aged hipster tropes-- but Cohen's towering presence and deft songwriting breathe life into the lite-jazz arrangements, a reminder that the oft-abused genre is innately pleasant. The juxtaposition of Cohen's canny sophistication with the fanciful music results in a smoothness with an edge; a razor wrapped in silk. It's fitting that the man who returned from oblivion sings like a ghost: Cohen's voice is almost gone. His resonant baritone has flattened and deepened to a papery whisper; he sounds how Tom Waits might if a powerful lozenge scoured away the rusty pots and pans clanging on his vocal cords. But Cohen has always been adept at turning liabilities into advantages, and his voice scrapes powerfully over the evocative music. Dear Heather continues Cohen's longtime collaborations with Sharon Robinson and Anjani Thomas. Robinson-- a talented singer, songwriter, and producer-- has been working with Cohen since the late 1970s, and jazz singer Thomas has since 1984. Besides co-writing and arranging many songs on the album, both singers' angelic voices paint bright stripes across Cohen's broad swathes of gray and keep them from diffusing into aether. They're the cavorting muses to his bohemian elder statesman, propping up the weary lion in winter as he sings of sorrow and redemption. The dark, wistful ""The Letters"" is a throwback to classic Cohen brooders like ""Last Years Man""; barely-there murmurs slink over ascetic piano and guitar. Cohen's stately stage whisper, ""Your story was so long/ The plot was so intense"", amplifies the aching loveliness of Robinson's chorus. The libidinous ""Because Of"" proves the old dog's still got some lead in his pencil. Over a percolating shuffle remindful of Rain Dogs-era Waits, Cohen indulges a bit of sly self-awareness: ""Because of a few songs wherein I spoke of their mystery/ Women have been exceptionally kind to my old age"". And the title track finds Cohen intoning one short verse (""Dear Heather, please walk by me again/ With a drink in your hand/ And your legs all white from the winter""), sometimes speaking the words and sometimes spelling parts of them-- all over a trilling circus organ, trumpets, and breathy harmonies. This is Cohen at his most playful and enigmatic; clipped motes of ephemeral photo-realism. The second mode of Dear Heather is literally elegiac: More than a third of its songs are dedicated to passed friends and colleagues. ""Go No More A-Roving"" is a Lord Byron sonnet set to jazzy muzak, in memory of the great Canadian poet, novelist and pedagogue Irving Layton, who was Cohen's teacher at the Jewish parochial school Herzliah. ""On That Day"" is Cohen's 9/11 song, which he handles with his usual humility, responding to the scenery-chewing on both sides of the moral axis with a resigned, musical shrug of helplessness: ""I wouldn't know, I'm just holding the fort/ Since that day they wounded New York"". The song's simplicity-- all starry piano and springy Jew's harp (which is usually an antic, clownish embellishment, but which Cohen has proved able to use tastefully at least since ""Bird on a Wire"")-- imbues it with a weary sorrow that casts ripples throughout the album. It's immediately contrasted by ""Villanelle for Our Time"", dedicated to Frank Scott, which recasts the late poet's villanelle as a beatnik spoken word piece, and seems a spiritual tonic responding to ""On That Day"": ""From bitter searching of the heart/ Quickened with passion and with pain/ We rise to play a greater part"". Ascribing a numerical value to Cohen feels like rating a sunrise or a religion; one feels absurdly insufficient. Because inaccuracy would be a ghastly dishonor to the candid spirit of Cohen's music, I wrestled prodigiously with my rating. Was I inflating it because of my regard for its author? This sort of lite-jazz is certainly outside of my usual purview. Would these songs still be enchanting if similarly sung by a less hallowed figure? I decided that the honest answers were yes and no, respectively, but that this did nothing to gainsay the rating. That authorship is a silent but vital aesthetic component of art is a point Borges incontrovertibly proved in ""Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote"", which I'll encapsulate with its final sentence: ""Would not the attributing of The Imitation of Christ to Louis Ferdinand Celine or James Joyce be a sufficient renovation of its tenuous spiritual counsels?"" As long as an album's impact is genuinely felt, it's inconsequential if the impact partially stems from the powerful aura of its creator. Dear Heather is gorgeous, quietly poignant rendering of autumnality. Only Cohen could have pulled it off. And unlike Ten New Songs, I can't stop listening to it, which seems the ultimate justification for praise. Above all else, it's an honest document of this stage of Cohen's life, and it therefore honors his lifelong commitment to unflinching self-scrutiny. With its scattered, melancholic requiems permeating their neighbor songs by osmosis, one can't help but feel the entire album amounts to Cohen preemptively penning his own eulogy. In doing so, he defies Dylan Thomas's directive to not go gentle into that good night; instead he whispers, whispers to the dying of the light. It's a perfectly apt home stretch for an oeuvre that has always been marked by grace, equanimity, and quiet dignity.","The 70-year-old Canadian singer-songwriter releases the second and strongest album since his recent re-emergence from years of monastic exile. The result is an album that continues Cohen's collaborations with Sharon Robinson and Anjani Thomas, mixes his typically sophisticated sound with lite-jazz arrangements and a confrontation with mortality.

Niceland,Mugison,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c528eb335119a49ed93c/1:1/w_160/81d4f37e.jpg,2004-11-02 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5613-niceland/,Accidental,"Lonely Mountain, the brilliant debut album by Icelandic one-man band Mugison, was released at the tail end of 2003 and promptly ignored by nearly everybody. There were several reasons for the record's general lack of recognition, but the neglect was at least partially due to the probability that nobody really knew which pocket to put it in. Was it leftfield electronic pop? Is Ornelius Mugison a Smog/Will Oldham-type bedroom prophet channeling the spirit of George Harrison? Is he a dime store Tom Waits trying to get a new flea circus up and running? Mugison listeners may have wanted answers but Lonely Mountain stubbornly provided only questions. Unfortunately, the arrival of Niceland-- Mugison's soundtrack to Icelandic director Fridrik Thor Fridriksson's first English-language film-- may only further muddy the waters. Not only does Mugison continue his flagrant genre-busting, but he does so under the natural constraints of the soundtrack form, making it more difficult than ever to know exactly what he's hoping to achieve and how far his music might one day eventually take us. As is often the case with soundtracks, it's difficult to judge the music of Niceland when divorced from its cinematic context. Fridriksson's movie, from what I can gather, is some sort of fairy-tale love story. (I can't be sure, since it hasn't yet opened at my local cineplex and in all likelihood never will.) Most of Mugison's pieces here are very short, and several are barely more than fragmentary sketches surely intended as unobtrusive incidental music. Random bits of film dialogue weave in and out, revealing little in the way of plot or emotive intent. Melodic themes are repeatedly thumbed over and then discarded. But even within this rigid, confined structure Mugison finds space to flex his considerable imagination, and the results are as dazzling as they are flummoxing. Tantalizing instrumental tidbits like ""Move On"" or ""Blessuo Sorgin"" combine electronics and acoustic instruments in a way that suggests Four Tet performing a score by Angelo Badalamenti, but they're here and gone so quickly you don't even get a chance to ask directions. Other tracks like ""To the Bank"" or ""Poke a Pat (Take 2)"" find him singing and playing guitar with an almost Skip Spence-like air of solitude, announcing blank lyrical mysteries like ""My bad thoughts have made me good."" Perhaps most impressive are the four versions of the film's main theme, entitled ""I'd Ask"", a simple waltz that Mugison first introduces as an acoustic country shuffle then reshapes into Waitsian carnival tilt utilizing piano, accordions, woozy carrousel rhythms, and pump organ. On these variations we're best able to fully hear the restless flowering of Mugison's creativity and marvel at his inventive chutzpah, as he makes the song's clean repetitive melody sound constantly refreshed and engaging. Throughout the album even his most conventional soundtrack material contains interjections of such dissonance or eccentricity that you're left wondering what could possibly be happening onscreen for which this music would be appropriate. Ultimately, though, Niceland is likely to leave you feeling a bit unsatisfied and perhaps impatient for the day when Mugison can put together another project more truly his own to thoroughly unleash his burgeoning talent.","This Matthew Herbert prodigy straddled the shrinking gulf between eccentric one-man singer/songwriter and bedroom electronic wizard on his underappreciated Lonely Mountain LP. He now follows it with the soundtrack to Icelandic director Fridrik Thor Fridriksson's first English-language film.

The Trickle Down Theory of Lord Knows What,Sunburned Hand of the Man,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5adea9e61561daa51be/1:1/w_160/ced2d4dd.gif,2004-11-02 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7571-the-trickle-down-theory-of-lord-knows-what/,EclipseEclipse,"Earlier this year, Sunburned Hand of the Man hatched a bright idea. After eight years of making music at a near-compulsive clip, the band finally thought to put its newest collection, Rare Wood, on CD and give it proper distribution. Prior to that, their releases were issued only as hand-packaged CD-Rs or on LP, leaving fans to sift through record fairs and shakedown exotic music vendors for copies. But the response to Rare Wood was evidently enthusiastic enough to warrant a second CD release: a reissue of 2003's The Trickle Down Theory of Lord Knows What. Some would argue that part of Sunburned Hand's appeal lies in their scarcity but with music this impenetrable, they're not gonna crossover no matter how hard they try. If the band doesn't evoke enough of a socially aloof, politically apathetic vibe in their music, the title of this album is a reference to the famously-misleading Reagan-era economic doctrine, and resembles the caustic appellation the band gave its charter release, Shit Spangled Banner. But I'd be surprised if Sunburned Hand spent their Sunday mornings flipping through the Op-Ed section of the Times; after all this is a band whose leader, Jon Moloney, told me its music sounded best after imbibing strange drug cocktails. But one need not be too wrecked to enjoy Trickle Down. It's a more engrossing beast than its predecessor. It dominates any environment in which it's played, coaxing the listener into a trance-like state through its use of endlessly repetitive phrases, distant and heavily reverbed vocals, and sustained textures. Much of Sunburned's music is like this but whereas previous releases such as Headdress are more blissed out, Trickle Down is darker and more meditative. The opening track, ""Spell it Out"", is even propelled by unintelligible, Shaman-esque chanting. Appropriately enough for this unalloyed collection of left-as-is jams, the track cuts off abruptly just as its lumbering central rhythm seems to be picking up. Five of the record's tracks end with a curt clip followed by a snippet of a seemingly unrelated bit of music. ""Show of Hands"" is the album's effulgent anomaly, a track on which the ambience is turned down and one can actually hear plaintive acoustic and electric guitar dabbles poking through the mix. From the warm and fuzzy but distant guitar sound to the scattered vocal ruminations, Trickle Down is conspicuously lo-fi, even by Sunburned Hand standards. We're talking one or two mics here, tops, but the poor quality only enhances the album's immersive, otherworldly aura. ""The Easy Ease"" and ""Always Correct"" are the album's shortest and quietest tracks. They're also the least interesting. The former does without rhythm, relying instead on warped wormhole drones and occasional flashes of cymbal; the latter is basically a drum circle. The songs aren't bad, merely soporific, and only inhibit the flow of the album insofar as they might cause the listener to black out. But whatever Sunburned Hand lack in consistency they sure know how to make up for with superb finales. On the somewhat disappointing Rare Wood, the band saved grace with the fantastic ""Gyp Hawkin'"", a verdant, synth-spotted gem that trod through 10 minutes of wayward improvising without losing its mystic groove. Here, the closer again provides the strongest number. ""Rivershine"" siphons the piecemeal drone-and-moan of the previous four tracks into a momentous build-up that goes up, up, and away, tearing through each layer of the atmosphere in a torrid ascent to stellar calm. Once the band break through, it's a slow, steady drift, Earth in the rearview along with all the politics and formalities they never cared much for anyway.","Just one year after it was released on CDR and LP, Sunburned Hand of the Man decide that, what the hell, the general CD-buying population should be able to hear their record as well.

"Shotgun Wedding Vol. 3: Oh, So Now You Fuckers Wanna Dance?",CexKid606,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb86ea9e61561daa726b/1:1/w_160/ded9bff5.gif,2004-11-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4410-shotgun-wedding-vol-3-oh-so-now-you-fuckers-wanna-dance-with-cex/,Violent Turd,"""Sometimes the mainstream is more interesting than the underground,"" DJ/rupture told me before mating eight-legged raggacore beats with bling-bling socialites at San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill club. I had previously asked him why so many underground noiseniks were enthralled with Timbaland and the Neptunes' six-figure-charged per beat productions, and rupture further elaborated his answer onstage as he mixed with no trace of irony or contempt. His comrade and laptop-noise sevngali Kid606 also fondly connected the dots between noise and pop during a DJ set at the city's Peacock Lounge-- having the Tom Tom Club's ""Genius of Love"" understandably crawl into bed with hardcore techno. The audience of shag-carpeted art students inhaled it all. On Oh, So Now You Fuckers Wanna Dance?, the Kid (Miguel Depedro) and cult-rapper Cex (Rjyan Kidwell) continue to damn the underground's isolationism from the mainstream by concocting DJ mixtapes for high school halftime shows. In short, it's gallantly dumb booty music that is often a foot away from being meat-market fodder. The record is the third chapter in ""soundclash"" label Violent Turd's Shotgun Wedding series where copyright-abusing artists split time on the same mix record. Cex and the Kid's 20-30 minute DJ sets mostly avoid DSP vandalism in favor of letting their Miami bass-style THUNK, THUNK, THUNKs and MTV-sold rappers speak for themselves. That deep respect also compromises their strong personalities. Miguel is known for shattering techno and hip-hop into a million pieces, and later prancing about in Hello Kitty/Paul Frank synth-pop to further disturb; Rjyan defies any anti-white rapper critic by existing in his genuine world of parody, video-game addiction relapses, and counter-IDM ethic. So although the dumb-dance aesthetic isn't a radical departure from their oeuvres, it'd still be nice to hear them disrupt and baffle the dancefloor with whatthefuckwasthat? moments. Miguel's ""Up From DaBassment"" locks a booty-groove that for all of its 26 minutes is all caffeinated high and no relief. He sticks to a few rhythms all cranked up to +50 on his turntables' pitch controls. Stumbling into the room and asking everyone if they're at the right party before leaving are 50 Cent, Le Tigre, 'Lil Kim, Busta Rhymes, Black Flag, Trick Daddy, Elephant Man, Outkast, the Cardigans, and Daft Punk. Miguel then eases things down with Sparklehorse and Electric Company's shimmering guitar ballads. His next set, ""Gizm Collission"" is intoxicated with an acid hardcore vibe that begins with his own Amsterdam 4:20 street hootenanny ""The Illness"" and then indulges in four sexual predator anthems from DJ Assault. Aphex Twin's peyote-oiled didgeridoo steals the show and refreshingly opens up a vivid mindscape amid the percussive bludgeons. Cex's ""DJ No Evil BaltiMix 6000"" is a more produced affair-- chopping up samples beyond recognition and rhythmically looping them to near-overkill. Half of his set glides on the Jungle Brothers' classic ""Sounds of the Safari"" breakbeat where the snapped beats seems to strut a few inches above the ground. Megaphone-amplified crunk-hollers and Pepsi-commercial stabs of melodies also abound, with a brilliant moment of Motown-soul upping the funk. Despite expectations of timely subversion, who cares if Cex and the Kid don't toss molotov cocktails at the mainstream? Especially when music like this can make the dancefloor undead. As what the ""Genius of Love"" taught us: ""Who needs to think when your feet just go?""","Violent Turd offers the third installment in the Shotgun Wedding series, in which a pair of artists each contribute their own DJ set to the same disc.

Gold Medal,The Donnas,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f99d034d5c69bf5351/1:1/w_160/d49e1066.jpg,2004-11-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2422-gold-medal/,Interscope,"The Donnas used to wrap up their tracks within two minutes. Their songs were cheeky punchlines-- ""Skintight"", ""Do You Wanna Hit It"", and ""All Messed Up""-- and they all had the same set of purrs, sneers, and distortion. Albums titles like Turn 21 and Spend the Night were equally problematic-- nodding and winking, they seemed to trace the band's career alongside websites tracking the Olsen twins' crawl toward legal age. Even after Spend the Night's sole thrill, ""Take It Off"", afforded The Donnas some grown-up success and MTV exposure, the group still seemed happy playing the role of teen-movie house band. Gold Medal tries to remedy that reputation with richer songwriting and a thicker sonic tip. In other words, it's not all riffs and swears. New ideas have appeared inside the Donnas' old put-up-your-dukes, pull-down-your-pants swagger; instead of constantly rewriting rock 'n' roll radio, they're dutifully working towards a unique sound. ""Don't Break Me Down"" burns slow and pays off with a chorus as subtle as the chilly bassline which runs throughout the track. It could be one of those occasional gems you hear on Loud 107's ""Turn Back the Rock"" weekend, right after the 700 millionth spin of ""Sweet Emotion"". Even a track like ""Friends Like Mine""-- despite placeholder lyrics and a pick-slide opening-- has more going for it than the typical Donnas songs. Much of the credit goes to Allison Robertson (formerly Donna R.-- the girls have finally done away with the Ramones-baiting aliases), whose guitar work has grown stronger with each album, but here she's really tearing it up, giving Gold Medal a more dynamic feel. In the album's best stretches, the Donnas layer their image and influences over something they can call their own. Butch Walker deserves some credit for this transformation. His production is subtle, but it always highlights the right element of a song, whether it's the extra spice on Robertson's guitar in ""Friends"" or the continued emphasis on Brett Anderson's throaty vocals. For once she sounds more like a true frontperson than just the bitchy girl in the back of class. Unfortunately, the increased vocal presence also emphasizes Anderson's lyrical weaknesses. ""It's so hard to be on your own/ When you're holdin' it all alone."" Right. Fortunately Walker is always just a knob twist away from another saving grace. He integrates the album's array of backing vocals and handclaps, makes Maya Ford's formerly inaudible bass a true force, and amplifies Robertson's solos in ways that avoid miring them in cliches. He knows hard rock can't fully outrun cliche, which means the Donnas can't either. It's just party music, after all. But ideally, it still has some breadth-- the party extending beyond the kitchen-- and with Walker's help, The Donnas have fit the pieces together better than usual. But Gold Medal is still too flawed to be The Donnas' finest hour. ""It's So Hard"" is another one of those loudmouth punchlines that fails to go anywhere, and lead single ""Fall Behind Me""-- as great as its twin-channel guitars sound-- isn't strong enough to compete in the current Return to Rock sweepstakes. ""Revolver"" goes for an acoustic/electric hybrid, but it's as empty as an album track from one of the junior Avril hopefuls. The title track is a slight improvement-- it's also acoustic, but has a great vocal hook in the chorus and ""ooh-wah-ooh"" harmonies that put it closer to Dreamboat Annie than The Donnas' usual Kiss 'n' Crüe strut. The recycled riffs and too-easy lyrical cheese are occasionally still in play. But on Gold Medal, even when they fail, it seems as if that failure is a result of The Donnas trying to carve their own identity rather than just being a cute cover band that ran out of ideas.","On their sixth album, The Donnas go for the sometimes dreaded ""mature"" approach by emphasizing craft, dropping their ""Donna"" tags in favor of their given names, and extending their track lengths.

Below the Radio,Grandaddy,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf8deb335119a49ed23a/1:1/w_160/aa71ee52.jpg,2004-11-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3548-below-the-radio/,Ultra,"The box-office nosedive of The Real Cancun-- a throwaway cockumentary that combined The Real World with Girls Gone Wild-- taught the purveyors of this junk culture a painful lesson: Americans love reality-based entertainment as long as its free. Below the Radio, an album of songs compiled by Grandaddy's Jason Lytle, might prove to be a similar acid test for the indie fan's mixtape. You probably enjoy making, giving, and receiving mixes. The question is whether or not you're willing to pay regular CD price for one, even taking into consideration that its creator is an indie celebrity of, presumably, the most refined and immaculate tastes. Mixtapes are great for self-expression, for deepening interpersonal relationships, and for allowing non-musicians to participate in creating music's context. The creation of a successful mixtape is a delicate, nuanced art, and the phrase itself is so entrenched that it persists despite the primacy of CDs. But it seems dubious that such a populist, grassroots phenomenon can make the transition to regulated commerce and remain intact-- can Lytle's offering truly even be considered a mixtape? Collecting previously released music from various rock bands on a CD isn't a new idea; we simply call them compilations instead of mixes, which identifies by omission a couple crucial characteristics of the mixtape-- it must be free, and created specifically for the recipient. As such, Lytle's mix seems like a compilation in disguise. It was created for an unknown audience, and he sure as hell isn't giving it away. But while most compilations are united by a theme such as genre, label, time period, or subject matter, Lytle's is built upon the mixtape keystone of Songs I Like, and is being marketed as one as well. Often, the tapes you or I make are influenced by their recipients-- romantic songs for a significant other, heartbreaking songs for an ex, songs with happy associations for friends with shared history, etc. Since Lytle's mix is for strangers who only know him through his music, it seems prudent that, for the most part, the songs he selected sound quite a bit like his own band. Lush yet sleek and slightly sterile is the dominant style of Below the Radio, and one can easily imagine Grandaddy playing Beck's weary, 50s-style pop ballad ""We Live Again"", Beulah's gleaming, harmony-laden ""Burned by the Sun"", Earlimart's creeping wash of beeps and strings, ""Color Bars"", and Snow Patrol's frosty guitar anthem ""Run"". Because the songs are so redolent of Grandaddy, Below the Radio has a sense of continuity. The record flows through a polished initial section that culminates with the velvety jangle-pop of Goldenboy's ""Wild Was the Night"" and then shifts to a looser mode that includes Fruit Bats' comparatively shambolic ""The Little Acorn"", the four-track folk and cracking vocals of Home's ""Comin' Up Empty Again"", and the rickety, key-hopping charm of Little Wings' ""Sand Canyon""-- the melody of which is strikingly similar to the Decemberists' ""I Was Meant for the Stage"". So the mix is well-sequenced, with no jarring transitions and even some that are ingeniously seamless (the percolating drone that closes Beulah's track seems to naturally birth the heart-rate monitor pulse that opens Earlimart's). The record is closed by its only previously unreleased track, Grandaddy's ""Nature Anthem"", a pleasant if undistinguished campfire sing-along that reasserts Lytle's kindred spirit with the songs he selected. Lytle should also be credited for avoiding obfuscation. Let's not shit ourselves-- when we make mixes, we don't always just choose songs we hope the recipient will enjoy. We create palimpsests of our personalities, and the urge to fudge is strong. You know that Swell Maps song you always put on mixes even though you never listen to it, knowing that the recipient will be impressed and pretend to like it as well? That's not included here. There are no hipster oddities or historical remnants on Below the Radio. The oldest and probably weirdest track is Pavement's 1995 melange of detuned organs and ratcheting embellishments, ""Motion Suggests"". Instead of presenting us with difficult, cool songs we'll start skipping after a couple listens, Lytle has packed his mix with more melodic and accessible fare, which is admirable-- if it's hard for us not to want one person to think we like Merzbow, how hard would it be to pass up the chance to make thousands think we like Merzbow? There's one more mixtape pleasure that we've yet to address-- on any good mix, the listener will inevitably come away with a new band to cherish and seek out. Somehow, until I heard Below the Radio, I'd managed to avoid ever listening to Giant Sand. After hearing ""Bottom Line Man""-- a lovely, sly ballad that closely resembles one of my favorite bands, Silver Jews-- this will certainly be remedied. The discovery of a new favorite is worth the price of admission; perhaps there's a similar treasure for you to exhume from Below the Radio, or an old favorite to rediscover. ","This Grandaddy-curated collection of bands who sort of sound like, erm, Grandaddy (Beck, Snow Patrol, Beulah, and Earlimart, among others) is like a mixtape that Jason Lytle made especially for you-- and you, and you, and you. Among its biggest draws is ""Nature Anthem"", a new track from Granddady themselves.

Breach EP,Shivaree,by: Stephen Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a689c0084474cd0c09b7/1:1/w_160/38b6d373.gif,2004-10-31 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7784-breach-ep/,Zoe,"Shivaree's 1999 debut, I Oughtta Give You a Shot in the Head for Making Me Live in This Dump, served up a bolt of spooked Americana full of eclectic sounds and randy songs about spankings and cannibals. It flirted with cartoonishness, but thanks to the band's inventive overlay of organic and synthetic sounds and singer Ambrosia Parsley's honey-and-barbed-wire voice was ultimately more substantive. Despite that record's glowing reviews and Shivaree's modest audience, their 2002 follow-up, Rough Dreams, never saw release in the U.S.; to this day, it's available to American listeners only as a pricey import. Earlier this year, ""Goodnight Moon""-- a standout track from I Oughtta Give You-- was included on the Kill Bill 2 soundtrack, introducing Shivaree to a wider audience. Perhaps as a result of that exposure, the band's third full-length, Who's Got Trouble?, is slated for domestic release in January, with this EP, Breach, preceding it by a few months. As its name implies, Breach is something like a partial birth: In addition to two new covers and a non-album track, the EP contains two songs from Who's Got Trouble? One of those is a cover of Brian Eno's ""The Fat Lady of Limbourg"", which Shivaree translates into a covert ops blues strut, driven by Danny McGough's chugging organ. Replacing Eno's saxophone with a guitar and piano, the song sounds evocatively conspiratorial-- topical in a vague way, but never overbearing-- as it describes a Pynchonesque underground network of agents, operatives, and waxen eggs. Compared to that song, ""I Close My Eyes"" proves less of a departure for the band-- it would sound right at home on I Should Give You but it shows off their collective strengths to much better effect. It sounds like a cousin to ""Goodnight Moon"": both have strong melodies and instant hooks with lyrics about domestic ingenuity. Where ""Goodnight Moon"" was about the fear of being home alone and the precautions taken against imagined predators, on ""I Close My Eyes"" Parsley sings from the perspective of a beleaguered mother: ""I close my eyes so I can dream of ways to keep you occupied/ So I can lock you up and we'll keep it classified."" Whether she's addressing that statement to the child or the father is unclear, but Parsley sounds conniving instead of whining, certain she'll get her way if only she can figure out her best strategm. Like her best songs, ""I Close My Eyes"" reveals an imagination hard at work, and the confidence in her voice and the concrete details in her lyrics imply that she could get herself out of any jam. That's precisely why the two non-album covers seem so disappointing: Both John Cale and Mike Scott are gifted songwriters, but Parsley sounds better singing her own material. Cale's ""Fear Is a Man's Best Friend"" is a lulling ode to paranoia, but despite Duke McVinnie's impressive bass work-- it never sounds as urgent as it should. And Parsley's duet with Ed Harcourt on the Waterboys' ""Strange Boat"" reveals little chemistry between the two singers. \xCA Much better is the blend of vocals on the Shivaree original ""657 Bed B"", a sleepy-eyed duet with Verbena's Scott Bondy. As Shivaree provide credible C&W; backing, he and Parsley sing about a fateful hospital stay and their voices blend perfectly as they rhyme ""goosies"" with ""moosies"" without sounding cutesy. That the two best songs here-- ""I Close My Eyes"" and ""657 Bed B""-- are originals speaks either to Shivaree's unique strengths as a band or to their weaknesses choosing covers. Straddling the line between for-fans-only and good-cheap-introduction-to-the-band, Breach accomplishes its chief mission-- to whet appetites for their next full-length.","Hi, here's Shivaree. You might know them from such recent film soundtracks as Kill Bill, Vol. 2; now, here's a five-track EP of their spooky Americana to whet your appetite for their forthcoming LP.

The West Is the Future,Kid Dakota,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3e5e6ef95969322dd5/1:1/w_160/10b4759f.jpg,2004-10-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4587-the-west-is-the-future/,Chairkickers Union,"Originally from the tiny village of Bison, S.D., (pop. 400 or so), singer-songwriter Darren Jackson knows firsthand what little comfort the landscape of the Northern Great Plains provides for its inhabitants. With the inhospitable monotony of its countryside, its brutally unforgiving winters, and summers when the crops either wither from no rain or are pummeled by fist-sized hailstones, the upper plain states practically beg travelers to keep on moving, assuring them that something better is bound to appear just over the next horizon. The West Is the Future, Kid Dakota's second album for Low's Chairkickers Union label, is steeped in the sound of the open prairie. With assistance from Low bassist Zak Sally, drummer Christopher McGuire, and guitarist Erik Appelwick, Jackson's songs are filled with vast, empty spaces frequently interrupted by turbulent dust storms and winds which carry distant smoke signals and the barest echoes of cowboy campfire twang. Jackson's silvery voice flows through this parched scenery like water from a glacier-fed spring, making him sound like a Badlands version of Thom Yorke. Throughout the album, Jackson looks upon those seeking solace from the harsh realities of this world with a sympathetic mixture of pity and scorn. On opener ""Pilgrim"" he sings, ""Howdy there pilgrim/ You're not transcendental/ There's nothing beyond you/ There's nothing to hope for"" with the head-shaking disapproval of a pioneer watching his new neighbor building a rickety cabin in the flood plain. This theme of futility continues on the Sparklehorse-like epic ""Homesteader"" (""The windmills are spinning to no avail. But nature's indifferent/ It's beyond God's control"") while the guitars spit sand and the background vocals of Low's Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker circle like hungry crows. Regrettably, there are points where Jackson loses the map and succumbs to the pitfalls of narrative songwriting, as on the stereotype-ridden reservation portrait ""Pine Ridge"" (""With their government check they go buy liquor/ and it makes their thoughts grow dim and dimmer""), a track that's still almost saved by the closing powwow pound of Sally and McGuire.\xCA Less fortunate is the over-long dirge ""Starlight Motel"" which operates under the cliched assumption (inspired by Norman Bates and David Lynch) that mysterious evil forces lurk behind every blinking ""Vacancy"" sign in the country. Also less-than-completely-successful is ""10,000 Lakes"", a song that's very obviously a deeply personal tribute to Jackson's current home: Minnesota. In addition to all those lakes, Minnesota is also home to several prominent drug treatment centers-- including one where Jackson was able to overcome his own chemical dependency. Given that heavy emotional backdrop, it seems odd that Jackson spends so much of the song trying to lighten the mood with throwaway lines like ""I didn't come for ice-fishing/ I didn't come for duck huntingÉI'm no fan of the Vikings or subzero wind chills."" These smirking jokes ring hollow, especially when contrasted with the understated beauty of the song's acoustic arrangement and Jackson's slippery, elongated delivery of the heartfelt chorus ""I came for the taper/ I came to get better."" But although there are some rough patches to negotiate, The West Is the Future contains ample evidence of an ambitious, talented band just beginning to find its legs.\xCA Judging from the themes of these songs, Kid Dakota wouldn't approve overly optimistic predictions of their future. So suffice it to say that here the band displays a potential similar to what you might've detected on Modest Mouse's earliest releases had you been paying better attention, and that it should be fun to see what Jackson and his cohorts can deliver.","Kid Dakota's second release for Low's Chairkicker's Union label plays around in the open air, kicking up some dust and carrying the echoes of campfire twang.

The Wilco Book,Wilco,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa36b1335d7bf169961f/1:1/w_160/8da34b95.jpg,2004-10-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8681-the-wilco-book/,Picturebox,"In 2002, Wilco evolved. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot documented a complete metamorphosis from unassuming Midwestern roots-rock band to arty urban ensemble. The change has had both positive and negative effects on the group, leading them not only to create what is widely considered to be one of this century's first truly classic albums, but also to follow it with the self-consciously jammy A Ghost Is Born, a calculatedly ""difficult"" record whose 10- and 15-minute marathons divided the group's fanbase and drew mixed reactions from critics. In light of this transfiguration, it seems logical that we now have The Wilco Book. If you always loved liner notes, check this shit out-- these liners are so ridiculous that the music is purely an afterthought. Okay, that's not strictly true. Or it's at least not fair. The Wilco Book provides a visual representation of the band's state of mind circa 2002-2004, as it underwent its most difficult changes: the turnover of membership, and the complete overhaul of the band's sound. That said, don't come looking for gossip or dirt, because it ain't here. The most controversial item is the revelation that Mikael Jorgensen had to ban Jeff Tweedy from playing slap bass in the control room. Jay Bennett? He's alluded to briefly in an essay. Max Johnston and Ken Coomer? Consigned completely to the memory hole. Wilco did not set out to make their autobiography here, and they don't talk about their past much at all in these blog-like ruminations. Their writing is surprisingly humble, though-- Jeff Tweedy seems to abhor talking himself up, and Mikael Jorgensen, whose contributions are huge (especially for such a new member) lends massive insight into the band's recording and rehearsal process. Glenn Kotche's drawings of percussion instruments-- ""Inglenntions"" Tweedy calls them-- are amusing and poignant, as are Tweedy's calming exercises, including sheets on which he's written the numbers 1-100. The band's sound engineers and techs chip in their own thoughts on live sound and equipment, and the inimitable Walter Sear of Sear Sound Studios fame tells his story candidly. But then there are the essays by Henry Miller and Rick Moody, which I fall asleep just thinking about. Miller's was written in 1962 and is a ponderous musing on watercolors and about a million other things, while Moody deconstructs the Wilco discography album by album. The analytical overreach in Moody's essay is so embarrassing that I'm surprised the band wound up including it. Put it this way: Would you publish photos of someone giving you a limp handjob? Truth told, you could say that this tome's text exists primarily to provide the illusion of substance beyond imagery. And that wouldn't necessarily be an insult, as The Wilco Book's agenda is clearly visual. Near the back, there's a brief (almost hidden) mention of Hipgnosis, the company whose artwork adorned many a prog-rock album cover in the 70s, which is revealing-- this book isn't meant as a comment on the music that comes with it so much as a visual accompaniment. And at that, it's succeeds beautifully. I didn't want to touch the middle pages with Fred Tomasselli's stunningly complex pattern art while eating my foccacia because I was afraid I might ruin it. And, oh right: How's the music? Well, naturally, for the hardest of the Wilco corps, the music is the thing, yes. And the disc, which compiles material from the recording sessions leading up to A Ghost Is Born, has its share of worthy material. It also has its share of unworthy material, so there's some trade-off, certainly. Do you need ""Hamami""? It's a few minutes of the band members dropping percussive objects in a room with great acoustics more or less at random, and that's exactly what it sounds like. But you might-- if you are one of said xtreme fans-- need the lovely alternate version of Ghost's ""Hummingbird"", which features a clubby kickdrum and actually fits the mood and tenor of that album better than the version that made the cut. Several of these tracks are edits of lengthy jam sessions, and a few stick well-- opener ""Pure Bug Beauty"" in particular. It reminds me a lot of Califone's Deceleration series, with lovely autoharp and piano, yet also feels similar in tone to the outro of ""Reservations"" or the intro to ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"". ""What Good Am I"" was recorded in a Perth, Australia hotel room by ex-member Leroy Bach, Tweedy and Jorgensen, and it's perfect, right down to the lo-fi quality and off-the-cuff performance. My favorite of these songs is the instrumental ""Diamond Claw"", a contender for Ghost that was left off... why? It has beautiful, George Harrison/Segovia guitar runs, haunting percussion, pretty piano, and the kind of direct emotional appeal found in Wilco's more conventional earlier work. So what to make of this whole package, then? Well, choosing just one rating was a chore. It's a great book as far as showpieces go, and it does contain a lot of great information for fans, even if it did make me hate Rick Moody. Wilco being a rock band, though, it's the music that most people will come for, and that rates only fair, with seven or eight good-to-great tracks balanced by a handful of ugly little ducklings that never got to be swans. If you're serious about this band-- and I mean, like, deathly serious-- go for it. But if you just dropped in to see what condition their condition was in, hold off and let them carve a place in your life first. Once they've done that, you can decide if it's worth adding this to it.","We don't usually review books, but seeing that this one includes a bonus disc featuring an entire album's worth of previously unreleased material recorded during the sessions that led to this year's A Ghost Is Born LP, we thought we should make an exception.

High Water / Collecting the Kid,El-P,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc22eb335119a49ecbbe/1:1/w_160/7ab6fce1.jpg,2004-10-31 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11729-high-water-markcollecting-the-kid/,Thirsty Ear,"When El-P isn't busy running the Def Jux label, composing beats for an ill-fated Cannibal Ox collaboration, scoring independent New York graffiti films, and getting trashed with rapper Camu Tao in their Central Services side project, he's now vying for prominence as a credible jazz composer. Earlier this year, El-P made an unexpected leap into jazz-fusion territory, following DJ Spooky's footsteps by producing an installment of the Thirsty Ear label's Blue Series Continuum project. Matthew Shipp and other Thirsty Ear regulars worked with El-P on several loose compositions (""Sunrise Over Bklyn"" was released as an EP last year), and the result is a compelling synthesis of the hip-hop producer's talents and the solid ensemble work of the Blue Series collective. El-P's edits and subtle production work strengthens the ensemble's more indulgent moments. Shipp's piano accompaniment typically grounds the album in discernible structure, but on ""Sunrise Over Bklyn"", El-P's tactful synth highlights divert attention from the pianist's uncharacteristically clumsy performance. Shipp's vamping on that track seems particularly overwrought, and it overwhels Roy Campbell and Steve Swell's excellent horn arrangements. Shipp is also disruptive on the album's bookends, both titled ""Please Leave (Yesterday)"" (variations on Charles Aznavour's ""Yesterday When I Was Young""), embracing grandiose lounge-y flourishes that offset the album's carefully layered production. El-P sometimes seems reluctant to interfere with the ensemble's improvisation, which is a shame considering that the album's strongest tracks show him taking the reins from individual players. A live hip-hop beat serves as the foundation to the spacious fusion jam ""Get Your Hand Off My Shoulder, Pig"", and the dense production of ""Intrigue in the House of India""-- ranging from bossanova piano and percussion to dark trip-hop layering-- displays the expansive potential of the project. ""When the Moon Was Blue"" features sampled vocals by El-P's father, Harry Keys, and finds a compelling balance between the traditional jazz influences embodied in Keys' gruff jazz delivery and his son's hip-hop collage editing style. The album occasionally succumbs to meandering improvisation and crosses the line between exploratory improv and tedious jamming. ""Get Modal"" starts off on the wrong foot with a lengthy bit of arbitrary studio chatter and never exceeds its basic bass-driven fusion pattern. ""Something Is Wrong"" is a generally aimless mix of synths, samples, and the endless variation and repetition of an irritating piano theme. This isn't entirely the fault of these usually reliable musicians. El-P's hip-hop production work has lagged recently, and Collecting the Kid, a scrapbook documenting his many recent production projects, underscores this. Included here are pieces from his soundtrack to the Adam Lough film Bomb the System, unused instrumental collaborations with Def Jux alumni Cannibal Ox, Mr. Lif, and Murs, and previously released material (including a track from High Water). Though assembling a few excellent tracks-- including ""Constellation"", a reworking of his contribution to the Charlie Bird remix album Bird Up, and ""The Day After Yesterday""-- is convenient for El-P diehards, most of this material isn't essential. The collection is notable primarily for the unreleased tracks from Central Services, El-P's collaboration with Camu Tao. ""Jukie Skate Rock""-- with a relatively spare old school beat and squealing synths serving as a backdrop for a call-and-response chorus/Def Jux label plug-- is a throwback to the party DJs that soundtracked El-P's childhood. ""Oxycontin"" was conceived as an hour-long drug-induced odyssey; El-P has whittled it down to a lean five minutes. On these tracks, Camu Tao's disconcerting crooning over minimal, thundering percussion and sinister blanket of organ, guitar, and synth emphasizes the importance of distinctive vocals to complement El-P's instrumental arrangements. High Water suggests a potentially bright future for El-P in hip-hop/jazz hybrid composition, but most of Collecting the Kid shows one of underground hip-hop's most consistently rewarding producers in a frustrating holding pattern. His material for Bomb the System is largely ambient and only intermittently interesting (the most memorable thing about ""Telemundo"" is the over-acting hinted at in the sampled film clips), frequently coming across as lighter, stripped-down versions of the kind of menacing soundscapes that originally brought El-P to such a high level of underground acclaim. Similarly, Collecting the Kid plays like an afterthought; the album is essentially a reminder that El-P's jazz detour is only a temporary diversion from the music that shaped Def Jux.",,7.2,
Matt Sharp,Matt Sharp,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63a5e6ef95969320cad/1:1/w_160/0ffb2b27.jpg,2004-10-28 05:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7708-matt-sharp/,In Music We Trust,"Even Jesus only spent 40 days in the wilderness. Matt Sharp's solo debut is the product of four years held up in Leiper's Fork, TN, wrestling with his demons. Sure, the Son of Man's personal demon happened to be, well, the devil. But Sharp was battling Andy Warhol and 15 rapidly receding minutes of fame. Jesus went back to Galilee and was glorified by all. Sharp recorded 11 songs of desolation and loneliness, as demanding as they are sparse-- and, ultimately, as uneven. Has it been just 10 years since we came undone for The Blue Album? Sharp played bass on that record, of course, Weezer's first, before leading quirky new-wave side project The Rentals to a bona fide hit, ""Friends of P"". After Pinkerton-- do I really need to mention that this was Weezer's then-overlooked sophomore outing?-- Sharp left (or was fired; details are disputed) and became a Rental full time. If a 2002 lawsuit is to be believed, Sharp co-wrote some of Weezer's best songs. But Sharp's first less-than-brilliant release, The Rentals' Seven More Minutes, is probably the last time most listeners heard anything him. The first hints of Sharp's transmogrification from Coke-rimmed uber-geek to whiskey-soaked, lap steel-slinging lost cause came on last year's Puckett's Versus the Country Boy EP. The disc traded alt-rock for the more downcast moments from Blonde on Blonde; instead of ""Visions of Johanna"", Sharp gives us melancholy ""Visions of Anna"". Hmm. That disc's most memorable track, ""Goodbye West Coast"", is the only one to reappear on his self-titled full-length, and its plodding acoustic kiss-off to L.A. lifestyles really isn't as different from Phantom Planet's ""California"" as it would like to be. Elsewhere, Sharp follows the example of Talk Talk's Mark Hollis, another erstwhile new waver who made an inscrutably soft, spacious solo debut. Elegiac closer ""Some Days"" makes use of silence and the frailties of the human voice almost as well as Hollis, while also getting off the record's best lyric: ""Some days you wanna get married/ And some days you're drunk."" An instrumental, ""Shadows"", engages in the type of ambient noise Hollis borrowed from Brian Eno. The album's crowning achievement is ""Just Like Movie Stars"", which has been justly compared to Nick Drake. A better modern analogue is M. Ward, whose voice Sharp's resembles here and who layers these sorts of intricate, aching folk guitar figures as well as anyone since John Fahey. The words are appropriately cryptic, saying good night to Hollywood Blvd. far better than ""Goodbye West Coast"" as Sharp zooms in on a picturesque romance with the cinematic vision of classic noir. ""Bells ring out from ice cream cars,"" he offers, going on to name-drop World War II-era Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr. It's brilliant, and it's a shame the rest of the album can't keep up. Weezer fans hoping for a sea change to rival, uh, Beck's Sea Change will inevitably be disappointed. Though Matt Sharp's finest moments are well worth the time it takes to appreciate them, they're exceptions, not the rule. ""Let Me Pass"" pairs rhyming-dictionary doggerel with a ""The Ballad of John & Yoko"" melody on Quaaludes. Try the deliberate textures of ""After the Angels"" or ""Watch the Weather Break"" instead of NyQuil. Then again, there's always the gorgeously funereal call and response of ""Before You Go"", building a mausoleum out of ghostly harmonies and subtle piano. ""Kiss everyone you love, everyone you know,"" goes the coda. The introspective return of this former Rental is flawed as a whole, but the best two or three songs deserve the attention of anyone who finds as much beauty in the silences between painstakingly bent acoustic guitar notes as in irrepressible Moog hooks.","The ex-Weezer and Rentals man takes a foray into Mark Hollis/Nick Drake territory. We were doing a good job of ignoring the release, but we just can't say no to you, the readers.

They played throughout the Pacific Northwest, opening for venerable bands such as The Flaming Lips, Built to Spill, and Mouse on Mars. Besides an acclaimed debut on K records, Chotto Matte a Moment!, they had a great live show going for them-- a stand-up acoustic bassist, a computer music student jamming on her analog synths, and (their secret weapon) a theremin player who could do more than make good-looking noise. The band was riding high on their cerebrum-to-booty connection, getting cross-armed audiences across the land to bob their heads, and many considered them poised for an aural coup of the underground electronic scene. But after a few remixes and EPs in the year 2000, they went silent. Four years later, they've returned minus the bass and on a new label, with the album Sun Q. Official reasons for the long break include independent projects and reconceptualizing their sound, but Sun Q seems as though bandmates K.O. and Michiko Swiggs have simply been waiting in suspended animation. Make no mistake-- Iqu's sound is highly transformed, turning up the sequenced DIY disco and leaving behind most of the experimental sampling. But Sun Q heavily traverses the landscapes of late 90s Japanese-influenced electronic pop-- the Tokyo-overdrive of Cornelius' Fantasma or the sugary funk of Cibo Matto's Stereotype A. It sounds of the years just prior to the omnipresence of laptop performers and glitchy breaks, when drum tones still had a bass-end and electronics could be as much toys as instruments. The album's lightness is refreshing in a musical sphere that has, across the board, come to take itself far too seriously; when it gets overly cutesy, however, it becomes easily dismissible as derivative. It feels odd to dub an album hearkening back just half-a-decade ""dated,"" but Sun Q's combination of turntable scratches, vocoders, and bubbly vibe would have held more appeal a few years ago. The album is a mash of styles that can be generally categorized as ""alien pop""-- mutated top 40, broken disco, and hyperactive glam instrumentals that flow along at a stream-of-consciousness pace. It's most successful and original on its theremin-centered pieces, such as the catchy, warm opener ""Under the Cherry Blossom"". K.O.'s masterful hand-waving reappears throughout-- notably on an excellent, hilariously long-winded instrumental cover of Minnie Riperton's ""Lovin' You"". The album's title track is a duet over some Pizzicato Five smoothness, and the rest of the vocal-driven songs are hooked upon deep, syncopated moog basslines that maintain a positive if sometimes cloying ass-shaking vibe. Layers of embedded surprises make Sun Q worth a close listen; ultimately, however, its ceaseless pulse, quick stylistic changes, and production are aiming at a very certain sort of party in a box-- a balance of funky and cute. It's a well-constructed album, but it does feel made for a party that happened a few years ago. Still, this duo's got the skillz and the visionz, and in case you hadn't heard, everyone digs thereminz. Hopefully, it won't be another four years before they're heard from again. ","This Olympia, WA-based ""lo-fi electronic"" group (formerly ""Icu"") returns four years after the release of its K debut with an eclectic and infectious follow-up.

Quoting America's AM-gold classic ""A Horse With No Name"", Rademaker refashions the song as glamorous synthpop with a soaring chorus. And when bassist Michelle Loiselle matches her expressive voice with Rademaker's almost blase clean vocals, the song's intrinsic tension could Zippo-light Wembley Stadium and still have enough angst and turmoil left over for Shea. Unfortunately, Frausdots rarely recapture that compulsive drive. ""Fashion Death Trends"" unfolds in a plasticine sheen undercut by tired phrases like, ""I don't feel cool/ Just a little bit cold."" Hung on a tepid guitar and faceless beat, there's nothing to distract you from their forgettable lyrics. ""Soft Light"" attempts the anthemism of ""Dead Wrong"" but it's more soft-rock foppery than potent morning-starter. Rademaker uses his stylistic staples-- a buzzing synth and twilit bass-- and the track meanders for more refrains than it can sustain. Unsurprisingly, Rademaker makes his mark when he forsakes goth-rock and embraces his jangle-pop roots. ""The Extremists"" bounces on a rollicking bass line and steaming guitars, cramming a little light into the album's dense, wintry textures. The country-twanged guitar solo and glaring organ fills are both jolting and highlight Rademaker's forceful voice. For the first time, he seems to find his place amidst the bleak rhythms. It's as if he's returned to his comfort zone. Similarly, ""Current Bedding"" also plays to Rademaker's strengths by using synths as accoutrements instead of bedrock and focusing on warm, billowing melodies and first-dance sentimentality. As it does on ""The Extremists"", the shift from the blood-drained sounds of the Thatcher-era UK to subtle organ lines and steady beats augments Rademaker's voice. He's less Bono and more Paul Westerberg-- and for he and the Frausdots, it's a better fit.","On this Sub Pop release, erstwhile Beachwood Sparks member Brent Rademaker ID's the first three rules of fashion and aims to strike a balance between sun-soaked jangle-pop and 1980s Anglo gloom.

Here Comes Everyone,Aloha,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05db1335d7bf1697fdc/1:1/w_160/2c8f4aa5.jpg,2004-10-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/129-here-comes-everyone/,Polyvinyl,"Aloha's spacey, transient improvisational post-rock stood out in an increasingly bloated genre, so it was a slight surprise when the band followed the expansive, jazz-influenced experimentation of its 2001 debut, That's Your Fire, by laying a thick anthemic prog veneer over 2002's Sugar. Now on Here Comes Everyone, Aloha make a another shift, curbing their penchant for improvisatory exploration and instead embracing simple rock arrangements and discernible pop hooks. Given Aloha's frequently shifting roster (multi-percussionist T.J. Lipple joined the band in 2003 and helped produce this album) and this series of sonic changes, the only constant in their career is the music press' obsession with the band's vibraphone-- which garners more ink than any individual member of the group. The band's turn to more traditional pop structures may limit its scope but it enhances the immediate power of their songs. Perhaps most notably, it also makes lead vocalist Tony Cavallario a more commanding presence, and he counterbalances his band's more confining compositional model with some of his most evocative vocal melodies and lyrics to date. ""You've Escaped"" is grounded by a simple acoustic guitar progression, with dulcet percussive flourishes and piano figures relegated to a purely textural role. Here, as well as on spare piano-driven ballads such as ""Setting Up Shop"" and ""Perry Como Gold"", Aloha's engine room comes across as a competent but submissive backing band indulging Cavallario's singer/songwriter leanings. Despite the album's often rigid arrangements, most of its songs possess an ephemeral weightlessness. ""Water Your Hands"" combines a swirling melange of marimba, mellotron, and electronic textures with a sublime Sufjan Stevens-esque group chorus, and is one of the album's strongest moments. Cavallario's depiction of life on the road is spot-on: The song's eerie roadside memorials and vacant Roy Rogers rest stops serve as a literal manifestation of the album's general state of limbo. The bright but restrained marimba textures of ""Summer Away"" underscore the song's conflicted nostalgia for the innocence of childhood, while the gentle waltz ""Be Near""-- soaked in ambient synth strings and, yes, vibraphone-- invokes the comforting, grounding familiarity of The Beatles, Beach Boys, and Neil Young while retaining a bittersweet fragility. Aloha's music is more contained than ever before, but their conscious restraint too often stifles the improvisatory energy that has defined their best work. But Aloha's biggest strength is still their tendency toward compositional openness and improvisation, and the album's few concessions to their earlier material tend to overshadow the weaker, more one-dimensional songs cluttered throughout the album. Cale Parks' relentlessly shifting post-rock drumming in ""All the Wars"" is buoyed by a repetitive guitar figure and angelic vocal harmonies, and sprawling closer ""Goodbye to the Factory"" recalls Sugar's epic scope, concluding the album on an impressive high note.","Polyvinyl's improvisational post-rockers try their hand at more traditional pop structures.

"You're a Woman, I'm a Machine",Death From Above 1979,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb99c0084474cd0c28c5/1:1/w_160/f87a386a.jpg,2004-10-28 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2587-youre-a-woman-im-a-machine/,Vice,"In the corner of every show-- even if it's the dirtiest, smelliest AS220 showcase or an impromptu Lightning Bolt concert in a Jamaica Plain kitchen-- there's always some guy with a beard talking to another guy with a beard about feelings. There they are, right in the thick of no-bullshit rock 'n' roll-- fucking noise rock, mang-- bitching about trust and love and What She Did, while all their buddies are breaking dishes during ""13 Monsters"" and sweating in the July heat and Spiewak sweatshirts they all secretly bought off Karmaloop. Today the noise is just too much-- something Beard Guy No. 1 never thought he'd say-- and he takes a taxi back to his parents' house in Greenwich, climbs into his Throbbing Gristle pajamas, and cries cries cries until his hornrims fog up. Even noise guys need break-up albums, records that can pull them out of their funk without making them feel like complete assholes-- and simply put, Death From Above 1979's second album and Vice Records debut, You're a Woman, I'm a Machine, is the answer. The album title only hints at the viciousness with which this Toronto bass/drums/vox administers its own emotional purge. The whole affair sounds admittedly far-fetched, especially considering both the band's musical history-- their 2003 debut Heads Up was good and short but merely barked-- and the band's apparent dickheadedness: After Death From Above Records (aka the DFA), approached the band to change its name, the duo responded by tacking on the legal minimum of numbers to their moniker and posting to their former web site: ""FUCK DFA RECORDS FUCK JAMES MURPHY WE DECLARE JIHAD ON THEM HOLY WAR ENDING IN THIER DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT... james murphy is a selfish piece of fuck that will burn in the flames of a specially dedicated rock and roll jihad. if i had the resources i would fly a plane into his skull."" You're a Woman comes as an unexpected and almost regrettable delight in that sense-- it has the attitude, but possibly too much substance, for a true Vice Records release. This is high-gloss, feel-better noise-rock that balances riff-heavy micro-Sabbath bravado with a tenderness quite foreign to the current Providence-born noise scene (of which DFA79 may not be considered to be their contemporaries after You're a Woman). Some might bemoan the album's accessibility, but that's hooks, actual song structure, and broken hearts for you: By turning the rock knob down a notch, DFA79 have kept You're a Woman loud and nasty and ensured a cohesion and unusual degree of listenability-- something that the harder, better, and admittedly more authentic Lightning Bolt still hasn't been able to do in concert or on record. From the livid call-to-arms stomp of ""Turn It Out"" to the scraps and squelches and metalloid pathos of ""Romantic Rights"" to the strangely powerful teenage schlarp-turned-massive Oedipal joke of ""Going Steady"" (""I have never seen you suffer/ I will never hurt you, lover,"" then, ""I will never make you suffer/ I will never hurt you, mother"") to the redrum rant of fiery first-half climax ""Blood on Our Hands"" (""There's blood on the shoes from all the people you stepped on""), DFA79 waste no time on subtlety-- their lyrics and singular jingles are huge but fully exposed and vulnerable as all hell. Frustration and jealousy increase to painful degrees until the title track's punk chorus (""Now that it's over, I love you more and more""), an avatar of the album's bitterness. This purge over, DFA79 end You're a Machine with two responses to this draining ordeal. The first is the sex-furious, self-explanatory graphic fete ""Pull Out""; the second, ""Sexy Results"", is about getting back to the prowl, and it's the best dance-punk song since the late genre's untimely death earlier this year. There's the obligatory French introduction, there's cowbell, there's handclaps, and the lyrics put Nic Offer's ""what did George Bush say when he met Tony Blair?"" hook to shame. And, at the end, a superfunk synth straight outta Chocolate City makes it clear that the DFA79 libido is back. Will the cycle of You're a Woman repeat itself? Probably, but for now get out of the corner and just fucking dance.","Even noise guys need break-up albums, records that can pull them out of their funk without making them feel like ...

Matador at Fifteen,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7acea9e61561daa5636/1:1/w_160/ea51275b.jpg,2004-10-28 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1928-matador-at-fifteen/,Matador,"Anniversary label-comp season is back again. By now, indie labels know the formula like a music-savvy University of Chicago grad student: one disc of hits, one disc of ""rarities,"" maybe a DVD. It's the stuff holiday bonuses are made of! Merge launched 2004's opening salvo, following up their 10-year-anniversary comp Oh, Merge with a sweeping 15-year retrospective, Old Enough 2 Know Better. Now Matador is embracing its move into its pimply teenage years, too, and is releasing a three-disc set to prove it. Matador at 15 kills 'em with quantity in the dubious tradition of 1999's directionless Everything Is Nice and 1997's epoch-defining What's Up Matador. For many, Matador was the first label to remind us that we weren't ""blind or broken-eared,"" as Pretty Girls Make Graves' Andrea Zollo puts it in propulsive, well-picked opener ""This Is Our Emergency"". But the new set is limited to tracks recorded after its predecessor, which means you've come to the wrong place to give your little brother a taste of pre-fame Modest Mouse. Fortunately, the 00s have been kind to Matador founders Gerard Cosloy and Chris Lombardi. There will never be another Slanted & Enchanted, but a couple of people got pretty passionate about a record called Turn on the Bright Lights. The New Pornographers and Pretty Girls Make Graves released well-received records, running the gamut from clever power-pop to angular, passionate punk rock. Matador veterans Cat Power, Yo La Tengo and Stephen Malkmus are still releasing solid indie rock. And if that doesn't blow it all away, wait 'til Mission of Burma reach for their-- well, you know. So this comp has a shitload of great bands, then? You bet your vintage GBV concert tee. Is the price right? It'll run you around $13 for 34 tracks and 12 videos. So this is fucking great, right? You know, I also like beer. Sometimes I even buy good beer. Once, gazing at a pool of Brooklyn Brewery black chocolate stout framed beneath me in porcelain, I had a revelation: something about ""the sum of the parts."" Seriously, raise your hand if you've been waiting with bated Dorito breath for Preston School of Industry dance remixes (thanks for being honest, Mr. Stairs). How many times do you really plan to watch a jokey video of The Wisdom of Harry doing their best ""Girl from the North Country"" impression? It's not that Matador at 15 isn't impressive. The ""greatest hits"" disc is consistently good, if not great. Along with the obvious favorites, Cornelius holds up particularly well-- I had no idea I'd still like the sampledelic schizopop of ""Drop"" so much. Even Belle & Sebastian makes a delightfully dainty appearance with ""Don't Leave the Light on Baby"". Bardo Pond drones like Bardo Pond, or A Thousand Leaves-era Sonic Youth. Interpol's ""Specialist"" isn't exactly rare, but it's a haunting addition to the second disc. The New Pornographers' supposedly unreleased pop gem ""Graceland"" is a keeper, too. And as for the DVD, Malkmus' ""Discretion Grove"" video presents a hilarious portrait of his goofy, ever-ironic persona, while Cornelius once again steals the scene with the mind-blowing, simple ""I Hate Hate"" video. You'll never need drugs again. Still, the latter discs are really only for total completists. Disc one is probably only new to the uninitiated, who would be better off starting with the label's mid-1990s catalogue, anyway. So a single question hangs over the entire compilation: Why? It's been five years. 'Tis the season.","A half-decade on from Matador's 10th-anniversary compilation, Everything Is Nice*, the venerable indie label celebrates another landmark. Matador at 15 is two CDs (one a ""best of"" collection and the other a rarities set) and one DVD encompassing the label's work between 2000-04, and features Interpol, Stephen Malkmus, Belle & Sebastian, Cat Power, Yo La Tengo, Cornelius, and Pretty Girls Make Graves, and others.

Nothing Is Cool,McEnroe and Birdapres,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5710c2bba1b7de0148d/1:1/w_160/5e3fa39c.gif,2004-10-27 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5612-nothing-is-cool/,Peanuts & Corn,"There is nothing worse than an MC who hates rap music. Such folks make their names by either subverting with room-clearing studio productions or make asses outta themselves for passersby to throw nickels in their hats. Given their album title, Nothing Is Cool, guess what classifies our brothers from Vancouver, McEnroe and Birdapres? On the record jacket, they sit on a bench with bored faces. Birdapres asks, ""Hey, what's cool?"" A pause. McEnroe's reply: ""Nothing."" The end. That old bit about hopeless cynics still evokes a chuckle ever since it debuted on a skateboard 15 years ago. It works for these gentlemen as well. Given that bulletproof irony is now obsolete, their verses must be judged as pure sincerity. McEnroe and Birdapres are underground MCs who seemingly spent too many long nights waiting for their turns at 20-man concert bills, performing for half-asleep audiences and then adding up every measly dollar they earned to cover gas. They paid their dues and now believe that everyone owes them. ""Holler if you hear me/ Hear me if you hollerÉnone of us will ever appear at the Apollo,"" mopes Birdapres in the zinger, ""Grumpy Old Men"". Their loser-rap can be charming-- ""Grumpy Old Man""'s crocodile tear-jerking piano melody fits when the guys kick dirt over high school bullies becoming B-boys and gym teachers trying to impress the kids by rapping. But on album closer ""F*@K You 2K3"", when they tell 95% of the world to screw themselves, including carbohydrates and aspiring MCs who email them lyrics, they are nothing more than sour grapes who deserve audience indifference during their shows. ""Fuck rap music in general,"" carps Birdapres. Indeed. The title track joins the indie rap tradition of complaining about the Phonies in bling-bling. Their horrorshow of the industry's decadence is as old as Ice-T's ""don't you be like me"" after-school lectures about the penthouses, harems, and semi-automatics he never really owned. Plus, if you're going to rap about devils in three-piece suits jacking you over, either make your audience smile (""If you take a shit, they want to know,""-- A Tribe Called Quest's ""Show Business"") or make then nod along with downcast eyes (Blackalicious's ""Shallow Days""). Just don't rub your face against the window of a rich rapper's soiree, (""Martinis and cigars, does anybody give a fuck who we are?"" quote Birdapres). McEnroe later shouts, ""People think I'm an independent and I don't want money/ But I want a fist-full!"" When they're not throwing rocks, McEnroe and Birdapres don't have much to prove besides sampling a few good records. Oh, they brag about their frickin' cool soundsystem (""5000 Watts""), drink cheap beer over credit card debt (""Broke Beat""), or fantasize about mafias that Hollywood sold them (""Family Business""). But their production is Nothing's saving grace. Every break flows with the rhyming, whether they are Mexican soap opera orchestras or front-porch guitar riffs. Our dear brothers even know it; their chorus on the crate-digging ode, ""Break Merchant"" is ""No, you can't sample this break!"" Their rhyme skills aren't bad either, as McEnroe reminds us, ""Fuck the critics who say I can't rap in the first place/ That's absurd in the worse way."" They also have the right voices: McEnroe's tone resembles an EL-P bickering over the TV news, while the nimble Birdapres sounds akin to Lyrics Born after five shots of NyQuil. But it's their choices from the King's English that sinks them. They diss ""The Worst Person"", an anonymous sonofabitch who picks his nose, hogs the basketball, and ""asks too many questions and doesn't wait for answers."" And by the way, ""Of course he smokes, because he's, like, the worst person.""","With song titles like ""Grumpy Old Men"" and sentiments such as ""fuck rap music"", this underground hip-hop record isn't likely to soundtrack your next house party.

Witch Season,The Court & Spark,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a685b1335d7bf1698e4c/1:1/w_160/b798ef31.jpg,2004-10-27 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1637-witch-season/,Absolutely Kosher,"We could all use a good heart-rending now and then, and The Court & Spark are happy to oblige. Alt-country may be floundering-- especially since one of the movement's founding fathers, Jeff Tweedy, has delved into a noisier, decidedly urban jam-rock derivative-- but this gifted San Francisco quintet have persisted, and it's paid off. The group's 2001 sophomore release, Bless You, was a weighty collection of lonesome Big Country swooners, by turns introspective and evocative of larger-than-life landscapes. A breezier and more refined The Court & Spark returned this summer with Dead Diamond River, a laconic five-song EP that hinted at experimentation but still brought the twang in bales. If that record sowed any suspicion that The Court & Spark were drifting away from their alt-country roots and into more exploratory territory, those notions are quickly dispelled by ""Suffolk Down Upon the Night"", the opening cut on the band's new LP, Witch Season. In one fell swoop, The Court & Spark reconcile their latent experimental tendencies and penchant for downy textures with their ever-winsome country-pop roots. The track's pedal steel inflections are a nice textural element. The track also highlights, better than anything the band have done, the skill and finesse of their arrangements, owing more aesthetically to orchestral pop than stripped-down country. ""Out on the Water"" is a slow-burning, late-afternoon jam overflowing with organ drones and gilt trumpet accompaniment. It would be difficult to believe it's The Court & Spark playing were it not for M.C. Taylor's reliably tender vocals, at once blithe and melancholic. Taylor is a remarkably casual vocalist, effortlessly delivering his supple melodies rather than over-singing or trying to add gravity through feigned affliction or other contrivances. His band is a perfect accompaniment: musicians who answer subtlety with even more subtlety. These songs don't deviate from The Court & Spark's previous approach as much as show an increased stylistic breadth. ""Denver Annie"" and ""Hallelujah I""-- with their meaty arrangements and strong melodies-- emphasize the ""pop"" in country-pop. The requisite tearjerkers are here, too: ""Steeplechasing"" opens with a huge, plodding bass drum beat before evolving into a somber piano ballad that actually grooves. ""Swimmingly Endless"" is similarly downcast, though hardly despondent. Even on their gloomiest numbers, The Court & Spark crack the door wide enough for the refulgent light of their charming melodies to pour inside. Unfortunately, many of the tracks dissolve into one another, blending into a mix of nondescript acoustic guitar melodies. At times, Witch Season is so sanded-down it could soundtrack a new season of ""This Old House""; absent is the type of emotional impact they left on the expressive Bless You centerpiece ""National Lights"". But fans of that album won't be disappointed after the lengthy wait for Witch Season, which picks up where The Court & Spark left off three years ago-- making emotive, imagistic music.","The Court & Spark toyed with the idea of straying from their front-porch roots on this year's Dead Diamond River EP, but their first new full-length in three years is pure alt-country-- albeit with an increased stylistic breadth.

Special Gunpowder,DJ /rupture,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9813d197565213b112/1:1/w_160/34c38567.jpg,2004-10-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2586-special-gunpowder/,Tigerbeat6,"A reporter from CNN telephoned the Pitchfork office a couple of weeks ago to ask questions about politics and music. After explaining why I thought pop and politics almost never mix well, she wondered if there were any recent pol-pop releases that I considered successful. The best I could come up with was Dr. Ring-Ding's ""Bombs Over Baghdad"", and then I did my best to offer the reporter a Jamaican dancehall primer. I later wished I'd mentioned dj/Rupture-- although that would've taken even more explanation. The probable reason that Rupture had slipped my mind is also why his politically tinged tracks are successful-- because with rare exceptions they aren't overtly political. And unlike most music with a conscience, they aren't ephemeral, sanctimonious, or dry, either. In most cases, even though Rupture's multicultural ""ghetto-to-ghetto"" approach is infused with a love for and curiosity of a wide range of musical and cultural traditions, it's not necessary to catch the geopolitical undertones. Rupture first came to relative prominence in 2002 with a pair of dense, glove-straddling mixes-- the previously download-only Gold Teeth Thief, and Minesweeper Suite-- and delivered a third, the split release (with Mutamassik) Shotgun Wedding Vol. 1: The Bidoun Sessions earlier this year. Those three mixes were audacious, eye- and ear-opening melanges of hip-hop, drum-n-bass, dancehall, North African and Arabic folk music, and splatter beats. Rupture connected the sounds of struggle and a yearning for respect on multiple continents, unifying folk traditions even when he was breaking apart sound. On Special Gunpowder, dj/Rupture retains the spirit of his mixes but tosses out the process. Instead of mixing and assembling the sonics himself, Rupture's LP features Western and Arabic musicians, as well as tracks sung in English, French, and Spanish, and guest spots by artists ranging from producers Kit Clayton and Kid606 to dancehall veterans Sister Nancy and Junior Cat to Arnaud Michniak of French band Programme. Depending on where the needle hits the groove, Rupture's music also features a poet, a member of avant-metal group Oxbow, a violin and oud player, and a banjoist who sings an adaptation of the traditional American folk song ""Mole in the Ground"". Trying to replicate the scope and power of those mixes with the limitations of live musicians was always going to be a tricky and potentially messy proposition, but Rupture has gone some distance towards pulling it off because he knows when to pull his punches. Sonically, Special Gunpowder is a surprisingly light affair. After trudging through the opening track, a performance of an Elizabeth Alexander poem, the next sound is a dead ringer for the Fiesta riddim. With Clayton and Kid606 helping to orchestrate a loping palette for Sister Nancy and a melodica to paint, the track harkens back to light, newly synthesized dancehall of the 1980s, a tone shared with some of the album's more Old World sounds, but not all of the other dancehall tracks. Both ""Flop We"" featuring Junior Cat and ""No Heathen"" with Wicked Act are nocturnal and steely, but no worse off for it. Either of those tracks could have slid onto Minesweeper Suite, but for the most part, where Rupture used to obscure or bury a central melody or a groove-- and make you dig through sonic sludge to get at it-- Gunpowder's session players do the heavy lifting for you, creating a more accessible if slightly less engaging atmosphere. A Wayne Lonesome collabo ""Dem Nu Know"" comes courtesy of Shockout Records and the spirit of King Jammy; Lily's dusky exotica-folk vocals redresses Cocoa Tea's ""Lonesome Side"" in the Peanie Peanie riddim. Excursions into glitch-infused French hip-hop and a club remix of the Latin-tinged, Spanish-sung ""Musquito"" are also highlights. Special Gunpowder may disappoint a lot of Rupture's fans, those hoping for something from the producer's first artist album that matches the tone, tenor, and pace of his mixes, but it's an unfair criticism. The methods are different, and even though the madness is now replaced by an increase in melody, and the pieces no longer fit into a cogent whole, there are still plenty of reasons to embrace the LP. If anything-- considering the variety on the record-- there could be too many for some listeners. As Jace Clayton's nom de producer suggests, he deconstructs music, but rather than leave his toys scattered and in pieces, Rupture re-assembles them in frequently thrilling ways.","After a handful of singles, a trio of stellar mixes, and an impressive body of work as Nettle, Jace Clayton finally drops his first dj/Rupture album. Clayton translates his multicultural, multinational mix approach to the LP, which features Western and Arabic musicians, tracks sung in English, French, and Spanish, and guest spots from dancehall MCs Sister Nancy and Junior Cat.

Unfinished Business,JAY-ZR.

Kelly don't like each other. They've been canceling dates on their co-headlining tour, and the rumors are flying. Kelly doesn't like that Jay got a better reception at the tour's opening show in Chicago. Jay doesn't like that Kelly simulates sex with two women in a cage/jail cell as part of his act. When they're onstage together, they barely look at each other. So why did they make another album together? It could be for money, but neither of these guys is going digging for change anytime soon. It's not for artistic reasons; both are firmly on autopilot here. So it would seem, then, that their reasons are entirely egotistical. In March 2002, the pair released The Best of Both Worlds, a collaborative album hyped as a blockbuster union of the two brightest stars in R&B; and hip-hop. But within a few weeks of the album's release, a bootleg video of Kelly allegedly having really, really nasty sex with an underage girl surfaced. Radio stayed off the album like it was infected, and the artists never even bothered to make a video. As a result, the album was a relative flop, failing to sell even one million copies. Neither artist could cope with that sort of blot on their resumes, so now we get Unfinished Business. ""In the first week, I predict a million sold,"" posits Kelly on ""Big Chips"". Unfinished Business is a decidedly minor work from both artists; neither strays from his comfort zone. Jay doesn't indulge in any of The Black Album's bittersweet introspection, and Kelly almost doesn't mention Jesus. Instead, they're both in full VIP-section pimp glide, leaning hard, stepping past bouncers, blowing cigar smoke with a girl on each arm and donning immaculately perfect white suits. They're all smoke and mirrors. Most of the album's beats are reworkings of Best of Both Worlds tracks, and they sound oddly dated. Like Both Worlds, the entire album was produced by the Trackmasters, a Neptunes-lite duo who peaked around 2001 and who haven't been finding a lot of work since. Their sound-- flanged acoustic guitars, jazz-funk piano plinks, rippling clicks-- is so clean you could eat off it. It's the sound of richer, happier times. Sometimes it's effective; they deploy burbling synthesized flamenco guitars on ""Mo' Money"" and a bazonkers gospel choir on ""Don't Let Me Die"" to great effect. But they also deliver ""Feelin' You in Stereo"" and ""Break Up (That's All We Do)"", some weak-ass bourgie mid-90s slow jam shit. And in 2004, Jay-Z has no business rapping on a track that could've been a City High remix three years ago. So, then, is Jay still retired or what? He knows you're thinking it: ""Y'all nervous/ I ain't back yet/ I'm on extended vaca/ I ain't unpacked yet,"" he says on ""Stop"". It's a point he makes very clearly over the course of this record; he's not truly present here, and rarely contributes more than a cameo. This is primarily Kelly's album, and he plays it to the hilt-- all effortless, honey-dripping purr. Sometimes he's Nate Dogg-level lazy, but that falsetto is powerful enough to have put some of the most shocking allegations in R&B;'s storied history a mere footnote to his career. And! He raps! Kelly makes a surprisingly spry emcee, dropping lines in a crisp, lilting, fussy sing-song cadence that bites Slick Rick so hard you almost don't notice when the real Slick Rick shows up at the end of the album. On ""Mo' Money"", Kelly follows a typically dazzling jackhammer Twista cameo with his own take on Midwest speed-rap, acquitting himself so impressively that Jay has to pull out some weird, breathless, gasping flow shit to top him. For his part, Jay pretty much sticks with tossed-off playa-isms about whips and jewels and getting this paper. We've heard it before, but he still does it better than anyone else, rolling syllables around for entire verses just for fun. You can hear the joy in his voice when he drops bon mots like, ""Take a photo/ Last time you see a nigga so cold/ So below zero, so froze/ So-so rappers are so sore in the soul/ Ain't my fault I'm so rock 'n' roll,"" on ""We Got 'Em Goin'"". Unfinished Business is a light, breezy listen, and surprisingly solid for an album with no real reason to exist from two guys who can't stand each other. But of course, Jay and Kelly are masters of effortlessness-- they can make music in their sleep, and here, that's pretty much what they've done.",,6.7,
Cough,Black Eyes,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e0b1335d7bf16985c0/1:1/w_160/4009f23f.jpg,2004-10-26 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/758-cough/,Dischord,"As a long-time Björk fan, I had meant to listen to The Sugarcubes for years but was wary of Einar Orn Benediktsson-- the Sugarcubes' other vocalist-- who I'd been warned was positively excruciating. Eventually, I found a copy of Stick Around for Joy at my local library, and about halfway through the first song, I was wrapped up in Björk's wild croon and the band's general pop acumen. I'd forgotten all about the warnings... until Einar came out swinging with doofus chants and the whole song went to hell. I imagined I'd be able to get through it if he didn't crop up on every song. The problem is that he does, and he ruins an otherwise fantastic band in the process. The point being: If you have one amazing vocalist, why allow anyone else to compromise it? This is a question D.C.'s Black Eyes should probably address; they've got their very own Einar. And even in light of their deconstructionist, anarchic approach, I can't see why the rest of the Black Eyes let him open his mouth. I would give the guy's name, but frankly I don't know it: Black Eyes are one of those uber-democratic bands that operate on a first-name basis only with no instrument credits in the liners. Rather, they let their two drummers/two bassists/sax/guitar/vocals/etc. lineup speak for itself as one, which allows this guy and his extremely unpleasant, wavering caterwaul to hide behind relative anonimity. At least he has the decency not to show up until the fourth track. Now, when you play in a band whose most obvious influences are D.C. post-hardcore and free jazz progressive noise like This Heat (and punks might not like to admit this, but that sax style was first developed in bands like King Crimson, Plastic People of the Universe, and Van Der Graaf Generator), it's difficult to make yourself into such a sore thumb that you ruin the chaos, yet somehow, this singer manages to do just that. And the real tragedy is that his is the only attribute on the whole record that doesn't work-- the band's principle vocalist has one of those classic Dischord voices that's a little shredded when it needs to be, but is mostly solid and forceful, a commanding baritone/tenor that he can put to a melody or rapid-fire sing-speak with equal facility. So there's really no need for the other guy in the first place. Plus, the guitars and saxes do plenty of listenable shrieking as it is-- Black Eyes are a confrontational band and their potent blasts of funky Ornette Coleman punk and no-wave sheets of feedback are visceral and gripping. The band's good vocalist holds up his end admirably, although his words typically fly by in a hyperkinetic blur, and his performance on ""Drums""-- the record's third and best track-- is absolutely insane. He's talking more quickly than most people can think here, and the band's sick, brutal cacophony coalesces into a serrated blade that cuts a thousand ways-- from the funky bassline that kicks in around 1:15 to the nasty, dryly recorded sax that flays the groove from front to back and the blanket of guitar feedback that hangs low in the mix. Even the songs with that other vocalist, the powerful whorl of percussion and frequent dub inflections (especially on ""Scrapes & Scratches"") is enough to overwhelm the band's one shortcoming. That Black Eyes manage to create gripping music in spite of a conspicuous flaw speaks volumes about their improvisatory elan and collective skill as musicians. And from a philosophical standpoint, it seems clear that they don't give a crap whether something in their sound is likely to grate as long as it satisfies the band's internal demands and conceptual ends. As a result, Cough is one of those records that demands discipline to absorb, but will eventually reward those who stick around.","These Dischord deconstructionists have improvisatory ?lan, bear-brutal power-- and one too many vocalists.

Goodnight Nobody,Julie Doiron,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9edc0084474cd0c270c/1:1/w_160/d9843493.jpg,2004-10-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2409-goodnight-nobody/,Jagjaguwar,"With the current singer/songwriter market populated by such exotic orchids and heirloom roses as Joanna Newsom, Devendra Banhart, and Josephine Foster, the appeal of Julie Doiron's music feels as simple and familiar as a cut daisy in a 7-Up bottle vase. Unlike some of her less earthbound contemporaries, Doiron is wholly disinterested in investigating either music's history or its future. Rather, her songs seem solely concerned with capturing the present-- the moment of their conception-- as accurately as possible. Last year, Jagjaguwar reissued 1996's Broken Girl, Doiron's first solo recording after the break up of her group Eric's Trip, and the difference between those early works and Goodnight Nobody is jarring. The skeletal songs on Broken Girl felt at times unfinished, her guitar playing was hesitant, and she sang as if worried about waking the cat. Here, her vocals are nuanced and confident, and with the help of such collaborators as Eric Trip's Rick White and Wooden Stars' Dave Draves, each song on Goodnight Nobody is sent into the world fully dressed and neatly groomed. Throughout her career, Doiron has followed the cliched ""write what you know"" maxim to a fault, and that doesn't change here; there's very little mystery within the plainspoken lyrics of tracks like ""Snowfalls in November"" or ""Last Night"". When Doiron sings lines like, ""Tomorrow I will be on a stage/ And I will sing the words from all of the pages/ In front of all the people/ I will close my eyes thinking of you,"" she certainly gives you no reason not to believe her. (And when she titles a song ""Banjo"" you can be damn sure it'll indeed have a banjo on it.) Although this offhanded, honest approach does cause the album to lack an element of surprise, Goodnight Nobody makes up for it with its genuine air of emotional intimacy. As is often the case with confessional songwriting, this charged intimacy leads Doiron into areas of emotional longing and melancholy. Fortunately, her songs are each so melodically engaging and deftly arranged that tracks like ""The Songwriter"" are able to delve into heavier emotive terrain without ever becoming oppressively self-indulgent. The instrumentation is kept loose and lean throughout, giving the album a dissipated electric folk-rock sound not dissimilar to Galaxie 500 or Cat Power. Piano, banjo, vibraphone, and restrained sampling all make strategic cameos on the occasions when Doiron's voice and guitar need some subtle embellishment. Though her limited vocal range may prove to be a stumbling block for some, I find Dorion's imaginative phrasing compensates for her voice's imperfections. And indeed, Goodnight Nobody finds Doiron making the best use yet of her natural tools. Ever so quietly, she continues to cut a unique and noteworthy path through the indie rock underbrush.","Goodnight Nobody-- the fifth Jagjaguwar effort for the all-folk, no-freak former Eric's Trip member-- continues Doiron's fascination with plainspoken lyrics but dresses them up with heartier arrangements.

Improvika,Sir Richard Bishop,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a470c0084474cd0c04bb/1:1/w_160/eb6209c7.jpg,2004-10-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1139-improvika/,Locust,"Thanks to his prolific activities as a member of the omnivorous improvisational juggernaut Sun City Girls, Sir Richard Bishop's guitar case has surely gathered stickers from more exotic ports of call than any merchant marine's steamer trunk. SCG's extensive travels, both temporal and otherwise, have enabled Bishop to cast his net globally to incorporate numberless strains of Middle Eastern, Pan-Asian, and North African flavors into his distinctive instrumental style. In 1998, Bishop released his first solo album-- the exquisite Salvador Kali-- on John Fahey's Revenant label. Containing pieces for solo guitar and piano, the album revealed a delicate lyricism not always evident on themore savage and protean SCG releases such as Valentines from Matahari. Last year, Bishop followed up Kali with a lengthy contribution to Locust's Wooden Guitar collection, which also featured pieces from the kindred guitar spirits of Steffen Basho-Junghans, Jack Rose, and Tetuzi Akiyama. This compilation worked so well that apparently Locust now intends the Wooden Guitar series to be ongoing, and Improvika is the first step on that voyage. Improvika features an unaccompanied Bishop on a steel-string wooden guitar, and as its title implies his playing here sounds considerably more extemporaneous and free-flowing than on the more composed, stately Salvador Kali. Each of these nine songs is easily digestible portion, with track lengths in the three- to eight-minute range. The sonic disembarkation point of Bishop's solo work lands him somewhere in the fertile geography between the Eastern mysticism of Robbie Basho and the freewheeling gypsy jazz of Django Reinhardt. But his influences are too obscure and far-reaching to constrain him to even that immense landscape (perhaps his work is best classified as one song title here appropriately puts it: ""Provenance Unknown""), and on Improvika he explores and links a worldwide series of underground caverns and alleyways. One minute, the bewitching, multi-colored scarves of ""Rudra's Feast"" dance and swirl before your eyes, and the next things segue abruptly into the percussive, Derek Bailey-like dissonance of ""Cryptonymus"". The Spanish-flavored ""Rose Secretions"" sounds like the priest preparing his vestments before praying above a fallen toreador, while the stormy chords that cap ""Skull of Sidon"" seem to signal mysterious ceremonies of a much darker order. Throughout the album, Bishop displays a virtuosity that borders on the flabbergasting. On high-wired tracks like ""Jaisalmer"" it sounds as though he leaves no portion of the fretboard untouched, and he moves with such frantic dexterity that it's difficult to imagine someone's mind operating that quickly, let alone their fingers. Rather than mere technical proficiency, however, it's Bishop's uncanny ability to translate and synthesize the many and varied tongues of his antecedents that makes Improvika so intoxicating.","This Sun City Girl's new solo album continues Locust's Wooden Guitar series, picking up the spirit of their compilation of the same name.

Shock City Maverick,Beans,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23fea9e61561daa49bf/1:1/w_160/68077818.jpg,2004-10-26 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/604-shock-city-maverick/,Warp,"When Beans' former group, the groundbreaking Antipop Consortium, disbanded in 2002, he quickly re-emerged as a solo artist with 2003's spotty but sporadically thrilling Tomorrow Right Now. Pairing an adoration of classic Warp Records IDM with his rapid rambling, the record made cold fusion of party music-- its alien synth flourishes flawlessly fused with micro-crisp glitch-beats. A few short months later, he'd returned: Now, Soon, Someday was an instantly acclaimed (and very cred-securing) mini LP that showed Beans honing his mix of computerized froth and rabid flow, culminating in the mesmerizing electro-grooves of ""Structure Tone"", ""Win or Lose You Lose"", and the Bambaataa-esque headfuck ""Gold Skull"". Oh yeah, it also featured contributions from El-P and Prefuse 73. Shock City Maverick, unfortunately, fails to carry Now's momentum. Instead, the new full-length is yet another wait-and-see moment. Maverick has a more consistent tone than either of Beans' previous records, but it also lacks the stand-outs of its predecessors, settling into bland production strokes that recede behind his always fascinating rhymes. On highlights like ""Papercut"", Beans augments his verbal barrage with steel-tight wirescapes. Against frigid electronics and a shiv-sharp beat, he slathers wicked absurdities like, ""Never let a woman plant a flag on my testicles/ Love to fuck but don't fuck around."" It's a moment of hope and crooked angularity, laying down a Run-DMC-on-ice cityscape that's shouting for Saturday nights and midnight jailbaiting. Coming after the scrambled intro ""Light of the Damned"", the song's insurgency could lead you to believe-- if only momentarily-- that Beans had reached his promise. Sadly, Beans safeguards his most inspired production for his instrumental tracks. ""You're Dead Let's Disco"" opens with wavering church bells and jangled chimes, the sound of robotic prayers and mechanized piety. As its reverberating beat chips away at the solemn backdrop, he jams dense synth noises and robotic whinnying into the mix-- it's Kanye West breast-fed on Hugo and Dumas. But the track still seems embryonic. If Beans had flooded his chatterboxed rhymes atop the track, it might have been the focal point the album lacks. ""A Force on Edge"", the second of the album's instrumentals, stumbles on broken cello strokes and static tangles. While the beat gets to its feet and slowly takes the song by the throat, the cellos mount an ethereal junkyard grind, and yet again, Beans' most quietly inspired chaos is left without the grip of his rhymes. ""Death by Sophistication"", too, chokes on a dull amorphous beat, its most unforgivable moment coming with Beans' unpleasant refrain, ""Crowd screaming like a dick caught in a zipper."" ""I'll Melt You"" exposes more of Beans' atypically over-arched lyricism. As its limp vintage-Warp backdrop steadies the bottom, rhymes like, ""If Reese's Pieces increases your feces/ Whyn't get funky?"" and, ""Greedy with girls/ Half-naked in a tickle-fight/ Stroking my ego like a handjob,"" stick to the mic with cheap, sophomoric glee. The absurdity of such boasts and crude one-offs against the geek-star groove of his academic production is laughable, like a calc-whiz bragging about loosely imagined trysts to math-club cronies. Beans always had a tendency to reach hard for coffee-shop poesie, but his brash schoolboy taunts sink past angstful overextension. Considering the regression in his production on Shock City Maverick, it's getting harder to imagine Beans ever living up to his Antipop potential. Pull out Arrhythmia again, and sigh along to what might have been.","A technomancer of deranged fancy, former Antipop Consortium emcee Beans' cyberpunk-inspired flow tussles with hyper-futuristic production flourishes.

"Thunder, Lightning, Strike",The Go! Team,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c004eb335119a49ed307/1:1/w_160/5d11d162.jpg,2004-10-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3654-thunder-lightning-strike/,Memphis Industries,"The A-Team. CHiPS. The Great American Hero. Hunter. Riptide. Magnum P.I. Hardcastle and McCormick. For an all-too-brief moment in the early 1980s, network television seemed to cater almost exclusively to boys aged 7-15. I was lucky to be a member of this elite class, amongst the target demo of these kid-tested/mother-denied telecasts. But for all the hours I spent admiring Lee Majors' proto-MacGyver ingenuity and B.A. Baracus' oppressive unsilliness, I have no distinct visual memories of these shows; just a vague montage of military-grade explosives, dirt mounds, and white limousines. The only thing I remember with any clarity at all is the music-- those awesome, supercharged theme songs that outblasted any onscreen artillery and promised more stunt-powered glory than Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon jump. And most of them were written by one man: the cruelly unsung Mike Post, stateside television's own Ennio Morricone. The breadth of Post's stylistic range and uncanny knack for visceral impact have made him one of very few television composers worth remembering, and I guarantee you know more of his work than you think. I can't pretend to know which brilliantly Post-themed programs were broadcast in the UK (although many were), but six-strong Brighton brigade The Go! Team are clearly just as familiar with his work as any American my age. Their debut album, Thunder, Lightning, Strike, is a hazy blend of nostalgia, evoking that period through a melange of action hero theme songs, early hip-hop (from 1979-82, in particular), and traces of 70s sunshine funk. In a contemporary context, The Go! Team-- not to be confused with Calvin Johnson's highly inferior 1980s collective of the same name-- could be shelved alongside The Avalanches and Rjd2, as all three share a party aesthetic whose reflection of bygone eras is just slightly wistful. But one immediately striking difference between them is The Go! Team's reliance on live instrumentation. Though they certainly do their fair share of sampling, they tend to use fragments as a means of fleshing out the battling, overdriven guitars, triumphant trumpet lines, and drum assaults that seem to break through walls with the barreling force of a thousand Kool-Aid men. Thunder, Lightning, Strike's opener, ""Panther Dash"", wastes no time establishing the band's modus operandi: Its ""Hawaii Five-O"" crash-in mates with an open-range harmonica to evoke some lost Sergio Leone-directed ""Speed Racer"" showdown. ""The Power Is On"" pops like puffy rainbow stickers, rubbing determined piano chords against surly trumpets and cheerleader chants. ""Junior Kickstart"" is BMX banditos navigating mud-caked spokes and handlebars through flagged-off terrain. ""Bottle Rocket"" throws back to Saturday morning cartoons and Brooklyn b-girl breakdowns, with female rapper Ninja lunging from dusk-cast shadows to conjure a katana-wielding Sha Rock. This record recalls, with striking exactness, a very specific time and place that The Go! Team could only have experienced second-hand, through imported television and culture. But then, it was vicarious for us all: Thunder, Lightning, Strike aspires to recapture the imaginary good-natured competitiveness of a period before realism dominated prime-time TV, when cars and helicopters could talk, and good guys always wore pleather. It's all dusky reds and yellows, shag-headed battle royales, exploding tanks, and getting up the next day to relive it on the playground.","Debut album from this Brighton-based six-piece rolls early-80s action theme songs, vintage hip-hop, Saturday morning cartoons and cheerleading squads into one sick party record bursting with surly, overdriven guitars, triumphant trumpet lines, and battling drum assaults that seem to break through walls with the barreling force of a thousand Kool-Aid men.

Key,Son Ambulance,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4adc0084474cd0c0541/1:1/w_160/d7987d3b.jpg,2004-10-25 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7327-key/,Saddle Creek,"Joe Knapp has often been written off as an ersatz Ben Folds. Like Folds, the Son, Ambulance leader composes on piano and sings with an adenoidal Elvis Costello intonation, but it's nevertheless a suspiciously shallow appraisal. Knapp never broaches the kitschy, ironic-piano-man sensibility Folds seems to prefer. At root, Knapp's songs are entirely different: murky, sepia-toned daguerreotypes of earnest idealism and ephemeral melody. Knapp's frequent Conor Oberst comparisons are easier to justify-- especially considering he debuted his syrupy drawl on Bright Eyes' Every Day and Every Night. Son, Ambulance first appeared on Oh Holy Fools, a split EP with Bright Eyes on which Knapp's ramshackle confections easily outshone Oberst's meandering emoting. Still, the comparison only holds up in regards to the broadest traits-- Knapp's songs are exponentially more delicate and sanguine than Oberst's. The parallel evolution of their songwriting styles, which culminates with Key, is more salient. Son, Ambulance's debut LP, Euphemystic, and Oberst's work through Fevers and Mirrors shared an amateurish basement charm-- imperfections were left intact; the compositions seemed intuitive and untrained. Now, just as Oberst replaced the spare demeanor of Fevers and Mirrors with the sprawling, orchestral inflation of The Story is in the Soil, Knapp has recruited a new (seemingly more refined and experienced) band for Key. The new musicians forgo the gauzy, playful dilettantism of Euphemystic in favor of expansive pop marathons, akin to the stripe of pre-millennial mainstream rock more interested in complex composition and multi-instrumentalism than synthesizers and drum machines (except for ""House Guest"" and ""Glitter Angel"", two grainy, bubbling forays into synth-pop). It's not hard to imagine the reverberating piano and gritty, soloing guitar of the album's first proper song, ""Paper Snowflakes"", nestling snugly between left-field favorites like American Music Club and Talk Talk. Usually, stylistic revision takes place visibly and incrementally, but Son, Ambulance's new brew fermented in the silence between their debut and this sophomore release, and it's jarring when the man who once covered the ""Sesame Street"" theme song suddenly tries his hand at ""mature"" songwriting. Key isn't just the name of Knapp's new record, it's also what his voice still freely drifts in and out of, and while his unsteady falsetto dovetailed naturally with his former band's looseness, it oddly sits on the impregnable foundations constructed by his new crack players, particularly on graver numbers like ""Sex in C Minor"". But ""oddly"" doesn't mean ""badly,"" and traces of the old Son, Ambulance linger, most notably on ""Billy Budd"". With its hushed synth drone, flecks of acoustic guitar, and Knapp's most winsome vocals, it evokes Oh Holy Fools's ""The Invention of Beauty"" in its calm, austere comeliness. And lyrically, Knapp still veers between sentimental imagery-- here, he pledges to follow the object of his desire and catch her tears in a bucket, and to use that warm water ""to make tea for you""-- and pithy turns that cut through the music's pollyannaish romanticism: ""You say that you're sick, but I think you're just bored."" The same goes for the skittering drums, laddering piano, chiming guitars and amorphous edges of ""Chlorophyll"". Overall, Key often sounds the way a child trying on his father's suit looks: serious, rumpled, and proudly beaming. It's an endearing quality, provided that you're not offended when Knapp's cracking voice occasionally wanders out of the precise hedge-maze of the music. Let's just hope that on the next album, he doesn't fire himself and hire Elton John to do the vocals, completing the transition and completely abandoning the tremulous heart of Son, Ambulance in the process.","Son, Ambulance follow their Saddle Creek debut-- the playfully dilettantish Euphemystic-- with a more mature and assured effort.

Sur les Traces de Black Eskimo,Les Georges Leningrad,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcbeb335119a49ecf48/1:1/w_160/d08d32a1.jpg,2004-10-25 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4963-sur-les-traces-de-black-eskimo/,Alien8,"It was my fault; I always play music too loud in the car. But I can't help holding Les Georges Leningrad partially responsible. I was parked at the library when I first heard their second record, Sur les Traces de Black Eskimo. The album opens with ""Missing Gary"", a loony song-skit where a low frequency and ragged screams ballast a monologue that seems like a skewed award acceptance speech, culminating in the problem with Gary, who won't let anyone else drive the tour van. The intro augurs the darkly ironic sense of humor and unhinged, abrasive dub-punk that inform the record, and just as I was settling in to its haywire aesthetic, it happened. Without warning, my speakers belched out a volley of bass tones so stridently concussive that my car literally rocked on its chassis; I actually thought that another vehicle had plowed into my own. It seemed like a willful, malicious bit of mischief: ""Let's see if we can blow out unsuspecting listeners' speakers."" Which isn't too far-fetched, considering that mischief is Montreal art-marauders Les Georges Leningrad's calling card. The band has dubbed their chaotic, tongue-in-cheek concoction ""petrochemical rock,"" a mangled mass of dubby Pere Ubuism, shuddering electronic clangor, lean post-punk guitars, and surreal lyrical non-sequiturs. They perform in crude, vaguely totemic paper masks, with antics bordering on G.G. Allin-style shock art-- albeit with a more irreverent and less scatological bent. Their interviews read like Antonin Artaud poems, and are more like extensions of their artistic sensibility than informative conduits (from a Seattle Weekly interview: ""We were four heads screwed on a crab body. Now we are three creatures.""). But like all of Les Georges Leningrad's giddy nonsense, a truth is concealed beneath the absurdity-- they were a four piece on their debut, Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou, but they've scaled back to three for this follow-up, which profits from the trimmer roster. While all their rasping aggression remains intact, it's more streamlined than on their occluded debut and the songs are more catchy and discernible. The story of the Black Eskimo ostensibly frames the record, but it seems like another red herring, another layer of preposterous juxtaposition. After the aforementioned barrage of bass subsides, ""Missing Gary"" collapses into rigid, whip-cracking drum and bass, cries of ""Let me drive, let me drive"" cloaked in shifting digital afflatus. ""Sponsorships"" would be well-suited to driving at night while hopped up on meth (not that Pitchfork condones such an activity); cracking drums and an angry hornets' nest of guitars buffet Poney P as she whisks her bratty caterwaul around blind curves. The inflexible dub of ""Black Eskimo"" intersperses its lockstep sections with expanses of arid, windswept effluvium. ""Nebraska's Valentine"" is one of a couple tracks built on a foundation of bass so deep and soupy it buzzes down the spine with the dull ache of a Mini Thin high. And the galloping acid-disco of ""Supa Dupa"" is as close as Les Georges Leningrad come to what passes for traditional in post-punk, all pounding drums and precisely careening bass. Cursory, half-baked references to Dada abound in modern music, but Les Georges Leningrad seem genuinely steeped in it. They're not satisfied with name dropping, they inject the disruptive, exuberant spirit of Dada into every aspect of their music and public personas. Ffor fans of post-punk that's challenging and artistically informed-- but not self-important-- Sur les Traces de Black Eskimo comes highly recommended. Just do yourself a favor, crank the bass on your equalizer down low before you give it a spin.","""Petrochemical rock""? No, it's not new material from the rumored Brett Anderson/Bernard Butler reunion; it's the second album from mischevious Montreal art-punks Les Georges Leningrad.

She's so closely mic'd on this collection of demos-- available for as a free download at Comfort Stand-- that her vocals take up your entire sensory field. It's similar to the experience of standing too close to a Barnett Newman painting and seeing only the color red sporadically interrupted by thin verticals of yellow and blue. Likewise, on Demos, Frost's voice seems to push every other sound-- acoustic guitar, soft keyboards, ambient noises both intentional and accidental-- to the auditory margins. Demos collects early versions of songs that originally appeared on Frost's three Drag City albums-- Calling Over Time, Telescopic, and Wonder Wonder-- along with covers of Floyd Tillman's ""I Get the Craziest Feeling"" and Lefty Frizzell's ""Look What Thoughts Will Do"". The demos are unadorned and unfussy, without the sometimes distracting presence of the musicians who typically grace Frost's albums. This casual setting could be unflattering for lesser singers-- resulting in a strictly fans-only release-- but here it magnifies Frost's strengths. She sounds more relaxed and comfortable, and her songwriting (which I'd previously dismissed as weak) comes across as more direct and affectingly personal. ""One Chord Complaint"" draws a great deal from a single guitar chord that repeats under her vocals, and the effect is eerily hypnotic-- an airiness reminiscent of Julee Cruise's work for David Lynch. ""Walk on the Fire"" includes street noise, children's squeals, and what sounds like someone walking on Bubble Wrap, but these sound effects are distracting and only weakly reinforce the tone conveyed by Frost's voice, lyrics, and guitar. This stripped-down approach offers some insight into Frost's creative process: Specifically, how she develops a song from its early phase through to its recording. The version of ""Cars and Parties"" on Wonder Wonder has a lovely long-distance swing to it thanks to the skipping snare drum and chiming guitar; on Demos, the song lacks that easy motion but it sounds more steeped in homesickness. A similar trade-off occurs with ""Wonder Wonder"": On the album which shares its name, the song features ragtag instrumentation but on the demo the tempo is slowed and the main melody is held together by a simple keyboard. The newly released version has an off-the-cuff introspectiveness that was traded for the original's sense of wide-eyed wonder. It's the same song by the same singer, yet the delivery and accompaniment subtly shade the meaning. The pair of covers only strengthen the revelation that all Frost needs to put her songs across is her voice and maybe a guitar. Frost may sound nothing like the loser of Frizzell's ""Look What Thoughts Will Do"", but neither that selection nor the Tillman cover seems misguided or ill-advised. She performs each track as a delicate blues number with the accompaniment of Pinetop Seven's Ryan Hembrey, Dirty Three's Jim White, and Califone's Jim Becker, and yet compared to the rougher demos these covers sound relatively featureless and broad. They suffer once Frost's voice is pushed from the extreme foreground. Although her studio work often sounds spare, Demos is even more so and, ironically, this makes these tracks all the more overwhelming.","Acclaimed Drag City singer/songwriter offers this collection of sparse demos, including two covers, as a free download.

Instead of ""Asleep and Dreaming"", Pink's debut album, The Doldrums, offers ""Among Dreams""; instead of ""Strange Eyes"" we get ""Strange Fires""; instead of ""The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure"" we get ""The Ballad of Bobby Pyn""; instead of ""Bitter Tears"" we get ""Crying""-- there's a list and it goes on, and the musical side of this hilarious send-up is even more masterful. Maybe that claim is absolutely cuckoo. I mean, it has to be. There's no way this Hollywood hillbilly called Ariel Pink knows who Stephen Merritt is, and if asked, Pink would surely play Peter and deny the man three times. Either way, I've been trying for weeks now to figure out if Ariel Pink is a genius, an idiot, an idiot savant, or some combination of the three. Everybody's new favorite Collective-- Animal (not Nortec or Soul, though each group had its day)-- clearly seems to think highly of him. So much so, in fact, that Pink's crude and crooked pop affair is Paw Tracks' first non-Animal Collective release. That's quite a vote of confidence. Everybody's heard these songs before-- they sound straight out of 60s pop radio, 80s shampoo commercials, and 90s soap operas. The melodies themselves are great but worn from overexposure. Yet the songs are secondary to Ariel Pink himself, the oddball who understands these melodies in vastly different terms than the rest of us do and, consciously or not, is dead-set on resurrecting them. The Doldrums isn't a collection of songs so much as an excessive human spectacle-- violently personal and necessarily confrontational. Think autistic kids covering Brian Wilson or Tom Waits singing a nursery rhyme or Shakespeare eating shit in an alley or Jesus giving birth to a pack of bear cubs. The key to all of these spectacles, of course, is sincerity, and on The Doldrums, Ariel Pink seems pretty goddamn sincere. It's a shtick record, but the self-engrossed Pink probably doesn't think so. Its ultra lo-fi creepiness doesn't feel like a ""trick"" so much as an unfortunate necessity, as if an eight-track was all Pink could afford. The man is free as a bird with a rocketpack. He shoots off in falsetto with a smile, not a smirk. He pens lyrics that would put Rodd Keith's clientele to hippy-happy shame. He explores keyboard presets that should never make their way outside of the Sam Ash piano room. To be honest, it's all sort of beautiful. My biggest gripe with The Doldrums is that most of these tracks are twice as long as they should be. Yet, criticizing the songs for their excess completely misses the point. This album can't contain Ariel Pink, and wasn't supposed to, and his next 500 CD-Rs will have the same problem. The songs are secondary to Pink's bourgeoning cult of personality-- the album turns its imperfections into selling points, its pigheadedness into firm resolve. After opener ""Good Kids Make Bad Grown Ups"", we understand the supposed appeal of The Doldrums: These are normal songs, except a ""crazy"" guy is singing them, and he has ""crazy"" lo-fi production. The rest of the album functions as half endurance test and half a chance for us to find reasons to say, ""Oh my god, this guy's a genius!"" in that self-congratulatory ""it takes a genius to realize genius"" sort of way. I'm on the ""he's not a genius"" side-- Pink just happens to have a traditional pop sensibility but a bleak budget. Then again, maybe it is all shtick. It's a debate that invites endless speculation, further putting the emphasis on Pink while taking it away from the songs themselves. It follows, then, that the best Ariel Pink songs are the ones that do the least to shape his mystique. ""Haunted Graffiti"" has the Bee Gees playing a frat party but its warbles and hisses turn the song into a high-stakes peep show. The song's melody succeeds here without being tied down to Pink's off-kilter delivery. ""Let's Build a Campfire There"" drops the Magnetic Fields parody and cuts straight to mimicry, and it works out nicely. Closer ""Young Pilot Astray"" follows that same Merritt line, with a fantastically whimsical melody and loads and loads of vocal overdubs for the refrain. Yet, there's something wrong about recommending any of these songs as starting points for Haunted Graffiti virgins: They're the most self-reliant, but they're also the least Pink. And that's the trouble with The Doldrums, and the reasoning behind this conflicted rating. The album is not so much Ariel Pink's creation as it is Ariel Pink himself, a real-time observation of his brain synapses at work. His nerves are either firing at Einstein levels or misfiring like harlequin babies, and in fairness, I'm hardly the staff brain surgeon.","Paw Tracks issues its first non-Animal Collective release. The debut full-length from Hollywood freak Ariel Pink is a part idiot, part idiot savant trip into Gary Wilson and R. Stevie Moore territory.

"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins",Pavement,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a015c0084474cd0bfa98/1:1/w_160/57f2f77b.gif,2004-10-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6200-crooked-rain-crooked-rain-las-desert-origins/,MatadorMatador,"In a 1994 interview with Option magazine, Steve Malkmus recalled his pre-Pavement band Straw Dog opening for Black Flag in Stockton, California. ""I was backstage before the show and all those guys, they looked so scary, I was afraid of them,"" Malkmus told writer Jason Fine. ""Like, Greg Ginn was mixing up this stuff in a glass. It was probably just protein powder or some healthy drink, but I thought it was heroin or something."" Observing Henry Rollins squeezing a cue ball to pump himself up, Malkmus compared the Sisyphean ritual to smashing your head against a brick wall. ""That's what I thought punk was, you know. That's when I knew that maybe I'm just not punk enough."" No maybes about it. The late-1993 press photos that accompany the lavish 62-page booklet included with this heavily augmented 2xCD reissue of Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain tell the story. After original drummer Gary Young split earlier in the year and Steve West, Bob Nastanovich and Mark Ibold joined Malkmus and Scott Kannberg, Pavement looked like a scrubbed-up gang of packaging majors in search of a good tailgate party (jolly Nastanovich in U-Mass windbreaker, clean-cut S.M. in puffy red ski jacket; only West's Harry Carey-style specs suggest that these guys might be hanging with New York hipsters). The dorkily collegiate look was of no concern to Pavement, because to them, appearances never mattered. That's what all the indie bands said back then, of course, even the ones who threw away the twin-blade, let their jeans wear through the knees, flew the flannel, and became world famous. But from the first Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain single (""Cut Your Hair"") forward, Pavement, on the verge of the big time, opted out. Who knew why, really? Kannberg would do some soapboxing when pressed in interviews (he wouldn't deal with Rolling Stone because he didn't like how they covered the 80s), but Pavement was never about principles-- at least not ones you could easily name. An anti-fashion statement is still a fashion statement, but Pavement was on another trip. They liked to make fun of rock iconography, but they were smart enough to avoid offering an alternative. You never really knew where Pavement stood on anything, which kept an air of mystery and made their music malleable. Pavement's sophomore outing does not contain 12 perfect songs but it is close to a perfect album. Each of the best half-dozen-- ""Silence Kit"", ""Elevate Me Later"", ""Cut Your Hair"", ""Unfair"", ""Gold Soundz"", and ""Range Life""-- contain Malkmus' catchy and highly unusual melodies (""Silence Kit"" cribs from Buddy Holly, but even that's an odd gesture) and would be career highlights for most rock bands. But even the songs that aren't necessarily brilliant work well in the context of the album, moving things along in their own way. The Dave Brubeck send-up ""5-4=Unity"", for example, is a perfect placeholder between two unbelievably great songs. And the closing ""Fillmore Jive"" ends an album at least partly about the music industry on an appropriately classic rock note, with an extended group-jam coda on par with ""Hey Jude"". Not many records are this easy to put on in the car and let play start to finish. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain has been called one of the great California albums, but unlike most records slapped with that label, it avoids dreams and nightmares and focuses on the banal. This is a suburban California album, and since suburbs are exactly the same from Sacto to Levittown, it's an album to which all suburban kids can relate. To us, the imagery of ""Elevate Me Later"" (""underneath the fake oil burning lamps in the city we forgot to name"") and ""Range Life"" (the kid on the skateboard is coasting through a winding subdivision, not Brooklyn) is instantly familiar. But really, though Crooked Rain references the burbs and the music biz, with Pavement it's the sound and feel that matter, not the words or themes. Quoting lyrics to get to the heart of Pavement is misguided. Go online and print some out and you'll see that, taken on their own, they're generally meaningless. Read the track-by-track notes S.M. prepared for Melody Maker at the time of the record's release (reprinted in the booklet here) and it's clear just how unknowable these songs are. ""Stop Breathin"" is about tennis and the Civil War, of course; ""Elevate Me Later"" is about political correctness; ""Heaven Is a Truck"" is ""loosely based on the singer from Royal Trux."" Whatever. Judging from the several alternate takes of Crooked Rain songs included on Disc Two, it seems that Malkmus tinkered with words constantly, and that the final versions are those sung on the take that wound up in the can. The ""I/they don't have no function"" bit in ""Range Life"", which most people take to be a self-deprecating line to let Malkmus off the hook for ragging on the Smashing Pumpkins fans, was probably just a glitch that he didn't want to go back and fix. The early version of ""Range Life"" recorded with Gary Young (one of eight such unreleased tracks on the 25-track bonus disc) had no such sentiment, and lyrics-wise, it's a completely different song. ""Ell Ess Two"", an early version of ""Elevate Me Later"" from the Young sessions, is also completely different and yet unintelligible in the same way. It's the way words sound and the way Malkmus sings them that gives his songs meaning. The remainder of the first disc is given over to the B-sides and compilation songs released during the period. I've always thought Pavement's celebrated B-side prowess to be a tad overrated, but certainly the gorgeous and quiet ""Strings of Nashville"" is one of the best songs in the band's catalog (love that synthesized traffic whoosh), and ""Stare"", ""Raft"", and ""Nail Clinic"" all rate alongside other original Crooked Rain tracks. The two R.E.M. knocks, on the other hand-- the half-cover of ""Camera"" and the ""Tweeter & the Monkey Man""-style goof ""Unseen Power of the Picket Fence""-- are in league with ""Haunt You Down"" as weeded-out experiments for only the most hardcore fans. The second disc, containing period unreleased material, is an equally mixed bag that turns up a few true gems. The most anticipated tracks are the first eight, recorded in 1993 with Gary Young and never officially released in any form. ""All My Friends"" is by far the best of these, and could fairly be called a Pavement classic (it would have fit quite nicely on the Watery, Domestic EP), and ""Soiled Little Filly"" is almost as good. The three alternate versions of Crooked Rain songs from these sessions (""Ell Ess Two"", ""Range Life"", and ""Stop Breathin""), and one later re-recorded for Wowee Zowee (""Flux=Rad"") are interesting but ultimately show how Pavement had outgrown Young's primitive studio set-up (speaking of Wowee Zowee, early versions of ""Grounded"", ""Kennel District"", and two takes on ""Pueblo"" were recorded at the New York Crooked Rain sessions as well. Since these are three of Wowee's best songs, this was a fertile period indeed.) Jokey experiments, a few strong songs, a couple instrumentals-- including a welcome no-vox version of ""Strings of Nashville""-- and four Peel Sessions tracks round out the generous bonus disc. The perfect dusty trunk hauled down from the attic. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain was my introduction to Pavement and I loved it instantly. I was traveling a lot in '92 and '93 and was rarely close to a stereo, so somehow Slanted & Enchanted never made it on my radar. When I finally bought S&E;, my first thought was, all right, sweet, some of these songs are as good as the ones on Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. There's no question that S&E; is a fantastic record, but to me, parts of it sound like Pavement wearing a costume. Listen to the brilliant ""Summer Babe"" and know that Malkmus loves Lou Reed, but East Coast cool ultimately isn't his style. On Crooked Rain, Pavement became a band, opened up (as much as they ever could, anyway), and sounded like themselves: smart, funny, confident, West Coast, suburban. The confidence was key. Malkmus and Kannberg grew up loving bands loved by critics, and in their short history, the critics couldn't stop talking about them. In 1994, they were ready to take on the world, but chose to do so in their own quiet and unforgettable way.","Pavement's Slanted & Enchanted: Luxe & Reduxe-- packed with top-quality extras at a low price-- was a near-perfect example of how to reissue an already beloved record. Matador now gives the same treatment to that album's equally classic 1994 follow-up. The result, Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins, is a two-disc remastered reissue, featuring 49 total tracks collecting B-sides, comp tracks and outtakes, including 25 unreleased recordings and 11 unheard tracks.

Spooked,Robyn Hitchcock,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0f7ea9e61561daa7cd9/1:1/w_160/4c189b02.jpg,2004-10-24 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3889-spooked/,Yep Roc,"Robyn Hitchcock enlisted the help of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings for Spooked-- his first full-length collaboration (not counting, of course, The Soft Boys and The Egyptians)-- and, consequently, it's the most ""American"" album he's ever made. The record is a departure from Hitchcock's usual eccentric left-of-the-dial pop, a left turn almost as unique as the story behind the album's creation: One of Hithcock's friends sent him a photo of the coronation of a new Miss Ohio named Robyn Hitchcock; the coincidence reminded the English singer of a striking live performance of Gillian Welch's ""Miss Ohio"". How different is Spooked? It begins with Hitchcock scat-singing a melody line that typically may have been played by a guitar or a keyboard. The track, ""Television"", has an understated but pretty three-part harmony, and even though the song's titular subject is a bit worn, it still develops a very Cronenberg-ian relationship with its subject matter: ""My kid will look like you, I swear."" If only he could have gotten Debbie Harry for a duet. The 11 tracks that follow (one of which is a spoken-word aside) all feature spare instrumentation-- often just one or two strummed acoustic guitars-- but they aren't stripped-down versions of the types of pop songs with which Hitchcock has built a sizeable cult audience. Instead, Spooked sounds closer to folk-inspired songs Hitchcock performed very early in his career, his recent forays into Dylaniana, and Welch's prefab Americana. For Hitchcock, it's both a departure and a return to his roots. The album boasts an array of instruments, albeit all played for ""MTV Unplugged"" effect. NRBQ's Joey Spampinato takes bass on two songs; ""Everybody Needs Love"" features electric sitar (one that's more Beatles than Dylan); and harmonicas, organs, and percussion show up throughout. The album has a spontaneity that makes Hitchcock sound newly invigorated, but it's a little shapeless. Spooked doesn't seem especially well thought-out, and while that could be part of its charm, some songs-- like ""Creeped Out"" and ""We're Gonna Live in the Trees""-- sound underdeveloped and often outright irritating. Furthermore, this austere folk sound isn't always the best setting for Hitchcock's voice and songwriting. While ""Television"" and ""Flanagan's Song"" sound perfectly suited to this sound, ""If You Know Time"" and the nearly a cappella ""Demons and Fiends"" cry out for a faster tempo, a sturdy backbeat, and an electric guitar. What holds Spooked together is the same thing that seems to have inspired its title: Hitchcock's fascination with America and American music, which suggests a darker reading of the album, one that depicts the United States as a terminally spooky place, akin to Greil Marcus' ""old weird America."" Hitchcock's is a new weird America: There's a palpable eeriness behind the fluorescent sheen of strip malls, suburban sprawl, and dubious politics. He namedrops Condoleeza Rice on the spoken-word ""Welcome to Earth""; ""Creeped Out"" is about American girls who ""tell the future every 28 days""; and his cover of Dylan's travelogue ""Trying to Get to Heaven Before They Close the Door"" sounds newly, nervily paranoid from a non-American point of view. This dread, mostly unnamable but certainly strong, suffuses the album with a gravity that extends from the first song through the last. Still, for all its anxiety, Spooked often sounds generous, even hopeful, especially on ""Everybody Needs Love"", on which Hitchcock sings, ""Some people are maimed/ They're not as worth it as the label on them claims/ But everybody needs love."" That's a mantra that new weird America could embrace.","The English eccentric enlists Gillian Welch and David Rawlings for a beauty-pageant aided trip into new weird America.

Medications EP,Medications,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c56eeb335119a49ed9e0/1:1/w_160/33cab34d.gif,2004-10-24 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5610-medications-ep/,Dischord,"If you've followed D.C. music for any appreciable amount of time, chances are you've heard of Medications. No, they're not the alternative rock ""supergroup"" featuring ex-members of Ugly Kid Joe, Soulfly, Machine Head, Life of Agony, dayinthelife, and Skrew-- that's just plain Medication. Medications are a trio that look an awful lot like defunct Dischord band Faraquet because... well, it's virtually the same band. When Faraquet bassist Jeff Boswell went his own way in 2003, that band's drummer, Chad Molter, stepped into his spot alongside guitarist Devin Ocampo, and Andrew Becker was brought in to man the traps. Unsurprisingly, then, Medications sound a lot like Faraquet-- the same two guys are handling the vocals, and Ocampo's knotty guitar lines still slither and slash through the arrangements like murderous hydras. Medications have toned back the odd meters, and Ocampo and Molter frequently engage in two-part harmonizing, which gives Medications a much poppier, more melodic angle on the D.C. sound than their ancestor band. Indeed, there are moments when the vocal melodies veer almost into Real Book territory, evoking the pop melodies of a bygone era-- albeit over pounding drums, shimmying hand percussion, and contorted guitar riffs. ""Exercise Your Futility"" contains a pronounced (and surprising) nod to The Kinks' music hall sensibilities in its middle eight. (How many times do you get to mention the ""middle eight"" in a Dischord review?). But again, that melody is alongside guitars that would have caused embarrassing bowel shifts in Rodgers & Hart, as well as perfectly honed Dischord lyrical volleys such as, ""'Forget crawling the distance,' I slowly groan/ Tired of inspiration/ Trying to catch my breath all alone."" The track's bass and percussion are funky, and the declamatory verse vocals drop into the pocket with intense, swaggering efficiency-- if there were a Dischord textbook, this might be one of its first lessons. Opener ""Safe and Sorry"" sports no hint of the distinguishing characteristics that separate Medications from Faraquet: The production duo of Chad Clark and T.J. Lipple give it a sympathetically dry and wiry sound, one that gives Ocampo's guitar the character of a pile of gnarled sticks. But by the time you reach the hand percussion coda that caps off ""Domestic Animals"", the differences are stark: Ocampo is throwing lead lines that he never would have played on The View from This Tower, and Medications are spitting out anthems where Faraquet would have been content with splintered grooves and sing-speak anti-melody. So count Medications as a small step in a bolder direction for the former members of Faraquet. Hopefully, their first full-length expands on what this EP delivers because these five songs are memorable and accessible enough to both make inroads outside of the D.C. scene and its admirers and-- along with Q and Not U and Fugazi-- help forge some shifts within that scene itself.","Two-thirds of the now-defunct D.C. post-hardcore band Faraquet return as Medications on this self-titled, five-song Dischord debut.

The Dead Texan,The Dead Texan,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb97eb335119a49eca8e/1:1/w_160/5ad42e81.jpg,2004-10-24 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2585-the-dead-texan/,Kranky,"I once asked a middle-aged composer I'd come to know-- one who writes fairly ""difficult"" art-music-- what she'd been listening to lately. Based on the complex theories behind her work, I figured she could introduce me to some crazy stuff. But she looked at me as though the question held little interest and said, ""I don't know... Bach, mostly. And a lot of folk music. Some Pink Floyd."" I was pretty surprised that, given the amount of mental effort her work asked of its listeners, she herself kept to music with such direct emotional power. Still, it's an understandable inconsistency-- ""cutting-edge"" music isn't always synonymous with ""inviting."" No matter how much I dig Milton Babbitt, I'm more likely to put on Iron & Wine when I get home. The IDM/ambient sphere of artists and listeners has always had an underlying interest in marrying these extremes. (For example, Aphex Twin works at both the most abrasive and warm ends of the spectrum.) Many artists on the Kranky label are concerned with creating a synthesis of music that has ""artistic"" merit and that which remains inviting, and The Dead Texan is an album that achieves such a goal. It's a refined, original sound, but one that gives a listener more than it takes. The Dead Texan is Adam Wiltzie, one half of Stars of the Lid, a band that has produced some of the best guitar-based ambient/drone music of the past 10 years. Rather than take the Fennesz or Keith Fullerton Whitman approach of mutating and splicing guitar tones, SOTL create reverberant drones through the expert manipulation of attack and decay. Wiltzie recorded the material for The Dead Texan while in Belgium and deemed it too ""aggressive"" for SOTL. And it is, though ""aggressive"" is a relative term when applied to music that sits upon the brink of consciousness. Wiltzie doesn't depart dramatically from SOTL's most recent full-length, The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid; he employs similar two-chord repetitions, swells of stacked-fifths, and utilizes many of the same timbres-- swirling string-quartet drones and effects-laden piano. But as The Dead Texan, Wiltzie's music takes on a more composed quality. It cycles through complete chord progressions, allows steady rhythmic pulses, lets loose just a little bit of dissonance, and occasionally overlays vocals or an instrumental melody. His drones are accented with acoustic and slide guitars, as well as occasional samples and sine waves. While by no means traditional songs, the pieces of The Dead Texan thus feel at least like miniatures-- more manageable than SOTL's wide-open scapes, which can be devoid of reference points. It's a wildly overused trope to describe dramatic instrumental music as ""the soundtrack to ________"" (e.g.: a rainy day, a lonely drive, an acid trip, a bear attack)-- the phrase is used to connote a sense of detachment engendered by such music, one that allows us to view our lives as a movie. But in this case, discussing the record's cinematic leanings is justified. Wiltzie has stated the influence of several film composers, and the title of his piece ""La Ballade d'Alain Georges"" namedrops an old French actor. More overtly, this release includes a DVD of videos for several of Wilzie's compositions-- all made by filmmaker Christina Vantzos. Her accompaniment for ""Aegina Airlines"" combines beautifully simple animation with abstract hues, representing the clarity of various musical elements through a literal ""clarity"" of imagistic presentation. Wiltzie shows himself increasingly drawn toward the world of film compositions-- a safe haven for modern composers who don't necessarily want to engage in ""modern composition."" The vocal additions to ""Glen's Goo"" and ""The Struggle"" lend the songs a shoegaze tinge, recalling the hushed moments of Slowdive. In these spots, The Dead Texan's sense of cathedral-like reverence is balanced with extreme intimacy. Throughout, the attention to sound-quality and design is nearly as impressive as the music itself. Wiltzie has come quite far from his four-track recording days; The Dead Texan is an entirely enveloping album from a skilled craftsperson. Currently, he's working with Brian McBride on a new Stars of the Lid release, and with The Dead Texan as an indication, we should be very excited-- in a laid-back, barely conscious sort of way.","Stars of the Lid's Adam Wiltzie presents a collection of drone compositions that he considered too aggressive for his parent band-- which means they range somewhere between a whisper and a shout.

Rendezvous,Luna,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9cea9e61561daa7739/1:1/w_160/5f597ffd.jpg,2004-10-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4919-rendezvous/,Jetset,"As you may have read in these very pages a few days ago, Rendezvous is Luna's final album. After 13 years and seven studio albums, bandleader Dean Wareham decided it was time to cap his second band's run while it was still riding high and avoid a potential acrimonious breakdown, such as the one that felled his legendary first band, Galaxie 500. As it is, Luna's original rhythm section of ex-Chills bassist Justin Harwood and ex-Feelies drummer Stanley Demeski-- which, along with Wareham, had afforded Luna a sort of indie rock supergroup status-- departed in the late 90s, precipitating a gradual shift in the band's music toward the middle of the road. Thankfully, Wareham put the brakes on before they got there, and Rendezvous is a worthy if not exactly earth-moving capstone to the band's career. Luna were never a particularly intense band, but early albums like Bewitched and Penthouse ballasted their whispier tendencies with Wareham and Sean Eden's searing guitar duels and spiraling VU/TV riffs, which have now changed from sparring matches into polite conversations. They still do lovely things-- see the closing moments of ""Star-Spangled Man"" for a glimpse of the fire that once burned regularly from these fingers-- but Rendezvous by and large is an intimate, close-listening affair, stuffed with hushed, rewarding melodies, subtly lulling backing vocals from bassist Britta Phillips, and the occasional surprising textural ripple. Wareham could never be accused of being a gifted vocalist but at this stage of his life, he's learned to tailor what he sings to fit his natural instrument, and his relaxed, steady nonchalance puts the right spin on his lyrical wit and self-deprecation. Eden takes the mic on two songs here, too, and he makes the most of it-- particularly when his Jason Lytle-ish tenor climbs to a spellbinding falsetto in the gorgeous chorus of the impeccably spacey ballad ""Broken Chair."" Impeccable is really the order of the day, as every note feels well-selected from a matching set, and even when the band kicks up the tempo-- as they do on ""Astronaut""-- they demonstrate restraint. Drummer Lee Wall, usually filling in space with his brushes and generally staying out of the way, gets to let loose a bit on the song with a barreling motorik beat as Wareham wryly references the Tamil Tigers in his worshipful/self-effacing entreaties to a lover. As note\xD0perfect as it all is, though, it's also a tad predictable, and the pretty slide guitar interjections and melodic rhythm guitar parts add up merely to the sum of their parts, which is impressive but never transcendent. Seriously though, if you're a Wareham fan, you're unlikely to be disappointed. Luna's discography-- lackluster live album aside-- has been remarkably consistent, with a few high peaks but nary a valley in sight, and Rendezvous continues that trend. All of the members already have other projects in the works (Philips and Wareham have already released a side album as a duo), and it seems as though they will put Luna rather quickly behind them. I'm sad to see them go, but I'm glad they went out strong.","After 13 years together, Dean Wareham's dream-pop four-piece calls it quits with this, their seventh and final album.

Seadrum/House of Sun,Boredoms,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35213d1975652138a7a/1:1/w_160/16ef6475.gif,2004-10-24 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11679-seadrumhouse-of-sun/,Warner Bros.,"What happened to Boredoms? Where did they go? Five years ago, I was ready to trot off with them to Neptune, digging my arm into their furry, electric heels. That was space music, right? Wasn't that what they meant to do in the 70s before anyone had told them that you can be hyper and blissed-out at the same time? It sure seemed like it. And then they just disappeared, only cropping up outside of Japan at sparsely planned eclectic music festivals (that were usually in Europe). In the interim, we got remix albums, some spare influence for neo-no-wavers, and a whole lotta side projects. And I'm not even trying to overlook the side projects, because the last Psycho-Baba album was a lot more interesting than th-- okay, I'll get there in a minute. The answer to Boredoms' whereabouts during the Pitchfork Ascendance was that they sort of broke up and went their own thousand separate ways. Guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto and bassist Hila either left or were fired from the band some time around the turn of this century. Give or take a year; everything's pretty sketchy. I've read interviews with Yamamoto where he talks about not wanting to keep himself restricted to just one band. I've read interviews with de facto leader Yamatsuka Eye where he talks about wanting to love the sun. Suffice to say, there was a communication breakdown. So, Boredoms became ""Vooredoms"", with Eye, longtime drummer Yoshimi P-We, and two more drummers-- ATR and E-Da-- who'd come aboard when the band had originally gone psychedelic in the late-90s. V8redoms have yet to release any music. They've played lots of shows over the past few years, and true to Eye's concept for the band as a human turntable, their music spins out the jammiest aspects of Boredoms' Vision Creation Newsun and stretches them to epic lengths. Live, its probably an amazing experience; exhausting, hedonistic. Speaking as someone with a fair amount of bootleg mp3s of these shows, I can say that the hour-long drums-and-synth template can be a bit trying as a sit-down listen. And now, out of the clear blue sky, we have Seadrum/House of Sun. It's credited to Boredoms, which makes me wonder if it's actually a new recording, or something leftover. It also comes with zero recording information, musical credits, or any liner notes whatsoever (even any of that cool Eye magic-marker art), in a blue plastic jewel case with cover art that looks stenciled. Wtf? Still, none of that would be so perplexing if the sounds contained inside packed that super-Bore punch. They don't. In fact, if I had to guess, the two tracks on this CD really were leftovers from after VCN. They sound like unedited, marathon jams; the kind that on previous records would have been condensed into concentrated, five-minute mini-trips, and used as part of some electric DJ mix. At best, this sounds like a stopgap. Now, that said, Seadrum/House of Sun features one of the coolest beginnings of any Boredoms album. Yoshimi introduces ""Seadrum"" with an unaccompanied vocal cadenza, sounding like an island witch serenading the dawn. As she sings her final note, a thick wave of drums, filled out with thunderous reverb like the roar of tidal waves, drowns her out. Pounding, primal percussion is Boredoms' specialty these days, and even when the piano (!) enters later, the vibe is ecstatic. The piano's black-key glissandos turn trance-rock into Asian rhapsody, and when combined with Yoshimi's re-emergent vocals, give the band a tranquil, dreamy sound I've never heard from them before. And it just keeps on going. On and on. Sometimes the drums change their pattern for a few bars (my favorite is when they pull out the tablas and tuned percussion for futuristic tropical craziness), but in general, ""Seadrum"" coasts where it should surge. Of course, compared to the second track, it's practically explosive. ""House of Sun"" is a 24-minute comedown drone. Sitars and guitars are lushly layered into a churning, monolithic mass of sound-- and like the preceding song, it goes on for way too long. Acid Mothers Temple's ""In D"" was similar, but Boredoms go for sensory overload rather than tranquil meditation; after 20 minutes, my ears are numb (and my brain has long since checked out). In theory, Boredoms furthering their psychedelic side should be fantastic, and I have to admit that for sheer orgasmic sprawl, few bands have much on them. However, at a point, sprawl becomes tedious and indulgent-- and I never thought I'd say that about Boredoms.","The Japanese super-rock legends return with what may be their final release, the long-awaited follow-up to 2000's excellent Vision Creation Newsun.

Never Breathe What You Can't See,Jello BiafraMelvins,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29a13d19756521388ed/1:1/w_160/1a33935c.gif,2004-10-21 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/688-never-breathe-what-you-cant-see-with-melvins/,Alternative Tentacles,"Jello Biafra is pissed. This might not be a surprise to anyone keeping tabs on the former Dead Kennedys singer, whose scathing leftist diatribes have been the primary focus of a consistently fascinating but frustratingly uneven career. This time, the root of Biafra's frustration-- aside from the threat of global terrorism, the Bush administration's response to the threat of global terrorism, and, uh, yuppies in Cadillacs-- is personal: The Melvins approached him about a possible collaboration after witnessing the supposed Dead Kennedys ""reunion,"" which-- after a series of inter-band legal disputes-- occurred without Biafra at the helm. Biafra has been conspicuously absent from the music scene in recent years, choosing instead to channel his vitriol into lectures. That forum doesn't seem as suited for his talents-- the singer's blistering sarcasm has fueled many biting punk anthems, but he's not the most revelatory speaker on the campus podium circuit. Therefore, it's nice to have Biafra return to his role as a polemical punk rock gadfly. The Melvins are ideal musical foils to Biafra's maniacal persona, and show an admirable willingness to subdue and camouflage their normally obtrusive sound. The band members' great admiration and respect for Biafra's work are evident in the album's malleable arrangements, which strike a perfect balance between the Melvins' grimy post-alternative metal and classic Kennedys-style California punk. Opener ""Plethysmograph"" begins with a blast of trademark Melvins sludge metal but quickly melts into a driving, dead-on Kennedys riff. The band's subtle emulation brings out the wicked humor in Biafra's sardonic description of a controversial genital device (approved by Attorney General John Ashcroft) used to administer shock therapy to perverts. The album's strongest material avoids the type of somber apocalyptic weight that characterized Biafra's late-90s efforts with Lard. ""McGruff the Crime Dog"" uses the trenchcoated children's icon as a symbol for an intrusive U.S. world police force, as Melvins guitarist Buzz Osbourne's rapid metal riff captures the demented energy of Biafra's lyrics. ""Caped Crusader"" is an attack religious fanaticism, and is blanketed in Sabbath-style affected gloom. Biafra-- with the ""help"" of Ashcroft and 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta-- offers a virulent indictment of zealous anti-terror ""crusaders"": ""God is great/ God is love/ We must kill infidels!"" Too often, however, Biafra's political sentiment is misguided and throws the album's venomous energy off course. His bizarre indictment of airport security staffers on ""The Lighter Side of Global Terrorism"" unfairly describes the underpaid guards as sadists who get off on patting people down. On ""Yuppie Cadillac"", Biafra flays the white-collar SUV crowd in a manner that might have been somewhat provocative five years ago, but now feels antiquated. Never Breathe What You Can't See isn't exactly a return to form for Biafra-- only a return to format. He's essentially sold the same brand of hyperactive fuck-all rhetoric since his earliest days as the ultimate manic street preacher of West Coast punk. Both Biafra's sentiment and approach have dated, though, and this album lacks a needed urgency. The most telling and affecting commentary Biafra offers concerns the singer's own legacy, on ""Enchanted Thoughtfist"": ""The pressure of being taken seriously/ Breathing down on me, to keep up with my extremes/ And keep on plantin' seeds."" The song's closing mantra (""Start your own fire/ Bring the world fire"") suggests that Biafra's discontented fury still runs strong, and that he isn't about to fade away without a fight.","The former Dead Kennedys singer leaves the lecture circuit to make a return to punk rock polemics, getting a little help from the Melvins in the process.

Songs for Europe,Philip JeckJanek Schaefer,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9dfeb335119a49ec8ba/1:1/w_160/4463611a.gif,2004-10-21 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4228-songs-for-europe-with-janek-schaefer/,Asphodel,"Can a record accurately ""describe"" a city or emulate its inhabitants' senses of romance, ennui, numb routine, triumph, and occasional need for escape? Avant-turntablists Philip Jeck and Janek Schaefer tackle those challenges on Songs for Europe, painting portraits of Athens and Istanbul by treading deserted streets and trying to reanimate those lanes and avenues with their recordings. Jeck is a vinyl mortician who mixes discarded records and their decayed sounds as if circulating formaldehyde through their grooves. Schaefer finds peace in discord, employing his custom ""triphonic"" or three-armed turntable. His musique concrete pieces tend to evoke an ominous sense of mortal doom, yet enrapture in the process. Songs for Europe fuses Jeck and Schaefer's methodologies as the pair chisel haunted soundscapes from Greek and Turkish records purchased in each nation's ancient city. The political baggage could be tremendous: Centuries of Greek-Turkish history are blood-written-- from the Ottoman conquest to the present territorial strife in Cyprus. The thematic dread of Songs could dramatize this conflict, but the music is so typically Jeck and Schaefer that such speculation is moot. While listening to their raw palette, it's instead easier to visualize over 2,000 years of history touchable on every brick of the Acropolis or St. Sophia. The album's seven tracks are divided between the two cities where they were recorded, yet they all share a similar and rather monotonous mood. Jeck and Schaefer mainly chose to sample and bleed together folk records to sound melancholic-- often tying 20 pounds of rocks to string ballads floating on a river. Their looped samples also mechanize the soulful expressions caught on the records-- like faint memories that must be routinely recalled. Istanbul is introduced in ""Taxim"", a funeral march that simmers with a boiler-room drone amongst scattered tinny, insectoid guitar melodies. Contorting the song's impact are abrupt blasts of corroded rock 'n' roll and random radio dial twirling. The stronger ""Istanbul Drift"" loops what sounds like construction site hammering while a Muslim prayer chant pollinates the air. Such industrial harmony brilliantly phases through a subwoofer-abusive bass rumble and a flower pedal-picking guitar solo. It's this symbiosis between the machine and the soul that makes Songs so unforgettable. The Athens tracks are denser and glummer. ""Song for Europe"" melts accordion samples into a stream of ether with female dishwasher operas and oceanic drones sailing toward the horizon and falling off the world's edge. ""Acropolis Now"" (ugh), is another danse macabre-- this time led by prancing reeds and violins, along with a supernatural, stylus-flickered organ loop that pans between the stereo channels. Making the best use of the seesawing stereo is the closer, ""Lullaby Duel""-- the one instance on Songs that Greek-Turkish tension is potentially addressed. The first half of the track is a sore-throated ballad of gentle, harmonic feedback, bass guitar jangles, and sandpapered vinyl noise. A guitar duet then emerges from the mire, with each performer separated by the stereo channel. After they pluck a melody, they jump to the next channel to keep their careful distance. Jeck and Schaefer then let a turntable stylus run off the record and their phono cartridge buzz for over a minute. It's a reminder that recorded music is nothing more than domesticated electricity kept alive by machines.","These English avant-turntablists build an audio mausoleum with records collected strictly in Athens and Istanbul.

Days vs. Nights,Trouble Everyday,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88c13d1975652139699/1:1/w_160/fba11c91.jpg,2004-10-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8273-days-vs-nights/,Turnstile,"It isn't clear which ""Camden"" Trouble Everyday are referring to in the title of the opening cut on their debut album, Days vs. Nights. The post-punk parvenus find the majority of their musical roots across the Atlantic-- aping all of the usual post-punk suspects with their peppy breed of pellucid, chorus-driven rock-- but Trouble Everyday hail from Philadelphia, just over the river from Camden, N.J. Either way, Trouble Everyday waste no time laying their strengths out on the table. The track nicely sets the tone for this taut collection as crunchy but limpid guitars steer the song toward a classic two-word chorus: ""Red light"", brays vocalist Kyle Costill repeatedly over a set of tension-relieving change-ups. The song-- like Days vs. Nights as a whole-- is constructed with familiar materials: urgent eighth-note guitar attacks, syncopated vocal yelps, and jumpy melodic bass lines. But these seemingly run-of-the-mill source elements are deftly handled and transformed into something potent by near-perfect mixing and the band's earnestness. Trouble Everyday are all about distillation: At under a half-hour, Days vs. Nights economically maneuvers through 11 songs, each complete with air-tight structure and an endlessly hummable refrain. Although derivative to the point of being almost obtrusive, these songs are uniformly catchy-- and ain't that the bottom line? Days vs. Nights hits all the major touchstones, cavorting from infectious two-minute buzz of ""Kids (Make a Living)"" to the dirgeful, Joy Division-style post-punk of ""Code Word"" to the scuzzed-up sensitive guy new wave of ""(Close Enough to Call it) Even"". But Trouble Everyday's influences extend beyond the usual anglophilic tributes to include a number of American bands. ""Written in Snakes""-- with its shout-sung lyrics and jammy, open-sounding recording quality-- is reminiscent of Lonesome Crowded West-era Modest Mouse. And songs like the aforementioned ""Code Word"" owe not only their stylistic founding fathers, but also latter-day torchbearers such as The Rapture and Interpol. As strange as it may sound, without those modern heirs a band like Trouble Everyday might not be enjoying the attention they're getting. For post-punk revivalists-- even those as adroit as Trouble Everyday-- it's best of times, worst of times: The cause cl\x8Fbre of bands like The Strokes and Franz Ferdinand means increased exposure for but also an inevitable (and, in this case, unjust) backlash against other purveyors of the form. Trouble Everyday even offer what could be construed as acknowledgment of this problem when on ""Camden"", Costill sings, ""Hey you, what you think about the new fad?"" Unfortunately, Costill's ironic salvo will likely do little to stop the knee-jerk reactions against his band.","Debut record from these Philly-based post-punk revivalists manage to tap some freshness from their increasingly plundered genre of choice.

Happy Like an Autumn Tree,Cyann & Ben,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6daea9e61561daa5467/1:1/w_160/706b1387.jpg,2004-10-21 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1722-happy-like-an-autumn-tree/,Locust,"It might be because I'm writing this review at a gym (don't ask), but this album sounds huge and sweaty. Cyann & Ben-- the Locust-hijacked space-folk space folks from Paris-- used to wear button-down shirts, smoke Dunhills, and keep their mobiles in leather cases; now their drummer is trouncing around in a onesie shouting about how far he can stand from the urinal and still ""make it."" Now come on, that's just impossible. Hans & Frans they're not, but Cyann & Ben did have a noble air to them on their 2003 debut Spring. On that album, the band took small steps but the kingly weight of those moves shook the earth. Cyann & Ben left most notes unheard and the rest hushed and whispered, extending folk minimalism well beyond the clouds. ""Siren Song"" is the closest we earthlings get to martian transmissions. Space is still the place on Happy Like an Autumn Tree, but Cyann & Ben are less subtle-- and perhaps even a little boisterous-- about their prerogative this time. The band plays as if it has an idea what it sounds like (or what it's ""supposed"" to sound like, whatever that means), and sometimes it feels as if Cyann & Ben get caught up in making songs ""spacey"" instead of letting their flying saucers attack at will. The massive whirling synth/piano/drum figures that blast open ""Circle"" could very well appear in the orchestra score for a theater version of ""Galaxy Quest""-- I'm not convinced that's a good thing. But Cyann & Ben have higher expectations of themselves, and soon settle into a stately etude for piano, guitar, and voice that leaves implicit the song's early bombast. It's a terrible case of BLOTS-- Bad Lead-Off Track Syndrome-- because on the rest of Autumn Tree the band steers clear of such stone-thrown hubris. ""Silence and Little Melodies For..."" is OK Computer's ""Fitter, Happier"" without the Macintalking; ""Gone to Waste"" and ""Close to Discovery"" brood like sumptuous dark side epics-- the latter madly bowed and Charalambidean. This is good theater. As it progresses, Autumn Tree becomes increasingly ambitious, and we're rewarded with ""A Moment Nowhere""-- by far Cyann & Ben's most masterful song to date. The beat's a little too pronounced but that hardly matters once the band begins unraveling Cyann's wrenched melody (""How many words will I rhyme?/ Does it get me closer to you?"") into louder and louder electric guitar solos, racks and racks of distortion, and a frightening Orff chorus at the end. The beautiful ""Summer"" falls cleanly between Spring's Sparta and Autumn Tree's Neronian Rome, filling the space with unexpected harmonies and synth flourishes when appropriate. ""Summer"" would have been a great place for Cyann & Ben to end their album, as the song touches upon their past and present sounds with plenty of good omen to boot. Instead, the commonplace and somewhat affected ""Obsessing and Screaming Voice in a Shell"" calls Cyann & Ben to the curtain with off-broadway slide guitars and trite RPG melodies. Which is not to say Autumn Tree runs short on good moments; what was great about Spring is often just as great here-- and in two instances way better. Aspiration comes with perspiration, though, and this gorgeous French quartet will smell a lot better after a shower.","This French duo's Gooom Records debut, Spring, was a love song from outer space (and one of Pitchfork's 50 favorite records of 2003). Now they raise the volume on Happy Like an Autumn Tree, their first U.S. release on the Chicago-based Locust label.

Shake the Sheets,Ted Leo and the Pharmacists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcddc0084474cd0c2b9a/1:1/w_160/debe293a.jpg,2004-10-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4741-shake-the-sheets/,Lookout!,"Can you feel yourself getting old? Can you feel yourself getting jaded? There's nothing you can do to stop it. Your once-torrid show-going pace has slowed to a crawl, you can no longer stand sitting through opening acts, you start wishing for anti-smoking legislation instead of bumming cigarettes, your back hurts. Older tracks begin to infiltrate your iPod, new albums have a shorter grace period before deletion, sometimes you chose to just read a book. You start to realize that the bands you're listening to are actually younger than you are, for the first time, and this realization finally breaks the dam you've built against constantly playing Spot-the-Influence. Past nostalgia starts to overtake present enjoyment, and no longer are you a first-order listener, frantically casting out nets to be the first one to the next big thing. You know it's a bad sign when even the old reliables stop delivering, when their new release barely dislodges previous albums from your rotation, when you start pleading for them to play old songs live like your parents at a CSN concert. Want specifics? Let's take, oh, say Ted Leo for your example. You and Ted have crossed figurative paths for five years now, since the night he lent precious indie cred to your college house's basement by performing there accompanied by only a reel-to-reel (even though you feared booking a guy from some scary-sounding band called Chisel). From then on, you never re-met in person, but fan-love bloomed over rush hour singalongs to The Tyranny of Distance. While living in Leo's once-home of D.C., you attended most of his frequent visits, wrote gospel-like reviews about Hearts of Oak for a rambunctious webzine, and generally formed a one-man street team for the man and his Pharmacists. Your first sign that relations might be fading was when Shake the Streets hit the file-sharing black market, and you were taken by surprise-- you hadn't even updated your wishlist. Now, months later, the usual Ted Leo delayed sink-in has yet to occur, despite frequent commute listening parties. Which begs the question: Is it you that changed, or is it Ted? Or perhaps, more accurately, has Ted not changed enough? You can't help but notice that Shake the Sheets is the most Chisel-sounding record he's released as a solo artist, returning to stripped-down arrangements and, on ""The Angel's Share"" and ""Little Dawn"", his fascination with repetition. Gone is the more aggressively percussive approach of Hearts of Oak, the drum-circle assault of ""Ballad of the Sin Eater"" that took your head off more than once at dark Black Cat performances. The Pharmacists have receded back to a power trio format, a slight expansion from Leo's recent pretending-he's-Billy-Bragg jaunt, not attempting to toy with crooked arrangements or extraneous instruments. Instead, Leo focuses on making a ruler-straight power-pop album, a facsimile of a late 70s punk-fed singer/songwriter LP with cover art featuring the artist against a solid-color background. You're less entertained by the Thin Lizzy flourishes, here on the other side of The Darkness' full-flung tributes. You're finding it more difficult to make Dexys comparisons, now that you're starting to appreciate how awesome Dexys actually was. You also find yourself surprised that Ted Leo isn't taking advantage of his political timing-- a release date Michael Moore would kill for-- just as you're surprised to find yourself looking for political music at all. ""Ballad of the Sin Eater"" was the best description of ugly-American guilt you'd ever heard or read or danced to, so the relatively limp and general ""I wanna sweep the walls of arrogance"" criticisms of Shake the Sheets can't help but disappoint. Instead, you find Leo mired in unrepresentative cliché-driven lyrical content like, ""It's time for getting down,"" from ""Criminal Piece"". But no, you shouldn't presume to know what Leo should sing about, you definitely should not presume that. In a strange turn of events, you find yourself not as into Leo's usual tics: his unhinged vocals and spasmodic guitar. You find yourself strangely aggravated by Leo's characteristic punk-scat; especially unforgivable is a Jacko-like ""shebooyah"" in ""Walking to Do"". It doesn't help that most of these vocal detours are placed into songs (""Walking to Do"", ""Counting Down the Hours"") that sound like the wait music for Splash Mountain. But the question again: Is it you, or is it Ted? Is it silly for you to hold artists to the standard of constant evolution, dismissing all efforts to double-back on formerly fertile territory? Is it unfair to apply the context of your current musical frustration to the innocent victim of Shake the Sheets? Is constant self-awareness and within-review second-guessing drying up as a valid stylistic trick? Is it possible to be too subjective when you're writing opinion pieces? You wonder if the whole second-person device has really defused the self-indulgence of this very review. Nevertheless, you hope your arbitrary ten-point scale score adequately conveys that, while disappointing, Shake the Sheets remains better than most of its current brethren in indie cryostasis. You feel a pang of guilt at holding Ted Leo to such high, possibly unreasonable standards, a pang of self-disappointment that you no longer have the iron constitution to be breezily dismissive of a review's ripple effects. But the largest pang of all is the stereotypical one of sadness, mourning the lost ability to follow a favorite artist down any path, the willful naivety to cloak any sub-par effort in the forgiving deafness of fandom. And then having to write about it.","Can you feel yourself getting old? Can you feel yourself getting jaded? There's nothing you can do to\n ...
